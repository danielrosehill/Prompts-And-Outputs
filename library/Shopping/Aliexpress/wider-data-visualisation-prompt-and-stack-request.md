### Summary of your prompt:
You are looking to build a **public-facing website** to share **data visualizations** that can combine **static and dynamic data** (such as data from APIs combined with local database data). These visualizations may involve calculations, and the website should have a blog-like structure where users can easily navigate between visualizations and dashboards, with **no authentication required** for viewing. You want suggestions considering both **cloud** and **SaaS** deployments.

### Key Requirements:
1. Public-facing website for sharing data visualizations.
2. Combination of static and dynamic data, including the ability to calculate values across data sources.
3. No authentication required for front-end access.
4. Blog-like structure for easy navigation between dashboards and visualizations.

### Possible Solutions:

#### 1. **Superset + Headless CMS (Strapi or Ghost)**
   - **Data Visualization**: **Apache Superset** is an open-source tool ideal for combining multiple data sources (APIs, databases) and performing calculations. Superset allows for embedding dashboards that dynamically update as new data is ingested from APIs or databases. You can create SQL queries that combine API data with local database values, applying multipliers or other calculations.
   - **Frontend**: Use a **headless CMS** like **Strapi** or **Ghost** to structure the website like a blog. These CMSes can deliver content (such as blog posts or static pages) via an API, allowing you to embed Superset visualizations in a structured and navigable format.
   - **Deployment**:
     - **Cloud**: Superset and the headless CMS can be hosted on platforms like **Google Cloud Platform** or **AWS**. Strapi or Ghost can handle the blog-like structure, while Superset provides interactive dashboards.
     - **SaaS**: Use a managed service for **Superset** (such as **Preset.io**) to simplify deployment, paired with a managed **headless CMS** like **Ghost** (available as a SaaS service).
   - **Publishing**: Dashboards from Superset can be embedded in blog posts or static pages managed by the CMS. The headless CMS provides navigation, and Superset handles dynamic visualizations.
   - **Advantages**: This combination allows for complete control over the backend data structure while providing a flexible, dynamic front end for users.

#### 2. **Metabase + Hugo (Static Site Generator)**
   - **Data Visualization**: **Metabase** is an excellent option for a non-technical team. It allows for combining API data with local database data via custom SQL queries and supports embedding visualizations into websites.
   - **Frontend**: **Hugo**, a **static site generator (SSG)**, can create a blog-like website structure. It’s lightweight, fast, and can be integrated with Metabase dashboards via iframes or API calls.
   - **Deployment**:
     - **Cloud**: Metabase can be deployed on **GCP**, **AWS**, or **DigitalOcean**. Hugo can be hosted on platforms like **Netlify** or **Vercel**.
     - **SaaS**: **Metabase Cloud** is a managed service that simplifies hosting. You can still use Hugo to generate the static front-end but deploy it on a static website host like **Netlify**.
   - **Publishing**: Metabase dashboards can be embedded in Hugo-generated static pages. Hugo provides navigation and blog-like structure, while Metabase provides the data visualizations.
   - **Advantages**: Hugo’s static nature means minimal server overhead and fast page loads, while Metabase’s simplicity makes it easy to manage visualizations and embed them in the site.

#### 3. **Plotly Dash + WordPress**
   - **Data Visualization**: **Plotly Dash** allows for maximum flexibility, as you can write custom Python code to combine API data with local data and create complex interactive visualizations. Dash supports calculations across multiple data sources and can be embedded as web applications.
   - **Frontend**: Use **WordPress** as the blog-like structure for the site. WordPress can host static content and easily integrate with Dash via iframes or API calls.
   - **Deployment**:
     - **Cloud**: Dash applications can be deployed on cloud platforms like **Heroku**, **GCP**, or **AWS**, while WordPress can be hosted via **WordPress.com** or self-hosted on the same platform.
     - **SaaS**: Use **Plotly Dash Enterprise** for managed deployment, and pair it with WordPress.com for hosting the frontend.
   - **Publishing**: Dash visualizations can be embedded in WordPress pages via iframes or linked directly. WordPress provides easy navigation and organization of content, while Dash handles the dynamic visualizations.
   - **Advantages**: Dash provides extensive flexibility for creating custom visualizations, while WordPress offers a familiar and easy-to-use CMS with lots of customization options.

#### 4. **Grafana + Jekyll (Static Site Generator)**
   - **Data Visualization**: **Grafana** allows for combining multiple data sources, including APIs and databases, with built-in transformations and calculations. It supports advanced data operations, such as multiplying API data by local database values, making it a strong option for handling complex data visualization tasks.
   - **Frontend**: **Jekyll** is another lightweight **static site generator** that can build a blog-like front end for your visualizations. Jekyll works well for public-facing sites, and Grafana dashboards can be embedded in the pages.
   - **Deployment**:
     - **Cloud**: Grafana can be hosted on platforms like **Grafana Cloud** or deployed on **AWS**/**GCP**, while Jekyll can be hosted on **GitHub Pages**, **Netlify**, or **Vercel**.
     - **SaaS**: Use **Grafana Cloud** for the backend and **GitHub Pages** or **Netlify** for the static front-end.
   - **Publishing**: Grafana dashboards can be embedded directly in Jekyll pages, allowing for easy navigation between static content and dynamic visualizations.
   - **Advantages**: Grafana’s powerful data visualization tools combined with Jekyll’s static site capabilities result in a fast, lightweight site that can handle complex visualizations.

### Final Recommendation:
For the **most flexibility** in terms of combining static and dynamic data with calculations, consider **Plotly Dash** or **Superset** paired with a CMS or static site generator like **Ghost** or **Hugo**. These tools allow for the greatest control over data logic and visualization, while also providing structured, user-friendly websites for navigating dashboards. 

For simpler and more cost-effective solutions, **Metabase** and **Grafana** with a static site generator are great choices that balance ease of deployment with visualization capabilities.
