# Output

The **travel warnings data** provided by the National Security Council of Israel categorizes countries by threat levels ranging from **Level 1** (No Travel Threat) to **Level 4** (High Threat Level). Each level indicates the recommended level of precaution, with Level 4 explicitly advising against any travel and recommending that those already present leave immediately. There are also **mixed travel warnings**, which suggest that different areas of a single country may have varying threat levels, requiring careful consideration before traveling【99†source】.

### **Suggested Visualization for the Dashboard:**

**1. Map Visualization of Travel Warnings:**
   - **Map Panel**: Use **Grafana's Worldmap panel** to represent countries with different **threat levels**. Countries can be color-coded based on the threat level:
     - **Level 1**: Green - Basic precautions.
     - **Level 2**: Yellow - Increased precautions.
     - **Level 3**: Orange - Avoid unnecessary travel.
     - **Level 4**: Red - Travel prohibited.
   - This map will allow users to visually understand the threat levels around the world at a glance, making it particularly useful for travelers and those keeping track of international security concerns.

**2. Time Series Graph for Travel Warning Updates:**
   - **Threat Level Changes Over Time**: Create a **time series graph** to show when specific countries' threat levels change. This helps users track patterns and understand evolving risks.
   - For example, if a country's threat level escalates from Level 2 to Level 4, the graph can highlight these changes, making it easier to see trends or regions with increasing instability.

**3. Country-specific Panel:**
   - **Country Filters**: Provide a dropdown filter that allows users to select a country to see the **detailed information** about the threat levels for specific areas within that country. This could include specific advisories, such as avoiding particular cities or regions.
   - Display a **text panel** next to the map that shows country-specific information, including details about recommended actions (e.g., leaving immediately, avoiding specific activities).

**4. Alert Notification System:**
   - **Alerts Panel**: Set up Grafana’s **Alert Notification system** that triggers alerts whenever a travel warning is updated or a country’s status changes. Users can subscribe to get notifications whenever a country of interest has a change in its travel threat level.

**5. Historical Context Comparison:**
   - **Heatmap of Threat Levels**: Implement a **heatmap panel** to visualize how travel warnings have shifted over a period, such as in response to significant geopolitical events. This allows viewers to assess the impact of recent developments on travel safety.

This data could provide crucial context to your news dashboard, especially for users interested in the safety and security of international travel. By adding these elements, users can make informed decisions and better understand the geopolitical risk landscape.
