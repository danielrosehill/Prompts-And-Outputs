To validate whether the automatic refresh feature is working as expected, you can add a few elements to the web page:

1. **Timestamp Display**: Add a visible timestamp that updates every time the page refreshes. This can be a simple JavaScript function that fetches the current time and displays it in a designated area of the page.

   ```html
   <div id="timestamp"></div>
   <script>
       function updateTimestamp() {
           const now = new Date();
           document.getElementById('timestamp').innerText = now.toLocaleTimeString();
       }
       setInterval(() => {
           updateTimestamp();
       }, 1000);
   </script>
   ```

2. **Counter**: Implement a counter that increments each time the page is refreshed. This can help you track how many times the refresh has occurred.

   ```html
   <div id="refreshCount">Refresh Count: 0</div>
   <script>
       let count = 0;
       function incrementCounter() {
           count++;
           document.getElementById('refreshCount').innerText = 'Refresh Count: ' + count;
       }
       incrementCounter();
   </script>
   ```

3. **Random Data Display**: Display random data or content that changes with each refresh, such as a random quote or image. This will visually indicate that the page has been refreshed.

   ```html
   <div id="randomQuote"></div>
   <script>
       const quotes = [
           "Quote 1",
           "Quote 2",
           "Quote 3",
           "Quote 4"
       ];
       function displayRandomQuote() {
           const randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * quotes.length);
           document.getElementById('randomQuote').innerText = quotes[randomIndex];
       }
       displayRandomQuote();
   </script>
   ```

4. **Visibility Changes**: Use a background color or element that changes every time the page refreshes, indicating the action has taken place.

5. **Log Entry**: Create a log that appends an entry each time the page refreshes, showing the timestamp and any relevant information.

By incorporating one or more of these elements into your web page, you can effectively validate whether the automatic refresh feature is functioning correctly.

Sure! Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to display a timestamp with both local time and UTC, without seconds:

```html
<div id="timestamp"></div>
<script>
    function updateTimestamp() {
        const now = new Date();
        const localTime = now.toLocaleString([], { hour: '2-digit', minute: '2-digit', hour12: false });
        const utcTime = now.toUTCString().split(' ')[4].slice(0, -3); // Get HH:MM format from UTC
        document.getElementById('timestamp').innerText = `Local Time: ${localTime} | UTC: ${utcTime}`;
    }
    updateTimestamp(); // Initial call
    setInterval(updateTimestamp, 60000); // Update every minute
</script>
```

### Explanation:
- The `toLocaleString` method formats the local time to show hours and minutes without seconds.
- The UTC time is obtained by splitting the UTC string to extract the hour and minute.
- The `setInterval` function updates the timestamp every minute to keep it current. 

You can place this code in the `<body>` of your HTML document to see the local and UTC times displayed.
