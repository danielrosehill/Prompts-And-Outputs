# Prompt

is there any way to provide a batch of URLs and validate them? Many of these don't work

Yes, there's a way to validate a batch of URLs to determine if they are accessible and functioning correctly. Hereâ€™s how you can do it using a Python script:

### Python Script to Validate URLs

This script will take a list of URLs and check whether each URL is accessible (i.e., returns a successful HTTP status code).

1. **Input:** Provide the list of URLs to the script (as a text file or directly in the script).
2. **Output:** The script will print which URLs are valid and which are not.

```python
import requests

# List of URLs to validate
urls = [
    "https://www.bbc.com/news/world/middle_east",
    "https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel",
    "https://www.cnn.com/middle-east",
    # Add more URLs here
]

# Function to validate URLs
def validate_urls(url_list):
    for url in url_list:
        try:
            response = requests.get(url, timeout=10)
            if response.status_code == 200:
                print(f"VALID: {url}")
            else:
                print(f"INVALID: {url} (Status Code: {response.status_code})")
        except requests.RequestException as e:
            print(f"INVALID: {url} (Error: {e})")

# Validate the URLs
validate_urls(urls)
```

### How This Script Works:
1. **Input List**: You need to add your URLs to the list (`urls`).
2. **Requests Library**: The script uses Python's `requests` library to make HTTP GET requests.
3. **Timeout**: The script includes a `timeout` parameter (10 seconds) to avoid waiting too long for unresponsive URLs.
4. **Response Status**:
   - URLs that return **status code 200** (OK) are considered valid.
   - If the status code is anything other than 200 or if an error occurs (e.g., timeout, connection error), the URL is marked as invalid.

### How to Use:
- **Install Requests**: If you haven't already, you can install the `requests` library using:
  ```sh
  pip install requests
  ```
- **Run the Script**: After saving the script to a `.py` file, you can run it using Python:
  ```sh
  python validate_urls.py
  ```

### Notes:
- The **status code** helps determine if the page is valid:
  - **200**: Successful request.
  - **404**: Page not found.
  - **403**: Forbidden (access restricted).
  - Other status codes could indicate redirection, server issues, etc.
- You can also write the results to a file instead of printing them, depending on your needs.

If you provide me with the URLs, I could help run a similar validation in Python, or you can run the script locally to validate them yourself.
