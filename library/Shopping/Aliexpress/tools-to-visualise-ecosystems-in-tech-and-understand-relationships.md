# Prompt

I'm planning on starting a job hunt soon. I am planning on targeting companies that are involved in generative AI use-cases, but especially LLMs and LLM agents. Sometimes (especially in tech) the sheer number of companies out there that you could theoretically work for is overwhelming. There are huge databases of companies but they're hard to wade through. A tool I would really love is something that might map out the "clusters" within specific tech ecosystems. I'm visualising something like a graph database: you start with one company of interest and then find out whom it has integrated etc. Does anything like this exist?

# Output

There are tools and platforms that offer something similar to what you're envisioning—a kind of graph-based exploration of the relationships between companies, their integrations, partnerships, and ecosystems, especially in tech and AI fields. Here are a few that could help you map out the "clusters" within the generative AI and LLM ecosystems:

1. **Crunchbase**: Crunchbase is a well-known platform that tracks startups, funding rounds, partnerships, and acquisitions. It allows you to visualize relationships between companies through its network view and can help map out ecosystems. While not graph-based in the traditional sense, it’s good for identifying connections and integration partners.

2. **PitchBook**: Similar to Crunchbase, PitchBook focuses on financial data, investments, and partnerships, but it also has features that map out the relationships between companies, investors, and technologies. It’s a great tool for researching specific clusters within a sector, such as AI.

3. **Graph Commons**: This is an actual graph-database visualization tool that allows you to map out ecosystems. You can build a network around a company and visualize connections to other companies, investors, and industries. It's not specific to tech ecosystems, but it’s flexible enough for you to create a custom graph that fits your needs.

4. **CB Insights**: This is a market intelligence platform that tracks tech trends and investments. It’s particularly strong in AI. CB Insights often publishes reports and infographics that visualize clusters of companies working on specific tech trends, such as generative AI and LLMs.

5. **Mattermark**: This platform provides data on tech startups, allowing you to track how companies are connected and growing in various ecosystems. Though more focused on startup growth metrics, it could help you identify clusters in the generative AI space.

6. **Neo4j**: If you're comfortable with building your own custom solutions, Neo4j is a graph database platform where you can create a custom map of companies, technologies, and integrations. You could seed the database with information from open sources (Crunchbase, news articles, etc.) and use its visualization tools to explore relationships.

7. **Partnerships-focused Databases**: Some platforms like **Reveal** or **Crossbeam** track partnerships and integrations between companies. These are more B2B-focused but could give insights into which companies are collaborating within a certain space.

8. **LinkedIn Sales Navigator**: Though not a graph tool per se, it’s a powerful way to discover companies working in specific niches, filter them by integrations, partnerships, and team structure, and visualize how professionals are moving between companies in a tech ecosystem.
