### Summary of your prompt:
You are asking for recommendations for minimalistic CMS and data visualization stacks that can ingest live data sources (such as data from an external API) alongside data from a local database. You want to know if this requirement affects the earlier suggestions and to receive a few modified stack recommendations.

### Key Consideration:
With the addition of live data ingestion (via external APIs), we need a data visualization tool capable of merging API data with the database. The stack should allow dynamic retrieval of data in near real-time while still providing an efficient and lightweight setup for publishing visualizations.

### Modified Recommendations: Stacks with Live Data Ingestion

#### 1. **Grav + Metabase + SQLite (Optional) + External API**
   - **CMS**: Grav (flat-file CMS, no database).
   - **Data Visualization**: Metabase (embeddable dashboards, with API integration through SQL or custom queries).
   - **Database**: SQLite for storing local data (optional).
   - **External Data**: Use Metabase to pull data from external APIs via SQL or direct API connections (with tools like Zapier or custom scripts).
   - **Rationale**: Grav remains simple and static for the front-end, while Metabase handles both database queries and live API data ingestion. Metabase supports connecting to multiple data sources, including APIs and databases, allowing you to blend data sources for real-time visualization.
   - **Deployment**: 
     - Host **Grav** (static content) and **Metabase** on the same server (e.g., Google Cloud Platform).
     - Use Metabase’s ability to create dynamic queries that combine API data and local data.
   - **Advantages**: Simple, flat-file CMS with powerful live data ingestion via Metabase. **SQLite** serves as a lightweight database, while external APIs provide live data. Minimal complexity for the CMS.

#### 2. **Ghost + Superset + MySQL + External API**
   - **CMS**: Ghost (minimalistic, with database).
   - **Data Visualization**: Apache Superset (allows ingestion of live data from APIs via custom connectors or plugins).
   - **Database**: MySQL (shared between Ghost and Superset).
   - **External Data**: Superset allows for API integration via connectors, Python scripts, or custom plugins. You can query live API data and blend it with MySQL data for visualizations.
   - **Rationale**: Ghost serves as a lightweight CMS for structured blog content, while Superset handles both static data from MySQL and dynamic data from external APIs. Superset’s advanced querying capabilities make it ideal for handling multiple live data streams and combining them with local data.
   - **Deployment**:
     - Host **Ghost** and **Superset** on a cloud platform like Google Cloud.
     - Use **MySQL** as the shared database.
     - Superset can query APIs on demand for real-time data visualization alongside MySQL data.
   - **Advantages**: Superset’s flexibility with data sources allows easy ingestion of external APIs while keeping the stack centralized around Ghost and MySQL.

#### 3. **Hugo + Grafana + PostgreSQL + API Data**
   - **CMS**: Hugo (static site generator).
   - **Data Visualization**: Grafana (supports multiple data sources, including external APIs, JSON, and Prometheus).
   - **Database**: PostgreSQL (used by Grafana for structured data).
   - **External Data**: Grafana supports live data ingestion from external APIs using JSON connectors, Prometheus, or custom data sources (like Loki for log data). You can configure Grafana to poll APIs for real-time updates and visualize that data alongside your PostgreSQL database.
   - **Rationale**: Hugo remains static and lightweight for content, while Grafana dynamically visualizes both database and live API data. Grafana’s support for time-series data and external API integration makes it ideal for real-time data needs.
   - **Deployment**:
     - Host **Hugo** as a static site (e.g., Netlify).
     - Host **Grafana** and **PostgreSQL** on Google Cloud or another server.
     - Use Grafana’s built-in tools or plugins to ingest API data on a regular interval.
   - **Advantages**: Grafana’s extensive plugin ecosystem allows seamless integration of live data sources, with Hugo providing a fast and minimalistic frontend. PostgreSQL serves as a central, shared database for structured data.

#### 4. **Jekyll + Redash + SQLite + External API**
   - **CMS**: Jekyll (static site generator).
   - **Data Visualization**: Redash (supports embedding visualizations and connecting to live data APIs).
   - **Database**: SQLite (optional, for storing structured data).
   - **External Data**: Redash can ingest live data from APIs via API connectors and query builders. You can build queries that combine database and API data for dynamic visualizations.
   - **Rationale**: Jekyll generates static content that remains fast and efficient. Redash offers a lightweight, embeddable data visualization solution that integrates live API data alongside SQLite or other database queries.
   - **Deployment**:
     - **Jekyll** can be deployed to GitHub Pages (or another static site host).
     - Host **Redash** and **SQLite** on a cloud platform (e.g., Google Cloud).
     - Redash can combine API data with SQLite data to create live, dynamic dashboards.
   - **Advantages**: Lightweight, static CMS with dynamic visualizations through Redash. The stack remains minimal while supporting live data ingestion via Redash’s API connectors.

#### 5. **Next.js (Headless) + Metabase + PostgreSQL + External API**
   - **CMS**: Next.js (headless CMS, supports static site generation or server-side rendering).
   - **Data Visualization**: Metabase (visualizations from databases and APIs).
   - **Database**: PostgreSQL (shared between Next.js and Metabase).
   - **External Data**: Metabase integrates with APIs, allowing live data to be merged with PostgreSQL data.
   - **Rationale**: Next.js offers a flexible CMS solution with server-side rendering or static generation, making it ideal for sites that require dynamic updates. Metabase handles both the local data and API connections. Next.js and Metabase can share the PostgreSQL database for efficient data management.
   - **Deployment**:
     - Deploy **Next.js** and **Metabase** on Google Cloud or DigitalOcean.
     - **PostgreSQL** serves as the shared data source.
     - Use Metabase’s ability to query APIs in real-time for dynamic visualizations.
   - **Advantages**: Headless CMS with a dynamic frontend, combined with Metabase’s strong querying and API integration capabilities.

### General Recommendations for Live Data Ingestion:
- **Data Source Flexibility**: Grafana, Metabase, and Superset are particularly strong in handling live API data alongside database queries. They offer built-in connectors or plugins that make API integration seamless.
- **Database Sharing**: In stacks where you have both CMS and data visualization tools (like **Ghost + Superset** or **Next.js + Metabase**), sharing the same database (e.g., PostgreSQL or MySQL) simplifies setup and reduces overhead.
- **Minimalism**: Flat-file CMS options (e.g., **Grav**, **Hugo**, **Jekyll**) keep the CMS lightweight, leaving most of the dynamic work to the data visualization layer (e.g., **Grafana**, **Redash**).
- **API-Ready Visualizations**: Tools like **Grafana** and **Superset** are highly capable of querying external APIs for live data and combining that with local database queries, ensuring your visualizations stay up-to-date.

These stacks allow you to combine static or lightweight CMS options with powerful live data ingestion in the visualization layer, providing the flexibility to merge both local and external data sources seamlessly. Let me know if you need further details on any of these approaches!
