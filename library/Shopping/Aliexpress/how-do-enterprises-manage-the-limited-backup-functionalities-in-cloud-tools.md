# Prompt

As you know I've found it immensely difficult to find a cloud based knowledge management tool that provides any degree of flexibility over the backup approach it offers. In most cases, the only backup functionality availalbe is a user initiated data export which extracts the whole KM at once as text files. From a backup perspective this is inadequate: it's not automated, it's not incremental, and it's not convenient. While I might take backups more seriously than most private users, I wonder how this isn't a huge problem for company and enterprise users. Do they just set up their own tools?

# Output

You're absolutely right, and your observations touch on a significant pain point in knowledge management (KM) systems for **enterprise users**. For individuals and businesses, an inability to have **flexible, reliable, and automated backup solutions** poses risks that could be catastrophic if data is lost or compromised. Let me address why this situation exists and how **enterprise users** typically mitigate these risks.

### Why is Backup Functionality Limited?
1. **Market Focus on Simplicity**: Many **cloud-based KM tools** cater primarily to **private users**, startups, and small businesses. Their focus is on providing an easy-to-use interface rather than deep technical features like automated backups. These companies prioritize **user experience** over advanced data management capabilities because their target market typically doesn’t demand sophisticated backup solutions.

2. **Self-Hosting and Data Control**: For users who care about full **data sovereignty**, the go-to solution is often self-hosting. This allows businesses to integrate **backup processes** into their own IT infrastructure. However, most cloud KM providers prefer not to complicate their services with flexible backup options that only a minority of users would configure. Moreover, more flexible backup methods would require **support** and **infrastructure investment**, which may not align with the business models of such KM providers.

### How Enterprises Handle KM Backups
For **enterprise users**, knowledge management often involves sensitive and mission-critical information. Companies are typically much more risk-averse, so they use different approaches to ensure data resilience. Here’s how they address this gap:

1. **Enterprise-Grade Platforms with Custom Integrations**
   - **Confluence (Data Center Edition)**: Large enterprises typically use platforms like **Confluence Data Center**, which allows for **self-hosting** and provides full control over backup strategies. It can be configured to back up both its content and database incrementally.
   - **SharePoint**: **Microsoft SharePoint** is commonly used by enterprises for document and knowledge management. Since it integrates tightly with **Microsoft Azure**, enterprises often use **Azure Backup** to create incremental and automated backups, managing them based on custom retention policies.
   - **M-Files**: Some companies use platforms like **M-Files**, which provide enterprise-class document management with configurable, incremental backups integrated directly into the IT environment.

2. **Custom Backup Solutions for Self-Hosted KM Systems**
   Enterprises often turn to **self-hosted KM solutions** like **MediaWiki**, **DocuWiki**, or **Confluence Server**. With self-hosting, companies can:
   - Use **database replication** (e.g., **PostgreSQL replication**) to maintain copies of their knowledge databases in real-time.
   - Employ **deduplicated, incremental backups** using tools like **BorgBackup** or **Duplicati** for storage efficiency and regular automated backups.

3. **Third-Party Backup Services and Integration**
   Companies that want to leverage cloud-based KM solutions often resort to **third-party tools** that add backup functionality:
   - **Zapier** or **Integromat** (now **Make**): Automate periodic data exports from KM tools like **Notion**, **ClickUp**, or **Monday.com**. These automations can send data to cloud storage, ensuring that backups are done regularly, although this approach still lacks proper **incremental backup** capabilities.
   - **Backupify**: Tools like **Backupify** offer automated backups of cloud data, including popular KM tools. For instance, Backupify integrates with tools like **Google Workspace** or **Microsoft 365** and automatically takes snapshots of connected documents, giving companies more control over their backup schedules.

4. **API and Data Pipelines**
   Larger organizations often build custom solutions to leverage **APIs**:
   - **Custom Backup Pipelines**: KM tools like **Notion** or **Coda** offer **APIs** that allow developers to write scripts for **incremental data pulls**. By combining these scripts with tools like **AWS S3** or **Google Cloud Storage**, enterprises create their own **incremental and automated backups**.
   - **Integration with ETL Tools**: Enterprise users might leverage **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** tools like **Fivetran**, **Stitch**, or even custom Python scripts to extract data from KM systems at regular intervals and store it in their own **data warehouses**. This approach, though requiring engineering resources, ensures that the data is always in control of the enterprise.

### Why Enterprises Take Their Own Approach
1. **Data Security Concerns**: Enterprises generally have stringent requirements for **data security** and **regulatory compliance**. Relying on a KM provider’s built-in, user-triggered export doesn’t offer the type of redundancy, resilience, and security policies that enterprise-grade IT systems demand.

2. **Regulatory Compliance**: Industries that need to adhere to strict regulations (e.g., **GDPR**, **HIPAA**) require the ability to enforce **backup retention** policies, implement **granular recovery**, and ensure that data remains in a certain jurisdiction. This means relying on tools and services that allow full control of data flows and backups.

3. **Custom Infrastructure Needs**: Enterprises often need backup strategies that fit within their existing IT infrastructure—such as integration with **Active Directory**, **disaster recovery** systems, or specific **cloud architectures**. Many default cloud KM services simply do not offer the flexibility to meet these needs.

### Conclusion: What Do Enterprises Do?
In short, while many KM providers offer limited backup options—typically **manual exports**—enterprise users almost always take matters into their own hands:
- They either **self-host** to have direct control over backups.
- Or they **integrate third-party tools** and build **custom scripts** for automated, incremental backups using **APIs** or **data replication** techniques.

If you're particularly passionate about data sovereignty, even for personal use, taking advantage of **self-hosted KM systems** like **Logseq**, **DokuWiki**, or even **MediaWiki**, paired with a robust backup strategy involving **rsync**, **BorgBackup**, or **Git**, may be the ideal route to go.
