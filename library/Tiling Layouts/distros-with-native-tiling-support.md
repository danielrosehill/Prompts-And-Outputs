Prompt Summary: You are asking if there are any Linux distributions that come with tiling window managers pre-configured out of the box.

Yes, there are several Linux distributions that provide tiling window managers (TWMs) as their default environment or offer pre-configured versions. Here are some popular ones:

1. Regolith Linux

Based On: Ubuntu

Best For: Users who want a tiling environment but still appreciate some graphical configuration tools.


2. Manjaro i3 Edition

Based On: Arch Linux

Tiling WM: i3

Overview: Manjaro offers an official i3 edition that comes pre-configured with a polished i3 setup. It includes additional tools, themes, and utilities to make the tiling experience smoother and more user-friendly.

Best For: Users who want an Arch-based tiling setup without the manual installation process.


3. EndeavourOS

Based On: Arch Linux

Tiling WMs: i3, Sway, BSPWM, Awesome (installable during setup)

Overview: EndeavourOS provides a way to easily install several tiling window managers via its installation process. It includes configurations and scripts to get you up and running quickly with your chosen tiling WM.

4. ArcoLinux

Based On: Arch Linux

Tiling WMs: i3, BSPWM, Awesome, Sway, Qtile, and others

Overview: ArcoLinux is highly modular and offers several editions, including versions with tiling window managers pre-configured. It provides a learning path to get users comfortable with different WMs, including a dedicated “B” series for tiling WMs.

Best For: Users interested in learning different tiling WMs and customizing their experience on an Arch-based distro.


5. Fedora Spin - Fedora i3

Based On: Fedora

Tiling WM: i3

Overview: Fedora offers an official i3 spin that provides a well-configured i3 environment right out of the box. It includes sensible defaults and integrations with Fedora’s system utilities.

7. NixOS with Home Manager

Based On: Independent

Tiling WMs: i3, Sway, Awesome, XMonad, BSPWM, etc. (configurable)

Overview: While not a typical “out-of-the-box” distro, NixOS can be easily set up with various tiling WMs using its declarative configuration system. You can define your environment, and Nix will set it up exactly as specified, including tiling WMs.

Best For: Users who enjoy the idea of reproducible configurations and want fine-grained control over their setup.


8. Pop!_OS (Tiling Extension)

Based On: Ubuntu

Tiling WM: Not a full tiling WM but offers tiling functionality through its GNOME-based desktop

Overview: Pop!_OS comes with a tiling feature built into its GNOME desktop environment. It allows you to automatically tile windows, but it’s not as full-featured as a traditional tiling WM like i3 or Sway.

Best For: Users who want to try tiling without fully committing to a dedicated tiling window manager.


Summary

If you’re looking for a complete out-of-the-box experience with a tiling WM, Regolith, Manjaro i3, and Fedora i3 are great starting points. For those wanting more flexibility, EndeavourOS, ArcoLinux, and Garuda provide options to explore various tiling WMs. NixOS can cater to more advanced users who prefer a declarative, reproducible setup.

Each of these distros helps reduce the setup time and configuration effort by providing pre-configured tiling environments, making it easier to get started. Let me know if you want more details on any of these!
