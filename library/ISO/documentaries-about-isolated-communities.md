# Input

A totally random question unconnected in any way to the foregoing conversation. I've been fascinated my whole life with isolated communities who manage to live far away from society at large in often inhospitable parts of the world. I once watched a documentary about how research scientists on the south pole managed to survive in that place and found it both totally engrossing and quite instructive. I think there's a lot to be learned from people who manage to survive in places where the world around them is limited and they really have the most of the people and resources that they have. I'm a huge documentary fan and was wondering if you might have any recommendations along those lines that I might find interesting? Give me a list of 10 of them to track down!
