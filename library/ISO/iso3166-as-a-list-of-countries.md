# Prompt

How often is ISO3166 updated and who adjudicates upon it?

# Output

The **ISO 3166** standard, specifically ISO 3166-1, which lists country codes, is maintained and updated by the **ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA)**. Here's how the process works and the frequency of updates:

### 1. **Update Frequency**
   - There is no fixed schedule for updates to ISO 3166. Updates are made **as needed** when geopolitical changes occur, such as the creation of new countries, changes in country names, mergers, or dissolutions of states.
   - Updates typically happen in response to significant events like the formation of new states, changes in political status, or the renaming of countries or territories. For example:
     - South Sudan was added to ISO 3166-1 after gaining independence in 2011.
     - North Macedonia’s name change from "Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia" to "North Macedonia" was reflected in ISO 3166.

### 2. **Who Adjudicates?**
   - The **ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA)** is responsible for adjudicating updates to the standard. This agency is composed of members from various international organizations and national standards bodies, ensuring a broad representation of interests.
   
   The **ISO 3166/MA** includes:
   - **International organizations** like the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), Universal Postal Union (UPU), United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), and others.
   - **National standards bodies** from several countries.
   - **Experts** in relevant fields, such as geography, statistics, and international law.

### 3. **Process of Adjudication**
   - **Review and Proposal**: When there is a geopolitical change, such as a new country being created or a name change, the relevant national body or an international organization submits a request to the ISO 3166/MA.
   - **Evaluation**: The ISO 3166/MA evaluates the proposal and the geopolitical situation, ensuring it aligns with the requirements for inclusion, which typically means significant international recognition or substantial regional importance.
   - **Decision**: The agency votes or reaches consensus on the inclusion, modification, or deletion of entries in the list.
   - **Publication**: Once a decision is made, the changes are officially published as part of the ISO 3166-1 updates, and new codes are assigned (or removed) accordingly.

### 4. **Changes in the Standard**
   - Changes are published in the form of **newsletters** or **updates** that inform users of any additions, deletions, or modifications. These newsletters provide details on changes to the country names, code changes (like alpha-2, alpha-3, and numeric codes), and status updates on territories.

   - **Examples of updates**:
     - New countries or changes: For instance, the introduction of **SS** for South Sudan.
     - Name changes: Example, **MK** for North Macedonia after the country’s name change.

### Conclusion
ISO 3166 is updated as needed, primarily in response to geopolitical changes. The updates are overseen and adjudicated by the **ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA)**, which consists of international organizations, national standards bodies, and subject matter experts who evaluate proposals and make decisions based on international consensus.
