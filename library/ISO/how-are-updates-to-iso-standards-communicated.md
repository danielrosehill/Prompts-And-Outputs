# Prompt

Let's say that I want to use ISO3166 in a project. Let's take the example of a Github repository. I would like to be notified when the standard changes and know that I have the latest version. How does this work in practice?

# Output
If you want to use ISO 3166 in a project, like a GitHub repository, and be notified of updates to the standard, you can automate the process of staying up-to-date by leveraging a few strategies. Here’s how it works in practice:

### 1. **Use a Library for ISO 3166**
There are libraries and packages that provide the ISO 3166 country codes, names, and metadata in various programming languages. These libraries are often maintained by the community or organizations and can be easily updated when the standard changes.

Examples of popular libraries:
   - **Python**: [iso3166](https://pypi.org/project/iso3166/)
   - **JavaScript**: [iso-3166-1](https://www.npmjs.com/package/iso-3166-1)
   - **PHP**: [thephpleague/iso3166](https://github.com/thephpleague/iso3166)

These libraries are typically updated by maintainers when there is a change to the ISO 3166 standard. You can subscribe to these repositories (via GitHub notifications or other package management tools) to be alerted of new releases.

#### Workflow:
   - **Monitor the library repository**: 
     - "Watch" the library’s GitHub repository to receive notifications of new commits or releases.
     - Alternatively, you can subscribe to releases or updates via package managers (e.g., npm, PyPI).
   - **Automated updates**: 
     - Use Dependabot (for GitHub) or a similar tool to monitor and automatically create pull requests when the library is updated. Dependabot scans for package updates and automatically notifies you via a PR when new versions are released.

### 2. **Track ISO 3166 Official Updates Directly**
If you prefer to track updates directly from the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA), you can monitor changes through official ISO publications and updates.

#### Workflow:
   - **Subscribe to ISO 3166 Newsletters**: 
     - The ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency publishes updates and changes in the form of newsletters or updates. You can subscribe to the mailing list or monitor the official ISO website.
     - You can also set up an RSS feed for specific parts of the ISO website, or use tools like **Visualping** to monitor the webpage for changes and notify you when a new newsletter is published.

   - **Use a GitHub Action to Monitor Changes**:
     - You can create a custom GitHub Action to monitor the ISO 3166 website or any external source (such as a feed of newsletters). If a change is detected, the action can automatically create an issue or pull request in your repository to review the changes.
     - Example setup:
       - Use GitHub Actions to periodically scrape the ISO website or an API (if available) for updates.
       - Use a workflow that triggers when an update is detected, either by comparing timestamps or checking for new content.
       - Automatically create a pull request or notify you by opening an issue in your GitHub repository.

### 3. **Use a JSON or CSV Dataset of ISO 3166**
There are datasets of ISO 3166 country codes in formats like JSON, CSV, or XML, which are often hosted and regularly updated by third-party organizations or repositories.

#### Workflow:
   - **Find and Fork a Repository**: 
     - Fork a GitHub repository that maintains an ISO 3166 dataset, such as:
       - [lukes/ISO-3166-Countries-with-Regional-Codes](https://github.com/lukes/ISO-3166-Countries-with-Regional-Codes) (a popular dataset with countries and regions).
     - Watch the upstream repository for updates.
   - **Set up Pull Requests**: 
     - If the upstream dataset is updated, you will be notified via GitHub.
     - Use a tool like Dependabot or create a GitHub Action to automate pull requests when the upstream dataset changes.
   - **Monitor Sources**:
     - If the dataset is available via a public API, you can periodically check for updates via a script or a cron job that pulls the latest data and updates your project accordingly.

### 4. **Integrate with an API**
You can integrate your project with APIs that offer up-to-date ISO 3166 country data, which means you wouldn’t need to manually track updates.

#### Examples of APIs:
   - **REST Countries API**: Offers ISO 3166 data along with country information.
     - [https://restcountries.com/](https://restcountries.com/)
   - **ISO Country Codes API**: This specific API is dedicated to ISO country codes and is updated based on official changes.
     - [https://api.printful.com/countries](https://api.printful.com/countries)

#### Workflow:
   - **Integrate API**: Build your project to consume real-time data from an API instead of relying on a static dataset.
   - **Monitor API Changes**: Set up monitoring for API version changes and keep your integration up-to-date.

### 5. **Automate Notifications and Workflow with GitHub**
Use **GitHub Actions** and **webhooks** to automate the process of updating and receiving notifications.

#### Example Setup with GitHub Actions:
   - **Trigger on Updates**: Set up an action that runs on a schedule (e.g., weekly) to fetch the latest ISO 3166 dataset (either from a repository, API, or official source).
   - **Check for Changes**: Compare the fetched dataset with the current version in your project.
   - **Create PR**: If changes are detected, the action can automatically create a pull request with the updates.

### Example YAML for a GitHub Action:

```yaml
name: ISO 3166 Update Check

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * 0' # Run weekly on Sunday
  workflow_dispatch: # Allow manual runs

jobs:
  check_for_updates:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Fetch latest ISO 3166 dataset
        run: |
          curl -o iso3166_latest.json https://example.com/latest_iso3166.json

      - name: Compare with current dataset
        run: |
          diff iso3166_latest.json path/to/your/current_iso3166.json || echo "No updates"

      - name: Create Pull Request if updates found
        if: ${{ steps.compare_with_current_dataset.outputs.changed == 'true' }}
        uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v3
        with:
          commit-message: ISO 3166 Update Detected
          title: "Update ISO 3166 Dataset"
          body: "An update to the ISO 3166 dataset has been detected. This PR includes the latest changes."
          branch: iso3166-update
```

### Conclusion
In practice, automating updates for ISO 3166 in a project can be achieved by leveraging libraries, APIs, and GitHub features like Actions, webhooks, and Dependabot. Monitoring official ISO updates directly is also possible, but most practical projects rely on curated libraries or datasets that are updated by trusted maintainers.
