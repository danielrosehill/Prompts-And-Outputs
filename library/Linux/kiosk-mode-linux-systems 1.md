Yes, there are several options to replicate kiosk mode functionality on Fedora Linux. While there aren’t as many polished kiosk-mode apps as there are on Android, you can achieve similar functionality using the following tools and methods:

1. Webconverger

Features: Webconverger is a Linux distribution designed specifically for kiosk setups. It boots directly into a browser in full-screen (kiosk) mode and restricts user access to other parts of the system. It supports Firefox or Chrome for web-based kiosks.

Best Use Cases: Ideal for information kiosks, digital signage, and customer interaction points.

Remote Management: Can be remotely configured through Webconverger's cloud service, which allows you to update browser settings, homepage, etc.

Installation: You can install Webconverger on Fedora through a live USB or virtual machine.

Price: Free for personal use, with paid cloud-based management services for commercial deployments.


2. Plymouth Kiosk Mode

Features: Plymouth is the graphical boot system for Linux. By configuring it and customizing the desktop environment (e.g., using GNOME or KDE), you can lock Fedora down to kiosk mode. You can force the system to only run a specific application (like a web browser or multimedia app) in full-screen mode without giving access to the rest of the desktop.

Best Use Cases: Public displays, info kiosks, or locked-down workstations.

Remote Management: While there is no built-in remote management, you can control the system remotely through SSH or similar tools.

Installation: Included with Fedora. Configuration requires editing system files and setting up appropriate scripts.

Price: Free.


3. OpenKiosk (Firefox)

Features: OpenKiosk is an add-on for Firefox that converts it into a kiosk browser. It locks the browser into full-screen mode and prevents users from navigating outside specified web pages.

Best Use Cases: Web-based kiosks for retail, public access terminals, or information points.

Remote Management: You can manage the browser’s settings remotely by configuring the Firefox profile or using additional management tools (e.g., Puppet or Ansible).

Installation: Available as a Firefox add-on, which you can install on any Fedora system running Firefox.

Price: Free.


4. Chromium Kiosk Mode

Features: You can run Chromium or Google Chrome in kiosk mode by launching it with specific command-line flags (e.g., chromium --kiosk), which locks it into full-screen mode and restricts navigation.

Best Use Cases: Simple web kiosk setups where a browser is the only application being used.

Remote Management: You can remotely manage the system via SSH, or configure Chromium settings via custom policies or management tools.

Installation: Chromium and Google Chrome are available for installation on Fedora via the package manager.

Price: Free.


5. Xfce or GNOME Kiosk Mode

Features: Both GNOME and Xfce desktop environments can be configured for kiosk mode. By modifying session settings, you can restrict user access to only specific apps or tasks. This setup can lock the system into a specific environment (e.g., only showing a web browser or specific application).

Best Use Cases: Ideal for public terminals, digital signage, or locked-down workstations.

Remote Management: You can configure remote management through tools like Cockpit or SSH to manage the system.

Installation: Both GNOME and Xfce are available in Fedora repositories, and can be configured via system settings.

Price: Free.


6. slock (Simple X display locker)

Features: For simple kiosk setups where you want to lock the system after launching an application in full-screen mode, slock can be used to lock the X display. When configured, it ensures that only authorized users can exit the full-screen app or close it.

Best Use Cases: Public information kiosks or any setup where users should not have access to the desktop environment.

Remote Management: Managed via SSH or by configuring the X session manually.

Installation: Install via Fedora’s package manager (dnf).

Price: Free.


7. Kioware for Linux (Enterprise Option)

Features: Similar to Kioware for Android, Kioware for Linux provides kiosk-mode functionality by restricting the device to a specific application or browser window. It can be customized for commercial applications with touchscreen support, secure lockdown, and remote management.

Best Use Cases: Retail kiosks, transportation hubs, museums, or other public-facing kiosks.

Remote Management: Includes remote management tools, which are perfect for commercial deployments.

Price: Paid, commercial software (contact Kioware for pricing).


Summary of Recommendations:

Webconverger is a good choice if you want a pre-configured Linux system specifically for kiosk use, with remote management options.

OpenKiosk (Firefox) or Chromium Kiosk Mode are ideal for web-based kiosk setups with minimal configuration.

GNOME/Xfce Kiosk Mode is perfect if you need a customizable, full desktop environment with restrictions.

Fully Kiosk Browser or Kioware for Linux are more advanced options with powerful remote management tools for commercial deployments.


These options allow you to tailor Fedora for kiosk environments, whether for public displays, interactive dashboards, or locked-down devices.
