     1. Create the following HTML file:
     ```html
     <!DOCTYPE html>
     <html>
     <head>
         <title>2x2 Grid of Websites</title>
         <style>
             body {
                 margin: 0;
                 display: grid;
                 grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
                 grid-template-rows: 1fr 1fr;
                 height: 100vh;
             }
             iframe {
                 width: 100%;
                 height: 100%;
                 border: none;
             }
         </style>
     </head>
     <body>
         <iframe src="https://www.oref.org.il/eng/alerts-history"></iframe>
         <iframe src="https://www.kan.org.il/live/"></iframe>
         <iframe src="https://video.i24news.tv/live/brightcove/en"></iframe>
         <iframe src="https://www.timesofisrael.com"></iframe>
     </body>
     </html>
     ```
     2. Open the file in any browser.
     3. Save the HTML file locally and bookmark the file in your browser for easy access.
   - **Why it's good**: This approach is fully customizable, and you have complete control over the layout. Once you create the file, you can bookmark it and reuse it anytime.

#### 5. **Tab Resize (Chrome Extension)** (Local Solution)
   - **What it does**: **Tab Resize** is a Chrome extension that lets you arrange your tabs in a grid layout, such as a 2x2 grid.
   - **How to use it**:
     1. Install **[Tab Resize](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tab-resize-split-screen-la/xxxxxxx)** from the Chrome Web Store.
     2. Open the four URLs you want to arrange.
     3. Use the extension to arrange the tabs in a **2x2 grid**.
     4. You can save the session using Chrome’s bookmark manager.
