# Prompt

are there any websites or tools whose entire purpose is to allow you to create grids embedding other websites into them?

# Output

Yes, there are tools that are specifically designed to let you create **grids** or dashboards that can **embed websites** or various types of content within them. These tools allow you to organize multiple sources into a unified view, which is ideal for monitoring or comparing content side by side. Here are some of the most relevant options:

### 1. **Notion**
   - **Notion** is a highly versatile tool that allows you to embed web content within customizable pages. You can create a grid or table-like layout, and embed web pages using iframe embeds or Notion widgets. It’s particularly great for combining notes, websites, and other media into one cohesive dashboard.
   - **Limitations**: Embedding is limited to services that support iframe embeds, and some websites might not work as well if they block iframe embedding.

### 2. **Symbaloo**
   - **Symbaloo** is a tool that allows you to create a grid-based dashboard that you can use to store and quickly access various websites. It’s especially popular in educational contexts for creating curated collections of web links. The visual interface resembles a grid, and each tile links to a different website, which makes it a great option for organizing multiple sources into a unified view.
   - **Pros**: Very easy to set up and highly visual.
   - **Limitations**: Not exactly a full embedding tool, as it mostly provides clickable links rather than live website previews.

### 3. **Miro**
   - **Miro** is a visual collaboration tool that allows you to embed web content onto a large, grid-like canvas. You can create multiple frames that each contain embedded content, including live websites or widgets. This makes it great for creating a grid that is fully interactive.
   - **Pros**: Powerful customization and an easy drag-and-drop interface.
   - **Limitations**: Live embedding of websites may require some integration or come with limited interactions compared to standalone browsers.

### 4. **Walling**
   - **Walling** allows users to create “walls” where each element can be a text, media, or **embedded website**. You can organize the content in a grid-like layout to view everything at a glance.
   - **Pros**: Easy to use, supports different media types, and gives a visual overview.
   - **Limitations**: The interaction with the embedded content might not be as dynamic as with dedicated monitoring tools.

### 5. **Geckoboard**
   - **Geckoboard** is more focused on data dashboards, but it supports embedding a variety of widgets, including custom **iframe embeds**. You can create a grid of widgets that show live content from various sources.
   - **Pros**: Great for creating visual dashboards and combining different content types.
   - **Limitations**: More suited for data visualization, and live website embeds might have limited interactivity.

### 6. **Gridbox.io**
   - **Gridbox.io** is a tool specifically designed for creating grids where each grid box can be used to embed different websites or tools. This type of setup is perfect for monitoring multiple web pages simultaneously.
   - **Pros**: Purpose-built for embedding websites into a grid.
   - **Limitations**: It may have some limitations in handling more complex interactive elements of the embedded websites.

### 7. **PageCloud**
   - **PageCloud** is a website builder that allows you to create custom web pages with embedded content in a grid layout. You can add widgets and iframe-embed websites into your custom page, arranging them in a grid format.
   - **Pros**: Full customization of layout and design, suitable for creating a grid of live content.
   - **Limitations**: Intended more for building websites rather than temporary dashboards.

### 8. **Start.me**
   - **Start.me** is a tool that allows you to create a personal dashboard where you can organize links, widgets, and embeds into a customizable grid. It’s often used as a browser start page for accessing multiple sources at once.
   - **Pros**: Easy to set up and well-suited for managing a collection of embedded websites or links.
   - **Limitations**: May be limited in how interactive the embedded sites are within the grid.

### Summary:
- **Symbaloo** and **Start.me** are simple, easy-to-use tools for creating a **visual grid of website links**.
- **Miro**, **Walling**, and **Geckoboard** allow **dynamic embedding** of content within a grid or canvas.
- **Gridbox.io** and **PageCloud** are more directly suited for embedding live websites into a grid format.

If you're primarily looking for **fully interactive embeds** of websites into a grid, **Gridbox.io** or using a **combination of Notion and iframe embeds** might be the best approach. If you'd like something more ready-made with a drag-and-drop interface, **Miro** could also be a good option.

Would you like to dive deeper into any of these tools, or are you looking for something even more specific?
