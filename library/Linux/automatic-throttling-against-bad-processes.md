# Prompt

I ran a python script on my fedora computer that seemed to run into some sort of error loop. 
It ended up freezing up the whole machine by taking up the entire RAM.
My question is this:
If there's a dramatic surge in RAM consumption from a process beyond a safe limit, it would be great if the OS were able to detect that as aberrant and automatically kill the process before the system froze
Is there any kind of tool like that available and which I could configure?

# Output

Yes, there are several tools and methods available to help prevent system freezes due to excessive RAM consumption by a single process. Here are some options you can consider:

## systemd-oomd

systemd-oomd is an out-of-memory (OOM) killer daemon that comes built-in with modern versions of systemd[1]. It's designed to detect and respond to memory pressure before the system becomes completely unresponsive.

To enable and start systemd-oomd on Fedora, you can use the following commands:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now systemd-oomd
```

## earlyoom

earlyoom is another popular OOM killer that can be installed separately[1]. It's designed to intervene earlier than the kernel's built-in OOM killer, potentially preventing system freezes.

To install and enable earlyoom on Fedora:

```bash
sudo dnf install earlyoom
sudo systemctl enable --now earlyoom
```

## Configuring Resource Limits

You can set resource limits for processes using the `ulimit` command or by editing `/etc/security/limits.conf`[4]. This can prevent a single process from consuming all available memory.

## Monitoring and Killing Processes

You can also set up a custom script that monitors memory usage and kills processes that exceed a certain threshold. Tools like `top` or `ps` can be used to gather memory usage information[3].

## Kernel OOM Killer Settings

While not as proactive as the above solutions, you can also tweak the kernel's OOM killer settings to make it more aggressive in killing memory-hogging processes[2].

## Recommendations

1. **Enable systemd-oomd**: This is a built-in solution on modern Fedora systems and is a good first step.

2. **Install earlyoom**: This provides an additional layer of protection and is easy to set up.

3. **Set resource limits**: This can prevent runaway processes from consuming all system resources.

4. **Consider increasing swap space**: While not a direct solution, having more swap can give you more time to react before the system becomes unresponsive.

Remember, while these tools can help prevent system freezes, they're not foolproof. It's always a good practice to save your work frequently and monitor system resources when running resource-intensive scripts or applications.

# Input

There might be a built in killer, but clearly in this instance it failed. So I'd definitely like something more robust. Is there anything similar to protect against CPU spikes? What's the most advanced?

# Output

Based on your experience and the need for a more robust solution, let's explore some advanced options for managing both RAM and CPU usage:

## Process Lasso

Process Lasso is one of the most advanced tools available for managing system resources, particularly for CPU optimization and automation[1]. While it's primarily designed for Windows, its features are relevant to your needs:

- **ProBalance Algorithm**: Helps maintain system responsiveness during high CPU loads by dynamically adjusting process priorities.
- **CPU Affinity Control**: Allows you to specify which CPU cores a process can use, potentially limiting its impact.
- **Watchdog Rules**: You can create custom rules to take action when certain thresholds are reached.
- **Instance Balancing**: Manages multiple instances of processes to prevent overload.

## Workspace Environment Management (WEM)

While primarily used in Citrix environments, WEM offers sophisticated CPU management features[4][5]:

- **CPU Spike Protection**: Automatically reduces CPU priority of processes that overload the CPU.
- **Intelligent CPU Optimization**: Optimizes new instances of processes that have previously caused spikes.
- **CPU Core Usage Limit**: Restricts processes triggering CPU spike protection to a specified number of logical processors.
- **Intelligent I/O Optimization**: Adjusts I/O priority for processes that repeatedly trigger CPU spike protection.

## Custom Solutions

For a Linux-based system like Fedora, you might consider creating a custom solution using existing tools:

1. **cgroups (Control Groups)**: Use cgroups to set resource limits for processes or groups of processes.

2. **systemd Slices**: Utilize systemd slices to manage resource allocation for groups of processes.

3. **Custom Monitoring Script**: Create a script that uses tools like `ps`, `top`, or `htop` to monitor resource usage and take action when thresholds are exceeded.

4. **Kernel Parameters**: Adjust kernel parameters like `vm.oom_kill_allocating_task` to make the OOM killer more aggressive.

## Recommendations

1. **Implement Process Lasso-like functionality**: While Process Lasso itself is Windows-only, you could create a similar system for Fedora using a combination of cgroups, systemd, and custom scripts.

2. **Develop a custom monitoring daemon**: Create a service that continuously monitors both RAM and CPU usage, with configurable thresholds and actions.

3. **Use predictive analysis**: Implement a system that learns from past behavior to predict and prevent resource spikes before they occur.

4. **Combine multiple approaches**: Use a layered approach with kernel-level controls (like cgroups), system services (like systemd), and user-space monitoring tools for comprehensive protection.

5. **Consider containerization**: For critical or resource-intensive applications, consider running them in containers with strict resource limits.

While there's no single off-the-shelf solution that perfectly matches your needs for Fedora, combining these approaches can create a robust system to prevent both RAM and CPU spikes from freezing your system. The key is to create a solution that's proactive, configurable, and able to take decisive action before the system becomes unresponsive.

# Input

You're right that there are indeed tools available for Linux systems to manage CPU and RAM usage without resorting to custom scripting. Here are some existing solutions that could help address your needs:

1. cgroups (Control Groups):
cgroups is a Linux kernel feature that allows you to limit, prioritize, and allocate system resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O, network, etc.) among user-defined groups of processes[4]. It's built into the Linux kernel and can be managed using tools like systemd.

2. systemd-oomd:
This is an out-of-memory (OOM) killer daemon that comes built-in with modern versions of systemd. It's designed to detect and respond to memory pressure before the system becomes completely unresponsive[6].

3. earlyoom:
earlyoom is a userspace out-of-memory (OOM) killer that can intervene earlier than the kernel's built-in OOM killer, potentially preventing system freezes[6].

4. cpulimit:
cpulimit is a tool that restricts the CPU usage of a process (expressed in percentage, not in CPU time)[7]. It can help prevent a single process from consuming too much CPU.

5. nohang:
nohang is a sophisticated OOM prevention and recovery tool. It can monitor both RAM and swap usage, and take action before the system becomes unresponsive[7].

6. Ananicy:
Ananicy is an auto nice daemon that automatically adjusts the nice levels (CPU priority) of processes based on predefined rules[7].

7. Process Lasso (for Windows, but conceptually relevant):
While not available for Linux, Process Lasso's features like ProBalance (which dynamically adjusts process priorities) and CPU affinity management showcase the kind of advanced process management that's possible[8]. Similar functionality can be achieved on Linux using a combination of the above tools and kernel features.

These tools can help manage both CPU spikes and memory usage without the need for custom scripting. They leverage built-in Linux kernel features and provide more robust solutions than simple scripts. You can configure these tools to automatically intervene when resource usage exceeds certain thresholds, helping to maintain system responsiveness even under high load conditions.

# Input

Do any of these have GUIs or something close to it?

# Output

Based on the search results, a few of the tools mentioned do have graphical user interfaces (GUIs) or something close to it:

1. System Monitor Tool: This is a built-in GUI tool for Fedora and other Linux distributions that use GNOME. It allows you to view, search for, change the priority of, and kill processes from a graphical interface. It also shows CPU, memory, and disk usage graphically [8].

2. CGroup Manager GUI: This is a project aimed at providing an easy method of interacting with and managing cgroups on Linux systems through a graphical interface. It's specifically targeted at Fedora 24 but can be expanded to other Linux distributions [7].

3. CpuPower-GUI: This is a graphical tool for managing CPU power and performance settings. It provides a user-friendly interface to adjust CPU governor settings, core speeds, and create custom profiles [10].

4. Nohang: While not strictly a GUI tool, Nohang can be configured to show GUI notifications about low memory conditions and actions taken to prevent out-of-memory situations [9].

5. earlyoom: Similar to Nohang, earlyoom itself doesn't have a GUI, but it can be configured to send desktop notifications when it takes action to prevent out-of-memory situations [1].

Among these, the System Monitor Tool and CpuPower-GUI are likely the most user-friendly options for monitoring and managing system resources through a graphical interface. The System Monitor Tool comes pre-installed on many Linux distributions, while CpuPower-GUI would need to be installed separately.
