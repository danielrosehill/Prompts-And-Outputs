To set up a shortcut in **Fedora Linux** that automatically types `"find more"` and then hits return, you'll need to use **AutoKey**, a text automation tool for Linux that allows you to create scripts and assign them to keyboard shortcuts. Here's a step-by-step guide to achieve that:

### Step 1: Install AutoKey
1. Open a terminal.
2. Install AutoKey using the following command:
   ```bash
   sudo dnf install autokey-gtk
   ```
   For KDE, you can use `autokey-qt` instead of `autokey-gtk`.

### Step 2: Launch AutoKey
1. Open **AutoKey** by searching for it in your applications or by typing `autokey-gtk` in the terminal.
2. AutoKey will run in the system tray.

### Step 3: Create a New Script
1. In AutoKey, right-click on **My Phrases** in the left sidebar and choose **New Script**.
2. Name your script (e.g., `"Find More Shortcut"`).

### Step 4: Enter the Script
1. In the main editor window, type the following AutoKey script:
   ```python
   keyboard.send_keys('find more\n')
   ```
   This script will type `find more` and hit the return key (`\n`).

### Step 5: Set a Shortcut Key
1. Under the **Set Shortcut** section, click on **Set** to assign a keyboard shortcut.
2. Press the desired shortcut combination (e.g., `Ctrl + Alt + F`).
3. Click **OK** to save the shortcut.

### Step 6: Save and Test
1. Click **Save** to apply the script.
2. Test the shortcut in any text field or terminal window. Press the keyboard shortcut you assigned, and it should type `"find more"` followed by a return.

This method will automate typing and pressing "return" using a simple script on Fedora Linux.

If **AutoKey** isn't working well for your needs, another great option for automating text input and shortcuts on **Fedora Linux** is using **xdotool** in combination with custom keyboard shortcuts. This tool allows you to simulate keyboard input, including typing text and pressing keys like "Enter."

Hereâ€™s how you can set up a shortcut to type `"find more"` and hit return using **xdotool**:

### Step 1: Install xdotool
1. Open a terminal and install xdotool by running:
   ```bash
   sudo dnf install xdotool
   ```

### Step 2: Create a Script to Type "find more" and Press Return
1. In your home directory, create a simple script that uses xdotool to type `"find more"` and hit the return key.
   
2. Open a terminal and create a new script file:
   ```bash
   nano ~/find_more.sh
   ```

3. Add the following content to the script:
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   xdotool type "find more"
   xdotool key Return
   ```

4. Save the file by pressing `Ctrl + O`, then press `Enter`, and exit with `Ctrl + X`.

### Step 3: Make the Script Executable
1. To make the script executable, run the following command:
   ```bash
   chmod +x ~/find_more.sh
   ```

### Step 4: Set Up a Keyboard Shortcut
Now that you have the script, you can set up a custom keyboard shortcut in Fedora to run this script.

1. Open **Settings** and navigate to **Keyboard**.
2. Scroll down to the bottom and click **+** to add a custom shortcut.
3. In the **Name** field, type something like `"Find More Shortcut"`.
4. In the **Command** field, enter the full path to the script:
   ```bash
   /home/your-username/find_more.sh
   ```
5. Click **Set Shortcut**, then press the key combination you want to use (e.g., `Ctrl + Alt + F`).

### Step 5: Test the Shortcut
1. After setting the shortcut, open any text field or terminal and press the key combination you chose. It should type `"find more"` and then hit the return key automatically.

This method uses **xdotool** to simulate typing and pressing keys, and it works well with custom keyboard shortcuts in Fedora. Let me know if you need further assistance!
