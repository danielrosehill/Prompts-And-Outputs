Please go through all of these solutions and state how I would go about deploying them on my workstation OS of Fedora

I apologize for the confusion in my previous response. You're right to focus on managed platforms for hosting a remote Ansible server, as this aligns with your desire to avoid setting up your own infrastructure. Here are some managed platforms that could host a remote Ansible server for you:

1. **Ansible Tower as a Service (AWX-as-a-Service)**
   While not an official Red Hat product, some third-party providers offer AWX (the open-source version of Ansible Tower) as a managed service.

   **Pros:**
   - Fully managed solution
   - Web-based interface for managing Ansible playbooks
   - No infrastructure to maintain

   **Cons:**
   - Limited providers available
   - May lack some features of the full Ansible Tower

2. **AWS Systems Manager**
   While not strictly an Ansible platform, AWS Systems Manager can run Ansible playbooks as part of its Automation feature.

   **Pros:**
   - Integrated with AWS ecosystem
   - Can run Ansible playbooks without maintaining a separate server
   - Pay-per-use pricing

   **Cons:**
   - Requires AWS knowledge
   - Not a full Ansible Tower replacement

3. **Azure Automation**
   Similar to AWS Systems Manager, Azure Automation can run Ansible playbooks.

   **Pros:**
   - Integrated with Azure ecosystem
   - Can run Ansible playbooks in a managed environment
   - Pay-per-use pricing

   **Cons:**
   - Requires Azure knowledge
   - Not a full Ansible Tower replacement

4. **Google Cloud's Ansible-managed nodes**
   While not a full Ansible server, Google Cloud offers Ansible-managed node functionality.

   **Pros:**
   - Integrated with Google Cloud
   - Simplifies management of Google Cloud resources with Ansible

   **Cons:**
   - Limited to Google Cloud resources
   - Not a full Ansible server solution

5. **Managed Ansible Services from Cloud Providers**
   Some cloud consulting firms and managed service providers offer managed Ansible services, which could include hosting and maintaining an Ansible server for you.

   **Pros:**
   - Fully managed solution
   - Expert support

   **Cons:**
   - Can be more expensive
   - May require a long-term contract

For your use case of managing configurations between a desktop and a laptop, these managed solutions might be more complex than necessary. A simpler approach could be to use Ansible in a "pull" configuration:

1. Store your Ansible playbooks in a Git repository (like GitHub or GitLab).
2. Set up a cron job on both your desktop and laptop to periodically run `ansible-pull`, which will fetch and apply the latest configuration from your Git repository.

This approach doesn't require a dedicated Ansible server but still allows you to manage configurations across multiple machines. It's lightweight, doesn't incur additional costs, and doesn't require maintaining extra infrastructure.
