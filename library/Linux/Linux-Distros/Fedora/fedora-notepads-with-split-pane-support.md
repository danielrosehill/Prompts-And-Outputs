# Prompt

Are there any notepads for Fedora that have split pane support so that I could work on a few notes simultaneously?

# Output

For simple notepads on Fedora that support **split pane functionality** (useful for jotting down text notes), here are some excellent options:

### 1. **Gedit (with Plugins)**
   - **What it is**: Gedit is the default GNOME text editor, lightweight and designed for simplicity, but can be extended with plugins to enable more advanced functionality like split panes.
   - **How to enable split panes**: Install the **Multi-Edit plugin** using the Gedit Plugins package. This will allow you to split the editor into multiple panes to view or edit different files simultaneously.
   - **Installation**:
     ```bash
     sudo dnf install gedit-plugins
     ```
   - **Why it's great**: Itâ€™s lightweight, fast, and integrates well with the GNOME desktop.

### 2. **Notepadqq**
   - **What it is**: Notepadqq is a **Linux alternative to Notepad++**, designed for jotting down text notes and supporting basic development tasks.
   - **How to enable split panes**: Notepadqq supports split panes natively. You can split the editor both vertically and horizontally to work on multiple text files simultaneously.
   - **Installation**:
     ```bash
     sudo dnf install notepadqq
     ```
   - **Why it's great**: It's simple to use, similar to Notepad++, and has built-in split screen support for multitasking across different notes.

### 3. **Kate (KDE Text Editor)**
   - **What it is**: **Kate** is the advanced text editor for the KDE desktop, designed for text editing but also powerful enough to handle multiple documents at once through split panes.
   - **How to enable split panes**: In Kate, you can split the view horizontally or vertically using the "Split View" option under the `View` menu.
   - **Installation**:
     ```bash
     sudo dnf install kate
     ```
   - **Why it's great**: Kate is highly customizable and allows for flexible pane layouts, making it great for jotting down multiple notes at the same time.

### 4. **Xed (Text Editor)**
   - **What it is**: **Xed** is a simple text editor based on **Pluma** and **Gedit**. It provides a clean interface for taking text notes and can be extended with plugins to support split panes.
   - **How to enable split panes**: Use the Multi-Edit plugin to enable split panes.
   - **Installation**:
     ```bash
     sudo dnf install xed
     ```
   - **Why it's great**: Xed is lightweight, user-friendly, and a good option for taking simple notes with the potential for multi-pane views.

### Summary:
If you're looking for **simple notepads** that support split-pane layouts:
- **Notepadqq** and **Gedit (with Plugins)** are great lightweight options.
- **Kate** offers more flexibility if you prefer working in a more powerful text editor environment with built-in split functionality.
