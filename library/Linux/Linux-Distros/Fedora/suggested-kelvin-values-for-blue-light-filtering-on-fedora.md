# Prompt

Could you also give me some guidelines for the color temperature setting on my Fedora Linux computer? What are some good values to use at different times of the day? I'm trying to avoid on minimal blue light exposure at night time as you know

# Output

To help you reduce blue light exposure, it's a good idea to adjust your **color temperature** throughout the day to maintain productivity in the daytime and prepare for restful sleep at night. Here are some **recommended color temperature values** for your Fedora Linux computer during different times of the day:

### **Color Temperature Guidelines for Different Times of the Day**

1. **Morning to Mid-Afternoon (7 AM - 3 PM)**
   - **Color Temperature**: **5500K - 6500K**
   - **Reason**: During the morning and early afternoon, you want to emulate **natural daylight**, which contains a lot of blue light and helps you stay alert and productive. Setting the color temperature to around **5500K to 6500K** (often referred to as "cool white" or "daylight") helps keep your energy levels up.
   - **How It Looks**: This is a bright, slightly bluish-white light that mimics daylight, supporting focus and productivity.

2. **Late Afternoon (3 PM - 6 PM)**
   - **Color Temperature**: **4000K - 5000K**
   - **Reason**: As the day progresses, it’s good to start reducing blue light exposure. A **neutral white** light around **4000K to 5000K** is still bright enough to keep you focused but helps your body prepare for a more relaxed evening.
   - **How It Looks**: This setting is a **neutral white** light—neither too warm nor too cool—that still maintains productivity while gradually reducing blue light.

3. **Evening (6 PM - 9 PM)**
   - **Color Temperature**: **3000K - 3500K**
   - **Reason**: By the early evening, it’s best to switch to a **warmer white** light, closer to **3000K - 3500K**. This temperature mimics indoor incandescent lighting, which helps reduce overall stimulation and signals to your body that the day is winding down.
   - **How It Looks**: This light appears slightly yellowish, more like the traditional incandescent light bulbs you’d use at home in the evening, creating a cozy atmosphere.

4. **Late Night (After 9 PM)**
   - **Color Temperature**: **1800K - 2700K**
   - **Reason**: At night, you want to **minimize blue light** exposure entirely to avoid interfering with **melatonin production**. Setting the temperature to between **1800K and 2700K** provides a warm, almost reddish light, which is ideal for reducing strain on your eyes and allowing your body to naturally prepare for sleep.
   - **How It Looks**: This is a **very warm amber or orange hue**, similar to candlelight, which minimizes blue light content and helps you relax before bed.

### **Tools for Adjusting Color Temperature on Fedora Linux**
To implement these changes easily on your Fedora Linux system, you can use tools designed to adjust the **color temperature** automatically:

1. **Redshift**:
   - **Redshift** is a popular open-source tool that adjusts your display color temperature based on the time of day. You can set different temperatures for daytime and night, and it will adjust them automatically as the sun sets and rises.
   - You can configure Redshift with these settings:
     - **Daytime Temperature**: **6000K**
     - **Night Temperature**: **2500K** for minimal blue light.

   Command example to run Redshift:
   ```bash
   redshift -t 6500:2500
   ```
   This command sets a daytime temperature of **6500K** and a nighttime temperature of **2500K**.

2. **GNOME Night Light** (if you use GNOME on Fedora):
   - **GNOME Night Light** is built into the GNOME desktop environment. It allows you to set color temperatures and schedules for reducing blue light.
   - You can access it by going to **Settings** > **Displays** > **Night Light** and configure the **temperature slider**.
   - Set the slider to **minimum** (about **1800K - 2700K**) for nighttime use.

3. **f.lux (Alternative Option)**:
   - If you prefer **f.lux**, it also supports Linux and provides automated color temperature adjustments.
   - f.lux can automatically adjust based on your geographic location and will transition gradually throughout the day, similar to Redshift.

### **Summary of Suggested Color Temperature Schedule**
- **Morning to Mid-Afternoon (7 AM - 3 PM)**: **5500K - 6500K** (Cool white, productive light)
- **Late Afternoon (3 PM - 6 PM)**: **4000K - 5000K** (Neutral white, reducing blue light)
- **Evening (6 PM - 9 PM)**: **3000K - 3500K** (Warm white, preparing for evening)
- **Late Night (After 9 PM)**: **1800K - 2700K** (Amber or reddish light, minimal blue light)

These settings will help regulate your blue light exposure throughout the day, keeping you alert during working hours while promoting relaxation and better sleep quality at night. Let me know if you need help with configuring these tools or if you want additional recommendations!
