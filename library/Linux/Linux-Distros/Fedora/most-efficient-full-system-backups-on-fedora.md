# Prompt

What's the most efficient way to take a full system backup of a fedora OS computer onto an external SSD? The Fedora computer I wish to backup is running BTRFS and RAID 1 (RAID 1 is spready over 3 physical disks)

# Output

**Prompt Summary:** You asked for the most efficient way to take a full system backup of a Fedora OS computer onto an external SSD, noting that the system uses Btrfs with RAID 1 across three physical disks.

Given your setup, Btrfs has built-in tools that can make backing up your system more efficient, especially since it's designed to handle snapshots and multi-device configurations like RAID. Here are a few approaches:

### 1. **Using Btrfs Snapshots and Send/Receive**
   - **Method:** Leverage Btrfs snapshots and the `btrfs send`/`btrfs receive` commands. This method efficiently transfers data by only copying the changes between snapshots.
   - **Steps:**
     1. Create a snapshot of the Btrfs subvolumes you wish to back up:
        ```bash
        sudo btrfs subvolume snapshot -r / /mnt/btrfs-backups/root_snapshot
        ```
     2. Use `btrfs send` to send the snapshot to the external SSD:
        ```bash
        sudo btrfs send /mnt/btrfs-backups/root_snapshot | sudo btrfs receive /path/to/external-ssd/
        ```
     3. For incremental backups (sending only changes since the last snapshot), create a new snapshot and run:
        ```bash
        sudo btrfs send -p /mnt/btrfs-backups/root_snapshot /mnt/btrfs-backups/root_snapshot_new | sudo btrfs receive /path/to/external-ssd/
        ```
   - **Pros:** Efficient use of space, fast incremental backups, native handling of Btrfs features (RAID, snapshots).
   - **Cons:** Requires familiarity with Btrfs commands.

### 2. **Using `btrfs-image` for a Disk Image**
   - **Method:** `btrfs-image` can create an image of the Btrfs filesystem, useful for full-system backups.
   - **Command Example:**
     ```bash
     sudo btrfs-image -c9 /dev/sdX /path/to/external-ssd/system-backup.img
     ```
   - **Options Explained:**
     - `-c9`: Compression level (adjust for speed vs. compression trade-off).
   - **Pros:** Efficient disk image backup, preserves all Btrfs features.
   - **Cons:** Full disk restoration can be more manual, and the process can be slow for large filesystems.

### 3. **Using `rsync` with Btrfs Snapshots**
   - **Method:** Combine Btrfs snapshots with `rsync` for incremental file-based backups.
   - **Steps:**
     1. Create a snapshot:
        ```bash
        sudo btrfs subvolume snapshot -r / /mnt/btrfs-backups/root_snapshot
        ```
     2. Use `rsync` to copy the snapshot:
        ```bash
        sudo rsync -aAXv /mnt/btrfs-backups/root_snapshot/ /path/to/external-ssd/
        ```
   - **Pros:** Versatile, supports incremental backups, preserves permissions.
   - **Cons:** Slightly more manual, may need extra steps to restore bootloader.

### Recommendations:
Given your RAID 1 setup on Btrfs, the **Btrfs `send`/`receive`** method is likely the most efficient and effective, especially for managing incremental backups. It allows you to take advantage of Btrfsâ€™s built-in capabilities, making the process faster and less resource-intensive.
