**Prompt Summary:** You asked about somewhat obscure and futuristic gesture control devices that would be compatible with Fedora Linux.

### Gesture Control Devices Compatible with Fedora Linux

There are a few interesting and futuristic gesture control devices, some of which may not be very well-known but can be used with Linux systems, including Fedora. Compatibility often depends on available drivers, SDKs, and open-source community support. Here are some intriguing options:

### 1. **Leap Motion Controller**
   - **Description:** Leap Motion is a small USB device that tracks hand and finger motions with incredible precision, allowing you to control your computer with gestures. It creates a 3D interaction space in front of your screen, recognizing various hand movements.
   - **Compatibility with Fedora:**
     - While official support is primarily for Windows and macOS, there is **Linux support** via open-source drivers and community projects.
     - You can use `leapd`, the Linux daemon for Leap Motion, to connect it to Fedora. Some users have reported success with running it on modern Linux systems, though it may require tweaking.
   - **Use Cases:** Gesture control for virtual reality, creative applications, desktop navigation, and custom gesture-based controls.
   - **Links:** [Leap Motion on GitHub](https://github.com/Ultraleap/)

### 2. **MYO Armband**
   - **Description:** The MYO Armband is a wearable gesture control device that reads the electrical activity of your arm muscles. It can detect specific hand gestures and translate them into commands for your computer, making it quite futuristic.
   - **Compatibility with Fedora:**
     - The company behind MYO (Thalmic Labs) discontinued the product, but Linux enthusiasts have created **open-source projects** to interface with the device.
     - Projects like `myo-raw` and `myo-linux` can be used to connect the armband to Linux systems, though the setup may be somewhat experimental.
   - **Use Cases:** Hands-free control for presentations, gaming, controlling music or video playback, and VR/AR applications.
   - **Links:** [Myo Armband GitHub Projects](https://github.com/dzhu/myo-raw)

### 3. **Geco MIDI (Using Leap Motion)**
   - **Description:** Geco MIDI is a software that allows you to use Leap Motion as a MIDI controller, making it an interesting gesture-based interface for music production. While it’s primarily a software solution, it highlights how the Leap Motion device can be used creatively.
   - **Compatibility with Fedora:**
     - Since Leap Motion can be used on Linux, you can adapt Geco MIDI functionality or similar tools to control applications or even manipulate sounds on Fedora.
   - **Use Cases:** Gesture-based music production, audio manipulation, and live performances.

### 4. **Bitalino (Bio-Signal Based Gestures)**
   - **Description:** Bitalino is a versatile biosignal acquisition device that can be used to capture muscle signals (EMG), heartbeat (ECG), and other bio-signals. With some creativity, it can be adapted for gesture control by interpreting muscle activity.
   - **Compatibility with Fedora:**
     - Bitalino has Linux support through open-source libraries, making it compatible with Fedora. You can write scripts to interpret bio-signals and create custom gesture-based interactions.
   - **Use Cases:** Experimental gesture controls, research projects, health monitoring, or creating unique bio-signal-based user interfaces.
   - **Links:** [Bitalino Python SDK](https://pypi.org/project/bitalino/)

### 5. **Hoversurf Hover Gesture Control**
   - **Description:** Hoversurf is a futuristic device that uses ultrasonic waves to create a floating, interactive button that you can press mid-air. It detects where your hand is and allows you to interact without physical touch.
   - **Compatibility with Fedora:**
     - Limited Linux compatibility officially, but open-source projects and custom integrations can be developed to connect it with Fedora systems.
   - **Use Cases:** Hands-free, touchless control in sterile environments, custom gesture-based interfaces for specific applications.

### 6. **Sony's Toio Platform (Hackable for Gesture Control)**
   - **Description:** Sony Toio is a platform for building interactive experiences, primarily designed for children’s robotics. However, hackers have found ways to use its sensors and motion capabilities to create gesture-based controls.
   - **Compatibility with Fedora:**
     - Open-source SDKs exist, and with some programming effort, you could connect it to a Fedora system to act as a gesture input device. 
   - **Use Cases:** Robotics control, gesture-based navigation, experimental projects.

### 7. **OpenBCI (Brainwave and Muscle Input)**
   - **Description:** OpenBCI is an open-source platform for brain-computer interfacing. Though primarily focused on EEG, it also has EMG (muscle signals) capabilities, which means you could use it to detect certain gestures or muscle movements and trigger commands.
   - **Compatibility with Fedora:**
     - The OpenBCI ecosystem is highly compatible with Linux, and there are many community-created tools to integrate with different operating systems, including Fedora.
   - **Use Cases:** Brainwave or muscle-signal-based controls, experimental projects, accessibility solutions.

### Conclusion
There are several futuristic and experimental gesture control devices that can be made to work with Fedora Linux, either directly through community support or by leveraging open-source tools and SDKs. **Leap Motion** and **MYO Armband** are two of the most interesting, with existing projects that make integration feasible. Other options like **Bitalino** and **OpenBCI** offer a more experimental approach, using biosignals to create custom gesture-based controls. While some devices may require more setup and programming, the open-source community often provides workarounds and drivers to make these futuristic devices compatible with Linux systems.
