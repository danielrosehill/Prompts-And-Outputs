You can find out the network IP address of your printer on Fedora by using a few different methods. Here are some effective ways to determine the printer’s IP address:

### 1. **Check Printer Settings on the Printer Display**
If your HP DeskJet 5200 series has a display panel, you can typically navigate through the settings to find network information.

- **Steps**: On your printer, go to **Settings > Network Settings > Wireless Summary** or **Network Information**, and you should see the IP address listed.

### 2. **CUPS Web Interface**
The **CUPS** (Common Unix Printing System) web interface is useful for viewing and managing connected printers:

1. **Access CUPS**:
   - Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:631](http://localhost:631) to open the CUPS management page.

2. **Check Printer Information**:
   - Go to **Printers**.
   - Select your printer, and it should display the **device URI** or other network information, which often includes the IP address.

### 3. **Use `nmap` to Scan Your Network**
You can use `nmap` to scan your network for devices and locate the printer’s IP:

1. **Install `nmap`** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   sudo dnf install nmap
   ```

2. **Scan Your Network**:
   Assuming your network is in the `192.168.1.x` range, you can scan all devices with:
   ```bash
   nmap -sP 192.168.1.0/24
   ```
   Look for a device labeled with something related to HP or a recognizable name. It will show the IP address of the detected devices.

### 4. **Check Router's Web Interface**
Your router's web interface will display a list of connected devices along with their IP addresses:

1. **Access Router**: Log in to your router's configuration page (usually at `http://192.168.1.1` or `http://192.168.1.1`).
2. **View Connected Devices**: Navigate to the section that lists **connected devices** or **DHCP clients**.
3. **Find Printer**: Look for your printer in the list. It should be labeled as "HP DeskJet" or something similar.

### 5. **Using `lpstat` Command**
You can use the `lpstat` command to get information on printers detected by CUPS, which may include the network address:

```bash
lpstat -v
```
This command lists all printers and their device URIs. If the printer is connected via the network, the URI should include an IP address or hostname, e.g., `ipp://192.168.1.100/...`.

### 6. **Use `avahi-browse` for Network Discovery**
The `avahi-browse` command can help you locate devices on the local network that use mDNS (Multicast DNS), which includes many network printers:

1. **Install `avahi-utils`**:
   ```bash
   sudo dnf install avahi
   ```

2. **Discover Printers on the Network**:
   ```bash
   avahi-browse -a | grep -i "printer"
   ```
   This command will list all printers detected via mDNS, which often includes the IP address.

### Summary:
- **On the Printer**: Check the printer’s control panel or screen for network information.
- **CUPS Interface**: Visit [http://localhost:631](http://localhost:631) and navigate to **Printers**.
- **Network Scan (`nmap`)**: Use `nmap` to scan your local network.
- **Router Interface**: Check your router for connected devices.
- **`lpstat` or `avahi-browse`**: Use terminal commands to get printer information.

These methods will help you determine the network IP address of the printer. Let me know if you need further assistance!
