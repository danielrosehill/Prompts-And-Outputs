Here are some graph-related tools that work well on Fedora Linux for knowledge management, data visualization, and exploration:

### 1. **Neo4j Desktop and Neo4j Community Edition**
   - **Purpose**: Full-featured graph database for storing, querying, and visualizing graph data.
   - **Installation**: Neo4j Desktop isn’t natively supported on Linux, but you can install **Neo4j Community Edition** directly on Fedora via a Docker image or by downloading it from the Neo4j website.
   - **Features**: Supports Cypher queries, visualizations, and plugins. The community edition works well for local, smaller-scale projects.

### 2. **Obsidian with Graph View Plugin**
   - **Purpose**: Markdown-based personal knowledge manager with a graph view to explore notes and relationships.
   - **Installation**: Download the AppImage from Obsidian’s website and run it directly on Fedora.
   - **Features**: Graph view shows linked notes, allowing for a basic knowledge graph setup that works offline.

### 3. **Logseq**
   - **Purpose**: Open-source knowledge management tool with networked linking and a graph-based interface.
   - **Installation**: Download the AppImage from the Logseq website, which runs smoothly on Fedora.
   - **Features**: Similar to Obsidian but with bidirectional links and visual graphs to represent connections between notes.

### 4. **Dgraph**
   - **Purpose**: An open-source, distributed graph database suitable for larger projects with support for GraphQL.
   - **Installation**: Install Dgraph using Docker on Fedora. Alternatively, you can download precompiled binaries from the Dgraph website.
   - **Features**: Supports both GraphQL and DQL (Dgraph Query Language) for flexible data querying, making it ideal for more advanced, cloud-friendly graph applications.

### 5. **Gephi**
   - **Purpose**: Open-source graph visualization tool suitable for exploring complex graph data.
   - **Installation**: Install using `dnf install gephi` or download from the Gephi website (it runs on Java, so make sure Java is installed).
   - **Features**: Ideal for visualizing and analyzing graph data, with built-in metrics for measuring centrality, clustering, and network density.

### 6. **Gource**
   - **Purpose**: Visualize version control history as an animated graph, ideal for projects with Git repositories.
   - **Installation**: Available in Fedora’s repository, install with `sudo dnf install gource`.
   - **Features**: Animates commit history as a graph, making it great for visualizing project evolution over time.

### 7. **NetworkX (Python Library)**
   - **Purpose**: Python library for creating, analyzing, and visualizing graphs, especially useful for custom or programmatic analysis.
   - **Installation**: Install using `pip install networkx`.
   - **Features**: Provides extensive graph algorithms and is highly customizable for various graph-related projects, ideal for script-based analysis or data science applications.

### 8. **Vis.js (JavaScript Library)**
   - **Purpose**: A JavaScript library for creating and interacting with dynamic, browser-based graph visualizations.
   - **Installation**: Use in web development with Node.js or serve locally in a browser.
   - **Features**: If you’re considering developing a frontend for your graph data, Vis.js can render interactive graphs that integrate well with Neo4j and other databases.

These tools should give you a broad range of options for graph-based exploration, storage, and visualization on Fedora Linux. For database-backed projects, Neo4j and Dgraph are strong choices, while NetworkX, Gephi, and Gource are great for standalone graph exploration and analysis.
