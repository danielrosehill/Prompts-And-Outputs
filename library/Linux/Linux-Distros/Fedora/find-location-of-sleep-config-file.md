reaIf you don't see `sleep.conf` in the usual location (`/etc/systemd/`), that's okay—it's likely because this configuration file doesn't exist by default until you create it or modify the sleep settings on your system. You can still create it, or look into systemd's default configuration directories to see how sleep settings are being handled on your **Fedora Workstation 40** system.

Here are a few methods to locate where sleep settings might be configured or create your own `sleep.conf`:

### 1. **Default Sleep Configuration Directory**
On most systems using `systemd`, the `sleep.conf` file may not be present by default, but it can be configured by creating a file in the following locations:

- **Primary Location** (for user overrides):
  - `/etc/systemd/sleep.conf` – If you want to create or customize your sleep settings.
- **Default Location**:
  - `/usr/lib/systemd/sleep.conf` – System defaults set by `systemd`. Sometimes it may be `/usr/lib/systemd/system/sleep.conf.d/`. This directory contains the default configuration files that apply if `/etc/systemd/sleep.conf` is not found.

To check if there's a default configuration provided by the system:
```bash
ls /usr/lib/systemd/sleep.conf
```
or
```bash
ls /usr/lib/systemd/system/sleep.conf.d/
```
If this file or directory exists, it will contain the default settings.

### 2. **Creating `/etc/systemd/sleep.conf`**
If the `/etc/systemd/sleep.conf` file does not exist, you can **create it yourself** to override any default settings. Here's how:

- **Create the File**:
  ```bash
  sudo nano /etc/systemd/sleep.conf
  ```
- **Add Custom Sleep Settings**:
  Add the following content to customize sleep behavior. For example, to use **Suspend-to-RAM**:
  ```ini
  [Sleep]
  SuspendState=mem
  HibernateState=disk
  HybridSleepState=hybrid-sleep
  ```

### 3. **Check System Sleep Settings Using `systemctl`**
You can also inspect sleep targets and verify current behavior with the `systemctl` command.

- To see **which sleep modes are enabled** on your system:
  ```bash
  cat /sys/power/state
  ```
  Common values might include `freeze`, `standby`, `mem`, `disk`. The presence of `mem` indicates that Suspend-to-RAM is available.

### 4. **Look for Sleep Settings in Other `systemd` Configuration Files**
Sometimes sleep settings might be included in custom **drop-in** configurations within the `/etc/systemd/` or `/usr/lib/systemd/` directory. You can search for these configurations:

- **Check Drop-In Files**:
  ```bash
  find /etc/systemd/ -name "*.conf"
  find /usr/lib/systemd/ -name "*.conf"
  ```
  This will list all `.conf` files, which could include sleep configuration or other settings.

- **Check for Directories with Sleep Configurations**:
  Sometimes, system services may have directories that include **drop-in configurations** for overriding or extending functionality:
  ```bash
  ls /etc/systemd/system/sleep.target.wants/
  ls /usr/lib/systemd/system/sleep.target.wants/
  ```

### 5. **Use `man` for Additional Info**
If you're not sure what each sleep state means or want to see all the available options for `sleep.conf`, use the manual:

```bash
man sleep.conf
```
This command will show you all the possible options you can configure in `/etc/systemd/sleep.conf`, including `SuspendState`, `HibernateState`, etc.

### **Summary:**
1. **Check Existing Files**: Look for `/usr/lib/systemd/sleep.conf` or `/usr/lib/systemd/system/sleep.conf.d/`.
2. **Create `/etc/systemd/sleep.conf`**: If it doesn’t exist, create it yourself to override default settings.
3. **Inspect Available Sleep States**: Use `/sys/power/state` to check the supported sleep states.
4. **Search for Related Configurations**: Look for `.conf` files in system directories to see if sleep settings are set elsewhere.

By creating or editing `/etc/systemd/sleep.conf`, you can explicitly control your system's behavior for sleep modes. Let me know if you need help creating or modifying the file further!

# Creating Files

No, you **should not directly modify** `/usr/lib/systemd/sleep.conf`. Files in `/usr/lib/systemd/` are **system defaults** provided by the package maintainers and can be **overwritten** during updates. Instead, it is best practice to **override** these settings by creating or modifying the configuration in `/etc/systemd/`.

### Best Practice: Override Configuration in `/etc/systemd/`

1. **Create or Modify `/etc/systemd/sleep.conf`**:
   - If you need to change sleep settings, it’s best to **create a file** called `/etc/systemd/sleep.conf` if it doesn’t already exist.
   - The `/etc/systemd/` directory is where user-level customizations and overrides should be placed, and these files are **never overwritten** by system updates.

   To create or modify `/etc/systemd/sleep.conf`, use:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/systemd/sleep.conf
   ```
   Then add or modify your desired settings. For example:
   ```ini
   [Sleep]
   SuspendState=mem
   HibernateState=disk
   HybridSleepState=hybrid-sleep
   ```
   This configuration will override any default settings in `/usr/lib/systemd/sleep.conf`.

2. **Reload Configuration**:
   After creating or modifying `/etc/systemd/sleep.conf`, reload the system configuration for changes to take effect:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   ```

3. **Why Not Change `/usr/lib/systemd/sleep.conf`?**
   - **Overwritten on Updates**: Files in `/usr/lib/systemd/` are managed by the package manager. Any updates to `systemd` or the relevant package can **overwrite** your changes.
   - **Best Practice**: The `/etc/` directory is reserved for user overrides to ensure that changes persist across updates.

### Alternative: Use Drop-In Configuration
Another option to override specific configurations is to use a **drop-in directory**. This is useful if you only need to modify certain parameters without creating a full configuration file.

1. **Create a Drop-In Directory** for Sleep Configurations:
   - You can create a directory to add only the settings you wish to override.
   ```bash
   sudo mkdir -p /etc/systemd/sleep.conf.d
   ```
   
2. **Create a Drop-In Configuration File**:
   - Create a configuration file in the newly created directory:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/systemd/sleep.conf.d/custom.conf
   ```
   - Add the specific settings you want to override:
   ```ini
   [Sleep]
   SuspendState=mem
   ```
   This way, the settings defined in `/usr/lib/systemd/sleep.conf` will still be used, except for those you override in `/etc/systemd/sleep.conf.d/custom.conf`.

### Summary:
- **Do Not Modify `/usr/lib/systemd/sleep.conf`** directly, as it may be overwritten during system updates.
- **Create or modify `/etc/systemd/sleep.conf`** to safely customize your system's sleep settings.
- Alternatively, use **drop-in configuration files** in `/etc/systemd/sleep.conf.d/` for more granular changes.

By following these best practices, you ensure that your changes are persistent, system updates won’t affect them, and you maintain a clear distinction between system defaults and custom configurations. Let me know if you need any more assistance!
