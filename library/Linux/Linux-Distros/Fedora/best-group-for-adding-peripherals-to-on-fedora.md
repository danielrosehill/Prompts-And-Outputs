Given the groups your user is already a member of, here’s a brief assessment of each:

### **Group Assessment for Adding the Device**
1. **`wheel`**:
   - **Pros**: Members of the `wheel` group usually have elevated permissions (like `sudo`), so adding the device here would ensure unrestricted access.
   - **Cons**: Because this group is meant for administrative privileges, it can pose a **security risk** if you have other users in this group who shouldn't have access to the device. It’s a bit broad and may give more permissions than needed.

2. **`input`**:
   - **Pros**: The `input` group is typically used for devices related to user inputs (like keyboards, mice, and sometimes NFC devices). This could be a good fit because it’s often associated with device interactions.
   - **Cons**: Depends on how `input` is set up on your system. Adding the device here may not guarantee the same level of access as `wheel`, but it is less of a security risk.

3. **`ollama`, `12c`, `docker`**:
   - These groups don’t seem directly relevant to USB device permissions. 
   - **`docker`** is typically for running containers, while **`ollama`** and **`12c`** are likely specific to particular apps or services. Adding the device to any of these might not be the best match.

### **Recommendation**
The **best choice** would be:
1. **Try adding the device to `input` first**:
   - This is the least intrusive and most relevant group for handling devices. If it doesn’t work, it’s easy to revert.
   - **Udev Rule**:
     ```bash
     SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="072f", ATTRS{idProduct}=="2200", GROUP="input", MODE="0666"
     ```

2. **If `input` doesn’t work, consider `wheel`**:
   - While not ideal from a security perspective, it will certainly work since `wheel` has elevated permissions. Be cautious about who else is in the `wheel` group.
   - **Udev Rule**:
     ```bash
     SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="072f", ATTRS{idProduct}=="2200", GROUP="wheel", MODE="0666"
     ```

### **Steps to Apply**
1. **Edit/Create the Udev Rule**:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/udev/rules.d/99-nfc.rules
   ```

2. **Add the Rule**:
   ```bash
   SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="072f", ATTRS{idProduct}=="2200", GROUP="input", MODE="0666"
   ```

3. **Reload and Test**:
   ```bash
   sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
   sudo udevadm trigger
   ```

4. **Check Access with `lsusb` and NFC Tools**.

This approach should give your **NFC reader** the correct permissions to be accessed without having to rely on `sudo`. Let me know if it works!
