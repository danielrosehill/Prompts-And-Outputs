**Summary of the prompt:** The user asked if there is a way to check on Fedora whether a specific AppImage has access to USB devices.

On Fedora (or any Linux system), AppImages are generally sandboxed but do not inherently restrict access to USB devices unless configured explicitly. Unlike Flatpak or Snap, AppImages don't have built-in permission management, so their access control relies on the broader system permissions and any sandboxing wrappers used.

To check whether an AppImage can access USB devices, consider the following:

1. **Check Running Processes and Device Access:**
   - Use `lsusb` to see connected USB devices and `lsof` or `fuser` to check if the AppImage process is interacting with any device files under `/dev`.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     sudo lsof /dev/ttyUSB*   # Replace with the appropriate device path if known
     ```
   - This will show if the AppImage process has any open file descriptors on USB devices.

2. **Inspect AppArmor or SELinux Policies:**
   - If your system uses AppArmor or SELinux, they can restrict USB access. Check if there are specific rules for the AppImage.
   - For SELinux, check logs via:
     ```bash
     sudo ausearch -m avc -ts recent
     ```
   - This command shows recent SELinux access denials.

3. **Check Sandbox Wrappers (Firejail or Bubblewrap):**
   - If you run the AppImage through a sandbox like Firejail, it might restrict USB access.
   - Check the configuration:
     ```bash
     firejail --list
     ```
   - Review the profile to see if USB access is blocked or permitted.

4. **Monitor USB Activity:**
   - Use `udevadm monitor` to watch for real-time USB events. If you launch the AppImage and see activity, it might indicate access:
     ```bash
     sudo udevadm monitor
     ```

By combining these checks, you can determine if a specific AppImage is interacting with USB devices on your Fedora system.
