# Prompt

I'd like to develop a custom desktop app for my fedora computer. From what you've told me, Electron sounds like a smart choice for what I'm looking to setup.

I'm looking to create a custom news monitoring app for myself. I'd like the app to have a grid layout and to define the URLs that are embedded into those grids. The URLs would be news websites and live TV streams, so those functionalities would need to be supported. 

Can you give me a kind of quick start guide on how to do this and maybe even help me to set it up?

# Output

Certainly! Electron is indeed a great choice for developing a custom desktop application, especially for a news monitoring app with embedded web content. Here's a quick start guide to help you set up your project and create a basic version of your news monitoring app.

## Setting Up Your Electron Project

1. First, create a new directory for your project and navigate to it:

```bash
mkdir news-monitor-app && cd news-monitor-app
```

2. Initialize a new Node.js project:

```bash
npm init -y
```

3. Install Electron as a development dependency:

```bash
npm install --save-dev electron
```

4. Create the main application files:

```bash
touch main.js index.html renderer.js
```

5. Update the `package.json` file to include a start script:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "electron ."
  }
}
```

## Creating the Main Process File

Edit `main.js` to set up the main process:

```javascript
const { app, BrowserWindow } = require('electron')
const path = require('path')

function createWindow() {
  const win = new BrowserWindow({
    width: 1200,
    height: 800,
    webPreferences: {
      nodeIntegration: true,
      contextIsolation: false
    }
  })

  win.loadFile('index.html')
}

app.whenReady().then(createWindow)

app.on('window-all-closed', () => {
  if (process.platform !== 'darwin') app.quit()
})

app.on('activate', () => {
  if (BrowserWindow.getAllWindows().length === 0) createWindow()
})
```

## Creating the HTML File

Edit `index.html` to create the basic structure of your app:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>News Monitor</title>
    <style>
        body { margin: 0; padding: 0; }
        .grid-container {
            display: grid;
            grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);
            grid-gap: 10px;
            padding: 10px;
            height: 100vh;
        }
        .grid-item {
            border: 1px solid #ccc;
            overflow: hidden;
        }
        webview {
            width: 100%;
            height: 100%;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <div class="grid-container">
        <div class="grid-item">
            <webview src="https://www.bbc.com/news" allowfullscreen></webview>
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item">
            <webview src="https://www.cnn.com" allowfullscreen></webview>
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item">
            <webview src="https://www.aljazeera.com" allowfullscreen></webview>
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item">
            <webview src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/live_stream?channel=UCeY0bbntWzzVIaj2z3QigXg" allowfullscreen></webview>
        </div>
    </div>
    <script src="renderer.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

## Creating the Renderer Process File

Edit `renderer.js` to handle any client-side logic:

```javascript
// You can add any client-side JavaScript here
console.log('Renderer process is running');
```

## Running Your App

To run your app, use the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

This basic setup creates a news monitoring app with a 2x2 grid layout, embedding three news websites and a live YouTube stream. You can customize the URLs and layout as needed.

## Next Steps and Customization

1. **Dynamic URL Loading**: Implement functionality to allow users to input and save their preferred URLs.

2. **Layout Customization**: Add options to change the grid layout (e.g., 3x3, 4x4).

3. **Refresh Controls**: Add buttons to refresh individual webviews or all at once.

4. **Performance Optimization**: Implement lazy loading for webviews not currently visible.

5. **Local Storage**: Use Electron's `localStorage` API to save user preferences.

6. **Menu Bar**: Create a custom menu for easy navigation and settings access.

Remember to handle errors and edge cases, especially when dealing with live streams and potentially unavailable websites. Also, be mindful of the resource usage, as multiple live streams can be CPU and memory-intensive.

This setup provides a solid foundation for your news monitoring app. You can expand on this base to add more features and customization options as needed[1][2][3][4].
