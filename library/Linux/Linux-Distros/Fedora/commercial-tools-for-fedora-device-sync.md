# Prompt

You might recall earlier that I was trying to see if there were any ways to keep my Fedora laptop in sync with my desktop. I use my desktop much more and would love to be able to sync over my package installations and removals. There's Ansible but it's difficult to set up. Are there any commercial tools which specialise in syncing multiple devices and which support Fedora as an OS?

# Output

Based on your query and the search results provided, there are a few options that could potentially help you sync your Fedora laptop with your desktop, including package installations and removals. While not all of these are strictly commercial tools, they offer robust synchronization capabilities that could meet your needs:

1. Syncthing:
Syncthing is a continuous file synchronization program that supports Fedora and other Linux distributions[1]. While it's not a commercial tool, it offers features that might be useful for your scenario:

- Open-source and free to use
- Supports real-time synchronization between multiple devices
- Encrypted and private, with no central server
- Can sync specific folders between your laptop and desktop

While Syncthing doesn't directly handle package synchronization, you could use it to sync a folder containing scripts or configuration files that manage your packages.

2. Syncovery:
Syncovery is a commercial backup and synchronization tool that supports Linux, including Fedora[3]. It offers:

- File and folder synchronization between multiple devices
- Support for various protocols (SFTP, WebDAV, etc.)
- A web-based GUI for easy management
- Scheduling and automation features

Pricing for Syncovery starts at $39.95 for a single computer license, with various tiers available for multiple computers and advanced features.

3. Resilio Sync (formerly BitTorrent Sync):
While not mentioned in the provided search results, Resilio Sync is a commercial peer-to-peer file synchronization tool that supports Linux:

- Offers both free and paid versions
- Supports real-time synchronization between devices
- End-to-end encryption
- No file size limits

Pricing for Resilio Sync starts at $59.90 per year for individuals, with business plans also available.

For syncing package installations and removals specifically, you might consider combining one of these synchronization tools with a custom script that:

1. Periodically generates a list of installed packages on your desktop
2. Syncs this list to your laptop
3. Runs a script on your laptop to install/remove packages based on the synced list

This approach would allow you to keep your package installations in sync across devices while using a robust synchronization tool for file management.

Remember to test any solution thoroughly in a non-critical environment before implementing it on your main systems. Also, be cautious when automatically syncing package installations, as it could potentially lead to conflicts or issues if not managed carefully.

# Input

Hmm. None of these are good suggestions, I'm afraid. I'm very specifically looking for device configuration sync. Just the software packages and config files, not the other stuff. Anything else?

# Output

I apologize for the confusion in my previous responses. You're right that the options I mentioned earlier don't specifically address your need for device configuration sync, especially for Fedora systems. Let me provide a more focused answer based on your requirements:

For syncing package installations and configurations between Fedora devices, there aren't many commercial tools specifically designed for this purpose. However, there are some open-source solutions that might help:

1. Ansible:
   You mentioned Ansible is difficult to set up, but it remains one of the most powerful tools for configuration management. While not a commercial solution, it can be used to sync package installations and configurations across multiple Fedora systems.

2. Puppet:
   Another open-source configuration management tool that can be used to manage package installations and configurations across multiple systems, including Fedora.

3. Salt:
   Similar to Ansible and Puppet, Salt is an open-source configuration management and remote execution tool that can be used to manage package installations and configurations across multiple Fedora systems.

For a more commercial-oriented solution, you might consider:

4. Red Hat Satellite:
   While it's an enterprise-level solution and might be overkill for personal use, Red Hat Satellite provides comprehensive system management capabilities for Red Hat-based systems, including Fedora. It can manage package installations, configurations, and more across multiple systems.

5. CFEngine:
   CFEngine is a configuration management system that offers both open-source and commercial versions. It can be used to manage package installations and configurations across multiple systems, including Fedora.

Unfortunately, there aren't many commercial tools specifically designed for syncing Fedora configurations between devices. Most enterprise-level solutions are geared towards Red Hat Enterprise Linux rather than Fedora.

For a simpler approach, you could consider creating custom scripts that:
1. Generate a list of installed packages on your desktop
2. Sync this list to your laptop (using tools like rsync or Syncthing)
3. Use the list to keep packages in sync on your laptop

This approach, while not a commercial solution, could be more straightforward to set up than Ansible and still achieve your goal of keeping your Fedora installations in sync.
