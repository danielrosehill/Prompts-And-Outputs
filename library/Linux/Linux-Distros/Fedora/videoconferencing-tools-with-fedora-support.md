# Prompt

Please suggest some advanced videoconferencing tools that have clients for Fedora Linux. Zoom is fine but is there anything a bit more advanced and with deeper integration with this particular OS?

# Output

Based on your requirements for an advanced videoconferencing tool with good integration for Fedora Linux, here are some suggestions:

1. Jitsi Meet
Jitsi Meet is an open-source platform that offers advanced features and works well on Fedora Linux. It provides:
- End-to-end encryption
- Screen sharing
- Live streaming
- Integration with calendar systems
- Custom branding options

You can use the web version or install the desktop client on Fedora. Jitsi also allows self-hosting for enhanced privacy and control.

2. BigBlueButton
While primarily designed for online learning, BigBlueButton offers advanced features that can be useful for general videoconferencing:
- Whiteboard and screen sharing
- Breakout rooms
- Polling and shared notes
- Recording capabilities

It's open-source and can be self-hosted on Fedora servers.

3. Nextcloud Talk
If you're already using Nextcloud, its Talk feature provides a privacy-focused videoconferencing solution:
- End-to-end encryption
- Screen sharing
- File sharing during calls
- Integration with other Nextcloud apps

Nextcloud has good Linux support, including Fedora.

4. Element (formerly Riot)
Element is a client for the Matrix protocol, offering:
- End-to-end encryption
- Screen sharing
- File transfer
- Bridge to other communication platforms

It has a native Flatpak application available for Fedora.

5. TrueConf
TrueConf offers a Linux client that works on Fedora. It provides:
- 4K video support
- Content sharing
- Remote desktop control
- Intelligent noise reduction
- Background blurring/replacement

While not open-source, it offers more advanced features than typical consumer-grade tools.

These options provide deeper integration with Fedora Linux compared to Zoom, either through native applications or by allowing self-hosting. They also offer advanced features that go beyond basic videoconferencing, potentially providing a more tailored solution for your needs.

Remember to check the specific Fedora version compatibility for these tools, as support may vary between releases.
