Can you provide a list of terminals that can be used on Fedora and which have native support for split screen use? I'd ideally like to split my terminal pane into four / a quad layout

Here’s a list of terminal emulators that are **available on Fedora** and natively support **split-screen** functionality, including a **quad layout** (splitting the terminal into four panes):

### 1. **GNOME Terminal (with tmux or by itself)**
   - **Description**: GNOME Terminal is the default terminal for the GNOME desktop. It doesn’t natively support split screens, but when paired with **tmux** or **screen**, you can achieve a quad layout.
   - **How to enable split screens**:
     - Use **tmux** (see below) to split GNOME Terminal into multiple panes.
   - **Installation**: 
     ```bash
     sudo dnf install gnome-terminal
     ```

### 2. **tmux (Terminal Multiplexer)**
   - **Description**: **tmux** is a powerful terminal multiplexer that allows for splitting your terminal into multiple panes. It is highly configurable and can split your terminal into a quad layout.
   - **How to split**: 
     - Vertical split: `Ctrl + B, %`
     - Horizontal split: `Ctrl + B, "`
   - **Installation**:
     ```bash
     sudo dnf install tmux
     ```

### 3. **Terminator**
   - **Description**: Terminator is a popular terminal emulator known for its **native support for split screens**, allowing for a **quad layout** without needing additional tools like tmux. You can split both vertically and horizontally as needed.
   - **How to split**: Right-click in the terminal and choose to split horizontally or vertically.
   - **Installation**:
     ```bash
     sudo dnf install terminator
     ```

### 4. **Tilix**
   - **Description**: **Tilix** is a tiling terminal emulator designed for GNOME, supporting **split screen natively**. It’s particularly good for organizing multiple terminal panes in different layouts, including a quad layout.
   - **How to split**: Use the menu or shortcuts like `Ctrl + Shift + O` (split horizontally) and `Ctrl + Shift + E` (split vertically).
   - **Installation**:
     ```bash
     sudo dnf install tilix
     ```

### 5. **Konsole (with tmux)**
   - **Description**: **Konsole** is the default terminal for the KDE desktop environment. While it doesn’t natively support split screens, you can achieve it through **tmux**.
   - **Installation**:
     ```bash
     sudo dnf install konsole
     ```

### 6. **Alacritty (with tmux or terminal multiplexer)**
   - **Description**: **Alacritty** is a lightweight and GPU-accelerated terminal emulator that can handle split screens when used in conjunction with **tmux** or **byobu**.
   - **Installation**:
     ```bash
     sudo dnf install alacritty
     ```

### 7. **Kitty**
   - **Description**: **Kitty** is a fast, feature-rich GPU-accelerated terminal that natively supports split screens. You can split the terminal into multiple panes directly within Kitty itself.
   - **How to split**: You can split horizontally with `Ctrl + Shift + Enter` and vertically with `Ctrl + Shift + D`.
   - **Installation**:
     ```bash
     sudo dnf install kitty
     ```

### Summary:
If you want **native split-screen support**, **Terminator**, **Tilix**, and **Kitty** are great options. For maximum flexibility and more advanced features, **tmux** paired with any terminal is a solid choice.

Would you like help setting up any of these terminals?
