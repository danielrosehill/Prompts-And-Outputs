# Prompt

Thanks. Any other notepads you can recommend on Fedora - whether lightweight or a bit more elaborate? I jot down prompts and code snippets almost constantly!

# Output

You're welcome! Since you frequently jot down **prompts** and **code snippets**, it might be useful to consider both lightweight and more elaborate options that provide useful features like **syntax highlighting**, **tabbed interfaces**, or **basic project management**. Here’s a mix of lightweight and more advanced text editors that work well on **Fedora**:

### **Lightweight Notepad Alternatives**:

1. **Geany**
   - **Description**: A lightweight and fast text editor that’s more feature-rich than a basic notepad but still remains highly responsive.
   - **Features**: Syntax highlighting, auto-completion, tabs, line numbers, and a simple project management tool.
   - **Why it's great for you**: It’s perfect for jotting down code snippets and prompts without the heaviness of a full IDE.
   - **Install**:
     ```bash
     sudo dnf install geany
     ```

2. **Nano**

### Summary of Editors:

- **Ultra-lightweight**: 
  - **Leafpad**, **Mousepad**, **Nano**, **Tilde**, and **FeatherPad** are great for quick note-taking with minimal features.
  
- **Mid-tier with features**:
  - **Geany**, **Kate**, **Notepadqq**, and **Sublime Text** are lightweight but offer more robust code editing features, making them great for notes and coding.
  
- **More elaborate**:
  - **Atom**, **Visual Studio Code** are more feature-rich and extensible with plugins, useful for handling both notes and coding needs in one tool.

Given that you take notes and store code snippets frequently, a combination of **Geany** for lightweight editing and **Sublime Text** or **VS Code** for more structured code editing could work really well for your workflow.
