# Prompt

Thanks for that info. I'd like to explore two different possibilities. One is creating an encrypted partition within the existing filesystem (if that's possible). And the other is simply creating something like an encrypted vault (ie a folder) with a software solution. Can you explore the feasibility of both options?

# Output

You're welcome! Both approaches you mentioned—creating an encrypted partition within your existing filesystem and using an encrypted vault (folder)—are feasible. Let's explore each option in detail, with their feasibility, advantages, and instructions:

### 1. **Option 1: Creating an Encrypted Partition within the Existing Filesystem (LUKS on BTRFS)**
This option involves creating a new encrypted partition within your existing BTRFS setup without wiping out the existing data.

#### Feasibility
- **Possible**: You can add an encrypted partition to your system, but this will involve resizing your current partitions and creating a new LUKS-encrypted one. You will then layer BTRFS on top of the LUKS partition.
- **No Data Loss**: As long as you are careful and back up your data, this process can be done without data loss. However, resizing partitions always carries some risk, so backups are critical.
  
#### Steps to Implement
1. **Backup Your Data**: Always the first step when modifying partitions.
   
2. **Shrink the Existing BTRFS Partition**:
   - You’ll need to resize your existing BTRFS partition to make space for the new encrypted partition.
   - Use a partitioning tool like **GParted** to shrink the BTRFS partition. This will free up space on the drive.

3. **Create the LUKS-encrypted Partition**:
   - Once you’ve freed up space, create a new partition in that space and set it up as a **LUKS-encrypted partition**. This can be done using the `cryptsetup` command:
     ```bash
     cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/sdXn
     cryptsetup open /dev/sdXn my_encrypted_partition
     ```
   - Replace `/dev/sdXn` with the actual partition name.

4. **Format the LUKS Partition with BTRFS**:
   - After opening the encrypted partition, format it with BTRFS:
     ```bash
     mkfs.btrfs /dev/mapper/my_encrypted_partition
     ```

5. **Mount and Use**:
   - Mount the encrypted partition where you want (e.g., `/mnt/encrypted`) and configure `/etc/fstab` to automatically mount it at boot (if desired).
   - To unlock the encrypted partition at boot, you’ll need to enter the passphrase or set up automatic unlocking with a USB key or TPM module.

#### Pros
- **Whole-Partition Encryption**: Ensures that everything on the partition is encrypted and protected.
- **Flexible Use**: You can use this partition like any other BTRFS partition, benefiting from all BTRFS features (snapshots, compression, etc.).

#### Cons
- **More Complex Setup**: Requires partition resizing and manual setup.
- **Permanent Disk Space Allocation**: Once the partition size is set, resizing it later can be complicated.

### 2. **Option 2: Creating an Encrypted Vault or Folder (Using Software like VeraCrypt)**
This approach involves creating an encrypted container or vault within your existing filesystem. The vault is like a file that acts as a virtual encrypted disk when mounted.

#### Feasibility
- **Highly Feasible**: This is a simple and effective way to secure sensitive files without modifying partitions. Software solutions like **VeraCrypt**, **Cryptsetup** (with loopback devices), or **eCryptfs** allow you to create a vault (an encrypted file) that can be mounted as an encrypted volume.

#### Steps to Implement

##### Using **VeraCrypt**:
1. **Install VeraCrypt**:
   - Install VeraCrypt on Fedora using:
     ```bash
     sudo dnf install veracrypt
     ```

2. **Create an Encrypted Volume**:
   - Open VeraCrypt and select "Create Volume."
   - Choose **Create an encrypted file container**.
   - Specify the location for the vault (e.g., `/home/your_user/vault`), and choose the desired size for the encrypted volume.
   - Choose the encryption algorithm (AES is a solid option) and format (use ext4 or BTRFS).

3. **Mount the Vault**:
   - You can mount the vault through VeraCrypt’s interface, where it will act like a separate drive. You’ll need to enter a password each time you mount it.
   - After mounting, you can store files in it just like a normal folder.

4. **Unmount When Done**:
   - Once you’re done, unmount the encrypted volume to lock it. No one can access the data without the password.

##### Using **Cryptsetup (LUKS) with a Loopback Device**:
1. **Create an Empty File**:
   - Create an empty file that will act as the encrypted container (vault):
     ```bash
     dd if=/dev/zero of=/home/your_user/vault.img bs=1M count=1000
     ```
   - This example creates a 1GB encrypted container file.

2. **Encrypt the File with LUKS**:
   - Use `cryptsetup` to format the file as an encrypted volume:
     ```bash
     cryptsetup luksFormat /home/your_user/vault.img
     cryptsetup open /home/your_user/vault.img my_vault
     ```

3. **Format and Use**:
   - Format the vault with a filesystem (e.g., BTRFS):
     ```bash
     mkfs.btrfs /dev/mapper/my_vault
     mount /dev/mapper/my_vault /mnt/encrypted_vault
     ```
   - You can now use `/mnt/encrypted_vault` like any other folder.

4. **Unmount and Close**:
   - When finished, unmount and close the vault:
     ```bash
     umount /mnt/encrypted_vault
     cryptsetup close my_vault
     ```

#### Pros
- **Simple Setup**: No need to modify partitions or resize disk space.
- **Flexible Size**: You can dynamically adjust the size of the vault by creating a larger or smaller file.
- **Portable**: Encrypted files (vaults) can be easily transferred to other systems or drives, maintaining security.

#### Cons
- **Single File**: The vault is a single file on the disk. If it becomes corrupted, you could lose access to all the data inside.
- **Manual Mounting**: You need to manually mount the vault each time you want to use it (although you can automate this process).

### Conclusion

1. **Encrypted Partition (LUKS on BTRFS)**:
   - Best for full encryption of large amounts of data. Offers robust encryption, but requires partition resizing and manual setup.
   - Suitable for higher security needs where permanent encrypted storage is required.

2. **Encrypted Vault (VeraCrypt or Cryptsetup Loopback)**:
   - Easier to implement and more flexible. No need to resize partitions, and you can create or delete encrypted vaults (folders) as needed.
   - Ideal for securing specific files and folders without affecting the rest of the filesystem.

Both options are viable. If you want to secure large amounts of data and integrate encryption into your existing partitioning, the LUKS partition approach is best. For more flexibility and ease of use, the encrypted vault method (using VeraCrypt or LUKS with loopback) might be preferable.

Would you like more detailed instructions or guidance on setting up either of these methods?
