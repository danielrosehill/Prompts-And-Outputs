# Prompt

Can you recommend some very simple text editors that I can use in Fedora just to quickly write notes. I don't want a full distraction free editor, just a notepad. I use Kwrite but I'm wondering is there something even simpler

# Output

For Fedora, there are several **lightweight text editors** that you can use for quickly writing notes. If you're looking for something even simpler than **KWrite**, here are some great options that offer minimal features for note-taking without unnecessary distractions:

### 1. **Leafpad**
- **Description**: A very lightweight and simple text editor. It has a clean interface, making it perfect for quick note-taking without any distractions.
- **Features**: Basic text editing, fast startup, and minimal memory usage.
- **Install**:
  ```bash
  sudo dnf install leafpad
  ```

### 2. **Xed**
- **Description**: A simple text editor originally developed for Linux Mint's Cinnamon desktop. It's lightweight and easy to use, similar to the classic Notepad on Windows.
- **Features**: Syntax highlighting, line numbering, and a minimalistic UI.
- **Install**:
  ```bash
  sudo dnf install xed
  ```

### 3. **Mousepad**
- **Description**: The default text editor for the Xfce desktop, Mousepad is very lightweight but includes a few more features than Leafpad.
- **Features**: Syntax highlighting, search and replace, and line numbers.
- **Install**:
  ```bash
  sudo dnf install mousepad
  ```

### 4. **Tilde**
- **Description**: A terminal-based text editor that is extremely simple but still easy to use. It offers some of the convenience of GUI editors but works in a terminal, making it fast and efficient.
- **Features**: Terminal-based, basic text editing, minimal key bindings.
- **Install**:
  ```bash
  sudo dnf install tilde
  ```

### 5. **Medit**
- **Description**: A light and simple text editor with a clean UI. It is similar in spirit to Leafpad but comes with a few extra features like tabs and syntax highlighting.
- **Features**: Tabs, syntax highlighting, simple interface.
- **Install**:
  ```bash
  sudo dnf install medit
  ```

### 6. **FeatherPad**
- **Description**: A very lightweight Qt-based text editor designed to be as simple as possible while still supporting features like tabs and line numbers.
- **Features**: Line numbers, tabs, simple search, and fast startup.
- **Install**:
  ```bash
  sudo dnf install featherpad
  ```

### 7. **Gedit (Minimal Plugins)**
- **Description**: While **Gedit** is part of the GNOME desktop and more feature-rich, you can configure it to be minimal by disabling plugins.
- **Features**: Basic editing, syntax highlighting, optional tabs (can disable unwanted features).
- **Install**:
  ```bash
  sudo dnf install gedit
  ```

### Summary:
If you're looking for something even simpler than **KWrite**, I recommend trying **Leafpad** or **Mousepad** for their minimal features and fast performance. **FeatherPad** or **Tilde** are also excellent choices if you want something ultra-light but still functional. All of these editors are perfect for quickly jotting down notes without distractions.
