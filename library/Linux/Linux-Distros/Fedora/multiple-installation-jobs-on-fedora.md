# Prompt

Can you teach me how to batch together multiple installation jobs on Fedora in a way that the process won't fail if one package doesn't exist or isn't available?

# Output

Certainly! To batch together multiple installation jobs on Fedora in a way that the process won't fail if one package doesn't exist or isn't available, you can use the `dnf` package manager with some specific options. Here's a method to achieve this:

1. Use the `dnf install` command with the `--setopt=strict=0` option. This tells DNF to continue with the installation even if some packages are not found.

2. Add the `--allowerasing` option to allow DNF to remove conflicting packages if necessary.

3. Use the `--skip-broken` option to skip packages that have broken dependencies.

4. Optionally, you can add `--nobest` to allow DNF to install an older version of a package if the latest version can't be installed.

Here's an example command that incorporates these options:

```bash
sudo dnf install --setopt=strict=0 --allowerasing --skip-broken --nobest package1 package2 package3 package4
```

This command will attempt to install package1, package2, package3, and package4. If any of these packages don't exist or can't be installed due to conflicts or broken dependencies, DNF will skip them and continue with the others.

If you want to make this process even more robust, you can create a simple bash script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

packages=(
  package1
  package2
  package3
  package4
  # Add more packages here
)

for package in "${packages[@]}"
do
  sudo dnf install --setopt=strict=0 --allowerasing --skip-broken --nobest "$package"
done
```

This script will attempt to install each package individually, which can be helpful if you want to see which specific packages failed to install.

Remember to replace "package1", "package2", etc., with the actual names of the packages you want to install.

Also, keep in mind that while this method allows the installation process to continue even if some packages fail, it's important to review the output afterwards to ensure that all critical packages were installed successfully.
