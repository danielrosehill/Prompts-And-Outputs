# Prompt

I'm using an Ubuntu VM. I'd like the system to stop asking me for the sudo password. How can I make this change ... ideally all in one command

# Output

To stop the system from asking for the **sudo** password on your Ubuntu VM, you can modify the **sudoers** file to allow passwordless access. You can achieve this in one command:

```bash
echo "$(whoami) ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL" | sudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/nopasswd > /dev/null
```

### Explanation:
- `$(whoami)` inserts the current username.
- `ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL` allows the user to execute any command as any user without a password.
- `sudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/nopasswd` creates a file in the sudoers directory for this specific configuration, preserving system-wide settings.
- `> /dev/null` suppresses the output of the command.

This change ensures that your Ubuntu VM will no longer ask for a password when using `sudo`.
