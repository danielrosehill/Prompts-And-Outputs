**Summary of the prompt:** You are running Proxmox and have shared screenshots showing your system resources and virtual machines. You are considering expanding the Ubuntu VM to use as much of the Proxmox host resources as possible, leaving enough room for Home Assistant.

### **Assessment of Your Current Setup:**
From the images, I can see the following details:

- **Proxmox Host Resources**:
  - **CPU**: 4 cores (2% usage)
  - **Memory**: 31.28 GB total (37% used)
  - **Storage**: 7.57 TiB total (15% used)

- **VM 105 (Ubuntu Server VM)**:
  - **Memory**: 11.72 GB
  - **Processors**: 2 sockets, 1 core
  - **Storage**: 500 GB

- **VM 101 (Home Assistant OS)**:
  - **Memory**: 9.77 GB
  - **Processors**: 2 sockets, 2 cores
  - **Storage**: 32 GB

### **Recommendations for Expanding the Ubuntu VM:**

Since you want to allocate more resources to the **Ubuntu VM** (VM 105), I suggest the following configuration updates, based on your available capacity and need to leave resources for Home Assistant (VM 101):

#### **1. Memory (RAM) Allocation:**
- You have **31.28 GB** of total RAM on the host, and you are currently using 37%, meaning roughly **19.72 GB** is free.
- Home Assistant is using **9.77 GB**. To ensure that Home Assistant has enough room for future growth, reserve **10-12 GB** for it.
- For the **Ubuntu VM**, increase its memory to **18 GB** (from the current 11.72 GB), leaving some buffer for Home Assistant and future VM needs.

#### **2. CPU Allocation:**
- You currently have **4 cores** available on the host, with **minimal CPU usage** (2%).
- The Ubuntu VM is assigned **1 core**. You can safely expand this to **2 cores**, which should be sufficient for a general-purpose server.
- Ensure **Home Assistant** continues using its **2 cores** (as shown in the current setup).

#### **3. Storage Allocation:**
- Your total storage is **7.57 TiB**, and only **1.10 TiB** is in use (15%).
- The **Ubuntu VM** currently has **500 GB** allocated. You can expand this to **2 TB** (depending on the growth you anticipate for this VM).
- Ensure **Home Assistant** has enough space (32 GB is allocated for it now, which should be enough unless you anticipate a larger data volume for Home Assistant).

### **Updated Configuration for Ubuntu VM (VM 105):**

- **Memory**: Increase to **18 GB**.
- **Processors**: Increase to **2 cores**.
- **Storage**: Expand to **2 TB**.

#### **Steps to Perform the Update**:

1. **Shut Down the Ubuntu VM (VM 105)**:
   - Go to the VM in the Proxmox interface and shut it down to adjust the hardware settings.

2. **Increase Memory**:
   - In Proxmox, select the **Memory** option under the **Hardware** tab for the VM.
   - Set it to **18 GB** (or 18,432 MB).

3. **Increase CPU Cores**:
   - Under the **Processors** option, increase the cores from 1 to **2**.

4. **Expand Storage**:
   - Select the **Hard Disk (scsi0)** option under the **Hardware** tab.
   - Click **Resize Disk** and increase the size to **2 TB** (or 2048 GB).
   - Once the storage is expanded, boot into the Ubuntu VM and use a tool like `resize2fs` to extend the filesystem to use the newly available space:
     ```bash
     sudo resize2fs /dev/sdX
     ```
     *(Replace `/dev/sdX` with the actual disk identifier for your setup)*

5. **Reboot the VM** to apply the changes.

### **Ensuring Stability for Home Assistant (VM 101):**
- **Memory**: Leave **9.77-12 GB** of RAM allocated to Home Assistant.
- **CPU**: Keep **2 cores** assigned to Home Assistant.

### **Conclusion:**
With this setup, your **Ubuntu VM** will have increased capacity for future workloads (18 GB RAM, 2 cores, 2 TB storage), while still leaving enough room for Home Assistant to function without performance issues. You can adjust these values further based on how each VM performs over time.
