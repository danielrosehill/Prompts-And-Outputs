Current VM utilisation:
![[Reprovisioning Ubuntu VM for minimal resources-1.png]]
From the image, I can see that your **Ubuntu VM** is currently using:

- **0.46% of 4 CPU(s)**
- **7.79% of 17.58 GiB RAM** (~1.37 GiB of memory in use)
- **1.95 TiB Bootdisk size**

This indicates that the VM is currently over-provisioned with resources, particularly **CPU** and **RAM**, as the usage is quite low relative to the allocation.

### Recommendations for Resource Reduction:
Based on the current utilization, you can safely reduce both **CPU** and **RAM** allocations without negatively impacting performance, especially for a VM running lightweight or infrequently used services.

#### 1. **Reduce CPU Allocation**:
Since your CPU usage is very low, you could reduce the allocated CPU cores from 4 to **1 or 2 cores**.

**Steps to Reduce CPU**:
1. In the Proxmox web UI, select your **Ubuntu VM**.
2. Go to the **Hardware** tab.
3. Click on **Processors**.
4. Change the number of cores to **1 or 2** depending on your needs.
5. Click **OK** and **reboot the VM** to apply the changes.

#### 2. **Reduce RAM Allocation**:
The VM is using only around 1.37 GiB of RAM out of the allocated 17.58 GiB. You can reduce the allocated RAM to something closer to the current usage, like **2 or 4 GiB**, depending on the services running inside the VM.

**Steps to Reduce RAM**:
1. In the Proxmox web UI, select your **Ubuntu VM**.
2. Go to the **Hardware** tab.
3. Click on **Memory**.
4. Set the memory allocation to **2 GiB** (or **4 GiB** if you want to leave a buffer).
5. Click **OK** and **reboot the VM** to apply the changes.

#### 3. **Consider Disk Space (Optional)**:
If the VM isn't actually using the full **1.95 TiB** of disk space, you may also want to reduce the disk size. However, reducing disk size involves more complex steps such as shrinking partitions and filesystems, and it depends on how much storage is actually in use.

To check how much disk space is actually used inside the VM:
- SSH into the VM or use the Proxmox console and run:
  ```bash
  df -h
  ```

This will give you a better idea of whether the allocated disk size is excessive.

### Next Steps:
1. Reduce **CPU** and **RAM** allocation first, as this will yield the most immediate improvement in resource usage.
2. Monitor the performance after making these changes to ensure the VM still runs efficiently.
3. Optionally, you can explore reducing disk space if necessary based on actual usage.
