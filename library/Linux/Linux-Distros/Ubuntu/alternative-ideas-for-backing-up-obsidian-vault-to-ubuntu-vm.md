# Prompt

Great. Remember that the vault is on B2. Do you think that the approach you've suggested makes sense or might we be able to simplify it by using a backup program that's already configured to handle jobs like thisS?

# Output

Since your **Obsidian vault** is already stored in **Backblaze B2**, using a backup program that natively supports B2 can simplify the process considerably. Instead of using a custom script, you can leverage backup solutions that are specifically designed to handle incremental backups, scheduled tasks, and retention policies. This approach would reduce manual setup and provide built-in features for encryption, retention, and logging.

### Suggested Backup Tools:

#### **1. Rclone**
- **Why Use It**: 
  - **Rclone** is an open-source command-line program that can easily handle B2, automating incremental backups, and versioning. It's very well-suited for syncing and copying files between your local system and cloud storage.
  - **Simplifies the Process**: It can handle both your nightly syncs and weekly snapshot creation in one tool.
- **Configuration**:
  - You can set up **Rclone** to pull the latest version of your Obsidian vault from B2 into a local folder (like `/vaultreplica`) on a nightly basis.
  - You can also configure it to create weekly snapshots, with timestamped backups stored locally.
  - Rclone supports **retention policies** to automatically keep only the last 5 snapshots, removing the need for manual deletion.
- **How to Automate**:
  - You can use **cron** to automate Rclone tasks in the same way as with the custom script, but this method would be more robust as Rclone handles cloud storage nuances.

##### Example Rclone Setup:
1. Install Rclone and configure it with B2:
   ```bash
   rclone config
   ```
   Follow the steps to set up your B2 bucket.

2. Set up nightly sync:
   ```bash
   rclone sync b2:bucket_name /path/to/vaultreplica --b2-versions
   ```

3. Set up a weekly snapshot:
   ```bash
   rclone copy b2:bucket_name /path/to/snapshots/vault_$(date +%d%m%y).tar.gz
   ```

4. Retain only the last 5 snapshots:
   ```bash
   find /path/to/snapshots -type f -name "*.tar.gz" | sort | head -n -5 | xargs rm -f
   ```

#### **2. Duplicacy**
- **Why Use It**:
  - **Duplicacy** is a cloud-centric backup tool that natively supports **Backblaze B2** and is designed to handle incremental backups, snapshots, and retention policies.
  - It offers an easy-to-use web interface, ideal for users who prefer less command-line management.
  - It supports **deduplication**, **encryption**, and can handle large vaults efficiently.
  
- **How It Works**:
  - You can schedule automatic nightly incremental backups and weekly snapshots with Duplicacy, which also supports retention policies to keep only a certain number of backups.

- **How to Set Up**:
  - Install Duplicacy on your Ubuntu VM.
  - Configure it to back up from **B2** to a local directory (`/vaultreplica`) on a nightly basis.
  - Schedule weekly full snapshots and set the retention to only keep the last 5 snapshots.
  
#### **3. Restic**
- **Why Use It**:
  - **Restic** is a fast, secure, and easy-to-use backup tool that also supports **B2**. It's optimized for secure backups, providing **end-to-end encryption** and efficient storage management.
  - **Restic** supports features like automatic pruning (retaining a set number of backups) and built-in snapshotting.
  
- **How It Works**:
  - Like the other tools, Restic can be configured to pull backups from B2 and store them locally, or take scheduled snapshots and automatically manage retention.

### Recommendations:

#### **Simplified Approach Using Rclone**:
If youâ€™re comfortable with **Rclone**, this tool gives you the flexibility you need, with less setup than a custom script. It integrates smoothly with B2, and by adding simple automation via **cron**, it can manage your nightly incremental sync and weekly snapshot tasks effectively.

#### **Duplicacy for User-Friendliness**:
If you prefer a more automated, GUI-driven tool, **Duplicacy** provides a polished interface and full automation without needing detailed scripting. This could save you time in the long run and requires less manual intervention.

### Final Recommendation:
- **For maximum flexibility with minimal complexity**, I would recommend **Rclone** as your primary tool for syncing your Obsidian vault from B2, as it directly integrates with your current setup and requires minimal changes to your workflow.
- If you prefer a GUI solution with more backup-specific features, **Duplicacy** would simplify the backup process and provide an intuitive experience for managing your vault backups and retention policies.
