Yes, you can configure a dedicated "vault" folder on your Ubuntu server for storing backups and set it up as an NFS share with a separate local IP address. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

### Step 1: Create a Dedicated Network Interface (Optional)
To give the "vault" a separate IP address, you can configure an additional network interface or set up an alias IP on the existing network interface.

1. **Add a New IP Alias**:
   - Edit the Netplan configuration file (assuming Ubuntu uses Netplan):
     ```bash
     sudo nano /etc/netplan/01-netcfg.yaml
     ```
   - Add a new IP alias under your existing network interface:
     ```yaml
     network:
       version: 2
       ethernets:
         enp0s3:
           dhcp4: true
           addresses:
             - 192.168.1.5/24
             - 192.168.1.10/24  # Add this line for the new IP address
     ```
   - Apply the configuration:
     ```bash
     sudo netplan apply
     ```
2. **Verify the New IP Address**:
   ```bash
   ip addr show
   ```

### Step 2: Install and Configure NFS on the Ubuntu Server
1. **Install NFS Server**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install nfs-kernel-server
   ```

2. **Create the "Vault" Directory**:
   ```bash
   sudo mkdir -p /mnt/backup-vault
   sudo chown nobody:nogroup /mnt/backup-vault
   ```

3. **Configure NFS Exports**:
   - Edit the NFS exports file:
     ```bash
     sudo nano /etc/exports
     ```
   - Add the following line to export the "vault" directory over NFS:
     ```bash
     /mnt/backup-vault 192.168.1.0/24(rw,sync,no_subtree_check)
     ```
     - This allows read-write access from any machine in the `192.168.1.x` network.
     - Adjust the permissions and network range as needed.

4. **Restart NFS Services**:
   ```bash
   sudo exportfs -a
   sudo systemctl restart nfs-kernel-server
   ```

### Step 3: Configure the Fedora Client to Access the NFS Share
1. **Install NFS Client**:
   ```bash
   sudo dnf install nfs-utils
   ```

2. **Mount the NFS Share**:
   - Create a mount point on your Fedora machine:
     ```bash
     sudo mkdir -p /mnt/backup-vault
     ```
   - Add the following line to `/etc/fstab` to automatically mount the NFS share:
     ```bash
     192.168.1.10:/mnt/backup-vault /mnt/backup-vault nfs defaults 0 0
     ```
   - Mount the NFS share:
     ```bash
     sudo mount -a
     ```

### Step 4: Use the NFS Share for Backups
With the NFS share mounted on your Fedora system, you can now direct your backup tools (e.g., Veeam Agent, Duplicati, or BorgBackup) to use `/mnt/backup-vault` as the backup destination.

### Step 5: Additional Tips for Ease of Backup
- **Network Segmentation**: You can configure your network to ensure the backup IP (`192.168.1.10`) is reachable only for backup purposes, adding security.
- **Permissions**: Ensure the correct permissions on `/mnt/backup-vault` to prevent unauthorized access. You can restrict specific IP addresses or hostnames in `/etc/exports`.

### Verification
- Check NFS server status:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl status nfs-kernel-server
  ```
- Verify if the NFS share is correctly mounted on Fedora:
  ```bash
  df -h | grep backup-vault
  ```

### Benefits:
- **Dedicated Backup IP**: Using a separate IP makes it easier to manage backups and provides flexibility for network configurations or backup routing.
- **Centralized Storage**: The NFS share can act as a centralized backup destination, accessible by multiple machines if needed.
- **Easy Management**: NFS is straightforward to set up and works seamlessly across Linux systems.

By setting up an NFS share with a dedicated IP address, you gain flexibility, centralized storage, and streamlined access for backups across your network.
