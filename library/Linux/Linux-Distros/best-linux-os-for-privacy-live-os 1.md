**Summary of the prompt:** You are asking for the best Linux live OS currently available for privacy and security, particularly for use on **untrusted machines**.

The following are the **top Linux live operating systems** designed with **privacy**, **security**, and **anonymity** in mind. These are perfect for using on **untrusted machines** because they do not leave any traces on the host system and provide enhanced protection against surveillance and tracking.

### **1. Tails (The Amnesic Incognito Live System)**

**Tails** is considered one of the best Linux live OSes for privacy and anonymity. It is specifically designed to run from a USB stick or DVD, providing a highly secure environment that leaves no trace on the machine after use.

#### **Key Features**:
- **Tor Network**: All internet traffic is routed through the **Tor network**, ensuring anonymous browsing and communications.
- **No Data Persistence**: By default, Tails does not store data on the machine, which ensures nothing is left behind after you shut down the session.
- **Encryption Tools**: Built-in tools like **GnuPG**, **VeraCrypt**, and **LUKS** allow you to encrypt files and communications.
- **Temporary Memory Usage**: Tails runs entirely in **RAM**, so all information is wiped when you shut it down.
- **Pre-installed Privacy Tools**: Includes **Tor Browser**, **Thunderbird** with **OpenPGP**, **KeePassXC**, and **MAT** (Metadata Anonymization Toolkit).

#### **Why It’s Best for Privacy**:
- **Comprehensive Anonymity**: All internet activities go through **Tor**, which hides your IP address and anonymizes your traffic.
- **Live Environment**: No data is written to the disk by default unless you enable persistent storage on an encrypted partition.
- **Community Trusted**: Tails is widely regarded in the privacy community and recommended by organizations like the **Tor Project** and **Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)**.

#### **Use Case**:
Ideal for users who need **high privacy and anonymity**, especially when accessing the web on untrusted or public machines.

### **2. Qubes OS**

**Qubes OS** takes a different approach by focusing on **security through compartmentalization**. It uses a concept called **security by isolation**, where different activities are separated into virtualized domains or "qubes."

#### **Key Features**:
- **Security Through Isolation**: Each application or task runs in its own isolated virtual environment (qube), reducing the risk of one compromised application affecting others.
- **Disposable VMs**: You can create **disposable virtual machines** for one-time use, which are destroyed after closing, ensuring no persistence.
- **Tor and Whonix Integration**: Qubes can integrate with **Whonix**, which uses Tor for anonymous internet access, similar to Tails.
- **Strict Data Separation**: Sensitive tasks like internet browsing, emailing, and document viewing are all isolated into separate domains.

#### **Why It’s Best for Privacy**:
- **Isolation**: Applications and processes are isolated from each other, which helps protect against attacks.
- **Disposable VMs**: Using disposable environments prevents any traces from being left behind on untrusted machines.
- **Integration with Whonix**: You can run Whonix on Qubes to route traffic through Tor, combining Qubes’ security model with Tor’s anonymity.

#### **Use Case**:
Best for users who need **high security and isolation** for different tasks, such as handling sensitive documents while also browsing the web.

### **3. Whonix**

**Whonix** is a privacy-focused operating system that uses **virtual machines** to ensure anonymity. It’s designed to work with **Qubes OS** or any virtualization platform like **VirtualBox** or **KVM**.

#### **Key Features**:
- **Two Virtual Machines Setup**: Whonix splits your system into two VMs:
  - **Whonix-Gateway**: Routes all your traffic through **Tor**.
  - **Whonix-Workstation**: Isolated from the internet except through the **Whonix-Gateway**, ensuring that even if compromised, your real IP is never leaked.
- **Complete Tor Integration**: All communications are routed through the **Tor network**, making Whonix a powerful tool for anonymous browsing and communication.
- **High Security**: Whonix ensures that your actual IP address is never exposed, thanks to the separation of gateway and workstation.

#### **Why It’s Best for Privacy**:
- **Advanced Anonymity**: Combines Tor with complete network isolation.
- **VM-Based Security**: Even if a virtual machine is compromised, the rest of the system remains secure.

#### **Use Case**:
Perfect for users who want **strong anonymity** via Tor combined with **virtualization-based isolation**.

### **4. TENS (Trusted End Node Security)**

**TENS** is a Linux-based live OS developed by the **U.S. Department of Defense**. It's designed to run on untrusted systems, ensuring a high level of security for users who need to access sensitive information.

#### **Key Features**:
- **Run Entirely from RAM**: Like Tails, TENS runs entirely from RAM, and no data is written to the local disk, ensuring no traces are left behind.
- **Certified for Security**: It’s used by government agencies and is **certified by the U.S. Department of Defense**.
- **Public and Lite Versions**: The public version (TENS Public) is available for free, providing essential security tools.
- **Built-In Encryption**: Includes built-in encryption and secure communication tools to protect data during use.

#### **Why It’s Best for Privacy**:
- **High Level of Trust**: Developed and maintained by the U.S. Department of Defense, it's trusted for handling sensitive information.
- **No Data Retention**: Since it runs entirely in RAM, no data is left behind after use.

#### **Use Case**:
Great for users who want a **highly secure, government-certified OS** for working on **untrusted machines**.

### **5. Kali Linux (With Privacy Tools)**

**Kali Linux** is a popular Linux distribution used primarily for **penetration testing** and **security auditing**, but it also includes a suite of tools designed for **privacy** and **anonymity**.

#### **Key Features**:
- **Built-In Privacy Tools**: Includes tools like **Tor**, **Metasploit**, **OpenVPN**, and **secure tunneling** applications.
- **Live Boot**: Can be run as a **live OS** from USB, without leaving traces on the machine.
- **Encrypted Persistence**: Allows you to save data and configurations securely using an **encrypted persistence partition**.
- **Forensics Mode**: Offers a mode that ensures no changes are made to the system’s hard disk, making it safe for use on untrusted machines.

#### **Why It’s Best for Privacy**:
- **Versatile Privacy Tools**: Kali is equipped with many privacy and security tools out of the box.
- **Customizable**: If you're familiar with security tools, you can customize it to meet your specific privacy needs.

#### **Use Case**:
Perfect for users who need **both privacy** and **penetration testing** tools, such as security professionals or those who need to analyze network security while remaining anonymous.
