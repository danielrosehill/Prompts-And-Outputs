# Prompt

Can you think of data visualisation tools that can run on OpenSUSE and which may be useful in analysing or mining this dataset?

Only suggest desktop software

For each recommendations, provide instructions on how to install - and whether it's better to install it as a system package or in Anaconda

# Output

Here are several desktop data visualization tools that can run on OpenSUSE and are useful for analyzing or mining datasets. I have provided installation instructions and recommendations on whether to install them via system packages or Anaconda.

## 1. SciDAVis

SciDAVis is an interactive application designed for data analysis and publication-quality plotting. It is scriptable and can be extended with Python, making it a versatile tool for scientific data visualization.

### Installation on OpenSUSE:

- **System Package**: It is available in the official OpenSUSE repositories, so it's best to install it as a system package.

  **Command**:
  ```bash
  sudo zypper install scidavis
  ```

### Why use system package?

SciDAVis is well-supported in OpenSUSE’s repositories, and installing it via the package manager ensures that dependencies are handled automatically and updates are managed by the system\[4].

## 2. ParaView

ParaView is a powerful open-source tool designed for large-scale data analysis and visualization. It supports a wide range of data formats and can handle complex datasets, making it ideal for scientific computing.

### Installation on OpenSUSE:

- **System Package**: ParaView is available in the official repositories of OpenSUSE, making it easy to install as a system package.

  **Command**:
  ```bash
  sudo zypper install paraview
  ```

### Why use system package?

ParaView is optimized for performance on various platforms, including OpenSUSE. Installing it via the system package manager ensures that you get a version tailored for your distribution, with automatic updates\[5].

## 3. Gephi

Gephi is an open-source graph visualization platform that excels in network analysis. It allows users to explore large datasets through interactive visualizations, making it useful for social network analysis, biological networks, and more.

### Installation on OpenSUSE:

- **System Package**: Gephi is not available in the default OpenSUSE repositories but can be installed manually by downloading the Linux version from the official Gephi website.

  **Instructions**:
  1. Download the latest Linux package from [Gephi's website](https://gephi.org/).
  2. Extract the downloaded file.
  3. Navigate to the extracted folder and run the `gephi` script:
     ```bash
     ./bin/gephi
     ```

### Why manual installation?

Since Gephi is not available in the official repositories, manual installation ensures you get the latest version directly from the developers\[1].

## 4. VTK (Visualization Toolkit)

VTK is a comprehensive visualization library used for 3D computer graphics, image processing, and visualization. It supports numerous algorithms and is highly extensible via Python.

### Installation on OpenSUSE:

- **Anaconda**: While VTK can be installed using system packages, Anaconda provides a more flexible environment for working with Python-based scripts and libraries like VTK.

  **Command (in Anaconda)**:
  ```bash
  conda install -c anaconda vtk
  ```

### Why use Anaconda?

VTK integrates well with Python workflows, especially when using Jupyter notebooks or other Python-based tools. Anaconda simplifies managing dependencies and provides an isolated environment\[1].

## 5. Plotly

Plotly is an open-source graphing library that supports interactive plots in Python. It’s ideal for creating web-based visualizations but also works well on desktop environments through Jupyter notebooks or standalone scripts.

### Installation on OpenSUSE:

- **Anaconda**: Plotly is best installed through Anaconda since it integrates seamlessly with Python environments.

  **Command (in Anaconda)**:
  ```bash
  conda install -c plotly plotly
  ```

### Why use Anaconda?

Plotly's strength lies in its ability to work within Python environments like Jupyter notebooks. Anaconda provides all necessary dependencies in one place without affecting your system's Python installation\[3].

## Summary Table

| Tool     | Recommended Installation Method | Reason                                                         |
| -------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SciDAVis | System Package                  | Available in official repositories; easy maintenance           |
| ParaView | System Package                  | Optimized for performance; available in official repositories  |
| Gephi    | Manual Installation             | Not in official repos; manual download ensures latest version  |
| VTK      | Anaconda                        | Best suited for Python workflows; easier dependency management |
| Plotly   | Anaconda                        | Integrates well with Python; ideal for Jupyter notebooks       |

These tools offer a variety of features suitable for different types of data analysis and visualization tasks on OpenSUSE systems. Depending on your workflow (Python-heavy or standalone), you can choose between system packages or Anaconda installations to best suit your needs.
