Yes, on Fedora (as well as many other Linux distributions), the **Super key** typically refers to the key that has the **Windows logo** on it. While it's often referred to as the "Windows key" on keyboards, in Linux environments like Fedora, it's commonly called the **Super key** to keep things platform-neutral.

So, on most keyboards, the **Super key** is indeed the one with the **Windows logo**. You can use this key for various shortcuts in the desktop environment (e.g., Super + L to lock the screen, Super to open the application menu in GNOME, etc.).
