# Prompt

I frequently require the same few linux commands but it's hard to remember them all sometimes. is there something like a command library that you can keep  reference of all your most used commands?

# Output

Yes, you can create a **command library** using a few methods in Linux to store and reference your most-used commands easily. Here are some options:

### 1. **Alias Commands (for frequently used commands)**
   - You can create shortcuts for commands you use often by adding them to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     alias mycommand='sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade'
     ```
   - This way, you can call your frequently used commands with short aliases.

### 2. **Custom Command Library Script**
   - You can create a simple script that holds all your frequently used commands:
     ```bash
     #!/bin/bash
     echo "Most used commands:"
     echo "1. Command A: sudo systemctl restart apache2"
     echo "2. Command B: dmesg | grep error"
     ```
   - Save this as `mycommands.sh`, make it executable, and run it to list your commands.

### 3. **Use a Text File as a Command Reference**
   - Create a text file (e.g., `~/command_library.txt`) where you store your most-used commands. You can open this file with a quick command:
     ```bash
     cat ~/command_library.txt
     ```

### 4. **Use `tldr` (Simplified Man Pages)**
   - The `tldr` command provides simplified versions of man pages, summarizing commonly used commands for many Linux tools.
   - Install it with:
     ```bash
     sudo dnf install tldr
     ```
   - Example usage:
     ```bash
     tldr tar
     ```
   - This will give you a concise overview of commonly used `tar` commands.

### 5. **Use `Bash History` Effectively**
   - You can search your command history with:
     ```bash
     history | grep command
     ```
   - To quickly repeat a past command:
     ```bash
     !<command_number>
     ```

### 6. **Bookmarking with `Ctrl-R`**
   - Use `Ctrl + R` in your terminal to search for previous commands interactively.

These methods should make it easier for you to keep track of and access your frequently used Linux commands!
