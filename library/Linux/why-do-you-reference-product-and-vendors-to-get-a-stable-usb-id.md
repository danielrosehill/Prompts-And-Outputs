The changing **Device ID** each time you plug in your **Stream Deck Mini** is a common characteristic of how USB devices are managed by Linux. The **Bus Number** and **Device ID** are dynamically assigned by the USB controller whenever a device is plugged in. However, the **Vendor ID** and **Product ID** stay the same, which means there are ways to work around this behavior if consistency is needed.

### **Why Does the Device ID Change?**
- The **Device ID** changes every time the device is connected or the system restarts because it’s assigned sequentially by the USB bus, depending on the order in which devices are detected.
- The **Bus** and **Device IDs** are intended to uniquely identify a device during the current session but are not persistent across reboots or reconnections.
  
### **Should You Make the ID Consistent?**
The changing **Device ID** isn’t usually a problem because most tools use the **Vendor ID** (`idVendor`) and **Product ID** (`idProduct`) to interact with USB devices, which are static for a particular device type. However, in certain cases where you are writing custom scripts or udev rules, a consistent identifier can make it easier to manage or automate tasks.

Instead of trying to make the **Bus/Device ID** consistent (which isn't straightforward and may not be necessary), there are more practical methods to ensure consistent device management:

### **Alternative Ways to Manage Consistency**

1. **Use Persistent Identifiers (Vendor ID and Product ID)**
   - The best way to interact with the **Stream Deck** consistently is by referencing its **Vendor ID (`0fd9`)** and **Product ID (`0063`)**.
   - In `udev` rules or in scripts, these identifiers do not change, so they provide a reliable way to reference the device.

   Example of accessing the device by Vendor/Product ID:
   ```bash
   lsusb | grep "0fd9:0063"
   ```
   
2. **Create a Persistent Udev Rule for Device Path**
   - You can create a **udev rule** that assigns a static symlink in `/dev` whenever the **Stream Deck Mini** is connected. This way, you can always reference it using the same symlink, regardless of its dynamic Device ID.
   
   Example:
   - Create a rule to assign a static symlink (`/dev/streamdeck`) to your device.
   - Create or modify the rule in `/etc/udev/rules.d/70-streamdeck.rules`:
     ```bash
     sudo nano /etc/udev/rules.d/70-streamdeck.rules
     ```
     Add the following line:
     ```bash
     SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0fd9", ATTRS{idProduct}=="0063", SYMLINK+="streamdeck"
     ```
   - **Reload udev rules** and **trigger**:
     ```bash
     sudo udevadm control --reload
     sudo udevadm trigger
     ```
   - Now you can always reference the device using `/dev/streamdeck` instead of relying on the dynamic ID.

3. **Identify by Serial Number (if Available)**
   - Some USB devices, like certain versions of Stream Deck, might have a **unique serial number** that you can use to identify them consistently. You can check if your device has one using `udevadm`:
     ```bash
     sudo udevadm info -a -n /dev/bus/usb/001/011
     ```
   - Look for an attribute like `ATTRS{serial}`. If a serial number is present, you can add it to your udev rules for more specificity.

4. **Use UUID or Persistent Name in Scripts**
   - Instead of referring to `/dev/bus/usb/...` paths, you can use `/dev/serial/by-id/` or `/dev/usb/` paths that are automatically generated and linked based on device attributes like vendor, product, or serial numbers.

### **Advantages of Consistency**
- **Automation**: If you write automation scripts or udev rules that need to reference the Stream Deck Mini, having a **persistent identifier** ensures that your scripts work seamlessly every time, regardless of the order in which devices are connected.
- **Ease of Access**: Having a static symlink like `/dev/streamdeck` simplifies accessing the device in scripts or software that interacts with it.
- **Troubleshooting**: It’s easier to troubleshoot when you always know where the device will be located.

### **Conclusion**
It’s generally not feasible to prevent the **Device ID** from changing, as it’s part of how USB management works. However, using **persistent identifiers** like the **Vendor ID**, **Product ID**, and potentially a **serial number** in **udev rules** is a more efficient approach. Creating a **udev rule** to assign a static symlink is often the simplest and most reliable method to ensure consistent referencing of the Stream Deck Mini.
