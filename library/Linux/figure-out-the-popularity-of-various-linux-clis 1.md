# Prompt

Is there any way to know how popular various Linux CLIs are? Chattr seems amazing! Do many people use it and know about it?

# Output

Assessing the popularity of various Linux CLI tools, such as **chattr**, can be challenging as they are often part of the toolbox for more experienced users and system administrators. While no central source provides direct usage statistics for specific Linux CLI commands, there are a few indicators of how widely a tool like `chattr` is known and used:

### 1. **Community Discussions & Tutorials**
- **Forums and Q&A Sites**: Platforms like **Stack Overflow** and **Ask Ubuntu** often indicate how well-known a tool is based on how frequently it is discussed. **Chattr** is a common topic in system administration discussions, especially when protecting files or directories from accidental modification or deletion. 
- **Tutorials and Guides**: There are numerous blog posts and tutorials about **chattr**, which suggests that it’s a known tool, but probably more among system administrators and experienced Linux users than the general Linux community. For example, many tutorials on securing critical files recommend using `chattr +i` to prevent accidental deletion.

### 2. **GitHub Repositories and Open Source Projects**
- While **chattr** itself is part of the **ext4 file system** utilities and not a standalone open-source project, many sysadmins document using it in automation scripts, backup workflows, and file protection strategies within repositories.
  
### 3. **Package Popularity in Linux Distros**
- Popularity metrics for system tools are harder to track because `chattr` comes pre-installed with Linux distributions that use the **ext2, ext3, or ext4 file systems**. It is not a standalone package, so usage metrics from package managers like APT or Yum don’t directly apply.
  
### 4. **Sysadmin and DevOps Tools**
- Tools like **Ansible** or **SaltStack** (automation tools) often reference `chattr` for making files immutable in infrastructure management scripts. These references in automation playbooks suggest it's a well-known tool in system administration and DevOps communities.

### 5. **Ranking Among Other Tools**
- **chattr** is not as widely known or as frequently used as some other basic Linux commands like `rm`, `cp`, or `chmod`, but it's highly valued in specific use cases. It’s popular among system administrators who need to secure critical files or protect configuration directories.

### Conclusion
While `chattr` isn’t as widely used as mainstream Linux utilities, it's a vital part of the sysadmin toolkit for those working with file security and protection on **ext2/3/4 file systems**. Its usage is more niche, aimed at file protection, and is well-known among experienced Linux users rather than beginners.

If you're interested in specific usage metrics for Linux CLI tools in general, there are community-driven surveys and reports, such as the **Stack Overflow Developer Survey**, which sometimes capture insights into which tools and commands are most frequently used.
