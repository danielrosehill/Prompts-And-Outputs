# Prompt

Is it possible to run these commands in a way that they are automatically pasted onto my clipboard (the output)

# Output

Yes, it's definitely possible to run these commands and automatically copy their output to your clipboard, though the approach will depend on your environment (Linux desktop, SSH client, or using terminal multiplexers like tmux).

Below are some ways to achieve this:

### **1. On Your Local Linux Machine (with `xclip` or `xsel`):**
If you're accessing the Proxmox mini PC via SSH from a Linux desktop, you can redirect the command output to the clipboard using tools like `xclip` or `xsel`.

First, install `xclip` or `xsel` on your local machine:
```bash
sudo apt install xclip
```
or
```bash
sudo apt install xsel
```

Then, you can modify the command to send its output to your clipboard. For example:
```bash
ssh root@192.168.1.2 "lscpu" | xclip -selection clipboard
```
This command will:
1. SSH into the mini PC.
2. Run the `lscpu` command.
3. Pipe (`|`) the output into `xclip` to copy it to your clipboard.

### **2. Using `tmux` to Capture Output:**
If you're using **tmux** as your terminal multiplexer, you can use its copy-mode to copy text to your clipboard. First, start a tmux session and SSH into your mini PC. To copy the output:

1. Press `Ctrl-b` then `[` to enter copy mode.
2. Navigate to the start of the text you want to copy, then press `Space` to start selecting.
3. Navigate to the end of the text, and press `Enter` to copy it.
4. You can then use `xclip` or `xsel` to copy the text to your system clipboard.

### **3. Using `pbcopy` (macOS):**
If you’re running macOS and SSH into the mini PC, you can use `pbcopy`:
```bash
ssh root@192.168.1.2 "lscpu" | pbcopy
```
This will copy the output to your macOS clipboard.

### **4. Clipboard Tools like `wl-copy` or `xclip` for Wayland (Fedora with Wayland):**
If you're running Fedora with Wayland, you may need to use `wl-copy`:
```bash
sudo dnf install wl-clipboard
```
Then:
```bash
ssh root@192.168.1.2 "lscpu" | wl-copy
```

### **5. Storing in a File First and Copying from the File:**
If you want to save the output to a file first and then copy the content:
```bash
ssh root@192.168.1.2 "lscpu" > output.txt
cat output.txt | xclip -selection clipboard
```

### **6. Using VS Code or Other IDEs with Remote SSH Capabilities:**
If you use **Visual Studio Code** with the **Remote - SSH** extension:
- You can SSH into the mini PC and run commands directly in VS Code’s terminal.
- Then you can simply highlight the output, right-click, and select "Copy" to get it onto your clipboard.

### **Summary:**
- **Linux Desktop**: Use `xclip` or `xsel`.
- **macOS**: Use `pbcopy`.
- **Wayland on Fedora**: Use `wl-copy`.
- **tmux**: Use copy mode within tmux.
- **VS Code Remote SSH**: Run commands in VS Code and use native copy features.

These methods will make it easy to automate copying command outputs to your clipboard, depending on your system setup. Let me know which approach you prefer, and I can provide more specific guidance if needed!
