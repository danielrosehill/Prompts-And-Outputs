To summarize: you're asking if keeping your **NAS mounted permanently** on your Fedora system could cause any slowdown.

### Answer:
In most cases, **keeping a NAS permanently mounted** on your Fedora system **should not cause any significant slowdown** under normal conditions. However, there are some factors that could impact system performance, depending on the specific setup and usage. Here's a breakdown:

### Factors that Could Affect Performance:

1. **Network Speed and Latency**:
   - **LAN Speed**: If your NAS is connected over a fast network, such as **Gigabit Ethernet** or **10 Gbps LAN**, the performance impact is negligible. Slow or congested networks (like 100 Mbps Ethernet or Wi-Fi) could cause delays when accessing files or performing backups.
   - **Latency**: High latency can cause delays when the system needs to communicate with the NAS, but this will mostly affect access times for files on the NAS itself, not overall system performance.

2. **Mounting Overhead**:
   - **Idle Mount**: Simply having the NAS mounted will not consume significant resources as long as it's idle (i.e., not reading or writing data).
   - **Network Traffic**: If the NAS is accessed frequently (e.g., for file operations or backups), it could introduce network traffic that could marginally affect performance, but this impact is usually low on modern systems with good network infrastructure.

3. **File Access Delays**:
   - **Accessing NAS Files**: If you regularly access files stored on the NAS, performance will depend on the speed of your network connection to the NAS and the speed of the NAS itself (e.g., spinning hard drives vs. SSDs).
   - **System Files on NAS**: If critical system files or programs are located on the NAS, you might experience slowdowns when the system tries to access those files. It's best to keep system-critical files on local storage.

4. **Mount Options**:
   - **Mount Options**: Using appropriate **mount options** can help optimize performance. For example, enabling the `noatime` option can prevent unnecessary writes by stopping the system from updating file access times.
     Example:
     ```bash
     sudo mount -t nfs -o noatime 192.168.1.50:/volume1/danieldesktopbackups /mnt/nas
     ```
   - **Caching**: Some mount options (e.g., enabling caching) can improve performance when working with files over the network.

### Scenarios Where It May Impact Performance:
- **NAS Downtime**: If the NAS becomes unreachable (e.g., it goes offline or the network connection is disrupted), processes attempting to access the mounted NAS may hang or experience delays.
- **Heavy Usage**: If you’re running **I/O-heavy tasks** (e.g., large file transfers, backups, or media streaming) on the NAS while also using the local system, you might notice some impact depending on network and CPU usage.

### Recommendations:
- **Gigabit LAN** or better: Ensure you have at least a **Gigabit Ethernet** connection between your Fedora system and the NAS for optimal performance.
- **Use mount options**: Configure your mount options to optimize performance (`noatime`, `async`, etc.).
- **Avoid system-critical files on NAS**: Keep important system files on local storage to avoid delays.
- **Test Performance**: Monitor the performance with the NAS mounted for a while to see if you notice any impact on your workflows.

### Conclusion:
Keeping your **NAS permanently mounted** on your Fedora system should not significantly slow it down, especially if you’re using a fast, stable network connection like **Gigabit Ethernet**. Any slowdown will mostly depend on network traffic, the frequency of file access on the NAS, and potential downtime of the NAS. Using appropriate mount options can also help ensure the system remains performant.
