# Prompt

earlier, i created some systemd services in fedora. I can't remember where I put them. what's the directory and is there a gui for managing them?

# Output

Based on the information provided in the search results and standard Fedora practices, here's where cyou likely created your systemd services and how you can manage them:

1. Location of Custom Systemd Services:

The most likely location for your custom systemd services is:

```
/etc/systemd/system/
```

This is the recommended location for storing custom systemd unit files in Fedora and most other Linux distributions[1][2]. It takes precedence over other directories, allowing your custom services to override default ones if needed.

2. Checking for Your Services:

To list all the unit files installed on your system, including your custom ones, you can use this command in the terminal:

```
systemctl list-unit-files
```

This will show you all unit files, including those you've created[3].

3. GUI for Managing Systemd Services:

Fedora doesn't come with a built-in GUI specifically for managing systemd services. However, there are some third-party options you can consider:

- Cockpit: This is a web-based interface for managing Linux systems, including systemd services. It's officially supported by Fedora and can be installed with:
  ```
  sudo dnf install cockpit
  ```

- GNOME System Monitor: While not specifically for systemd, it can show running processes and services.

- SystemdGenie: This is a KDE-based GUI for managing systemd, but it's not in the official Fedora repositories. You'd need to install it from a third-party source.

4. Command-line Management:

While not a GUI, the `systemctl` command provides powerful management capabilities:

- To check the status of a service:
  ```
  systemctl status your-service-name.service
  ```

- To start/stop a service:
  ```
  sudo systemctl start/stop your-service-name.service
  ```

- To enable/disable a service at boot:
  ```
  sudo systemctl enable/disable your-service-name.service
  ```

Remember, for system-wide services, you'll need to use `sudo` with these commands.

If you can't find your services in `/etc/systemd/system/`, you might also check `/usr/lib/systemd/system/` or `/run/systemd/system/`, but these are less common locations for custom services[1][3].
