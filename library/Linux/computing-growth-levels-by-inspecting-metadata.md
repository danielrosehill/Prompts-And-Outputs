**Prompt Summary:** You asked if it's possible to analyze the growth in size of the output vault by inspecting the creation date metadata of Markdown files and then plotting this growth on a week-by-week basis.

### Approach to Analyzing Vault Growth Using File Metadata

Yes, it’s possible to extract the creation date metadata of Markdown files and use this information to compute the growth in the vault's size. We can achieve this by:

1. **Reading Metadata (Creation Dates):**
   - Extract the creation date of each Markdown file to determine when it was added to the vault.
   - You can use the file's metadata (`os.stat`) or specific metadata embedded in the file (if it has explicit creation timestamps).

2. **Calculate Weekly Growth:**
   - Group files based on their creation week.
   - Calculate the cumulative size of files over time to see how the vault has grown week by week.

3. **Generate a Growth Plot:**
   - Create a time-series plot showing the cumulative size of the vault on a weekly basis.

### Python Script for Weekly Growth Analysis

**Dependencies:**
```bash
pip install matplotlib pandas
```

**Script:**

```python
import os
from datetime import datetime
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def get_file_metadata(directory):
    # Collect metadata: file size and creation date
    file_data = []
    
    for root, _, files in os.walk(directory):
        for file in files:
            if file.endswith(".md"):
                file_path = os.path.join(root, file)
                
                # Get file metadata
                stat_info = os.stat(file_path)
                file_size = stat_info.st_size  # File size in bytes
                
                # Get creation time (c_time for Unix-like systems; may differ on Windows)
                creation_time = datetime.fromtimestamp(stat_info.st_ctime)
                
                file_data.append((file_size, creation_time))
    
    return file_data

def compute_weekly_growth(file_data):
    # Convert file data to a DataFrame
    df = pd.DataFrame(file_data, columns=["File Size", "Creation Date"])
    
    # Convert to week-based period
    df['Week'] = df['Creation Date'].dt.to_period('W')
    
    # Group by week and sum the file sizes to get cumulative sizes
    weekly_data = df.groupby('Week')['File Size'].sum().reset_index()
    
    # Calculate cumulative sum over time
    weekly_data['Cumulative Size (MB)'] = (weekly_data['File Size'].cumsum()) / (1024 * 1024)  # Convert to MB
    
    return weekly_data

def plot_growth(weekly_data):
    # Plot cumulative growth
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    plt.plot(weekly_data['Week'].astype(str), weekly_data['Cumulative Size (MB)'], marker='o', linestyle='-')
    plt.title("Growth of Output Vault Over Time (Week by Week)")
    plt.xlabel("Week")
    plt.ylabel("Cumulative Size (MB)")
    plt.grid(True)
    plt.xticks(rotation=45)
    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.savefig("vault_growth.png")
    plt.close()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Directory containing markdown files
    directory = "/home/daniel/Vaults/outputhub_vault/Output_Hub/Outputs"
    
    # Collect metadata from files
    file_data = get_file_metadata(directory)
    
    # Compute weekly growth
    weekly_data = compute_weekly_growth(file_data)
    
    # Plot and save growth
    plot_growth(weekly_data)
    
    print("Weekly growth analysis completed and plot generated.")
```

### Explanation:

1. **Collect File Metadata (`get_file_metadata`):**
   - Uses `os.stat` to retrieve the size and creation time of each Markdown file.
   - Stores the data as tuples of `(file size, creation date)`.

2. **Compute Weekly Growth (`compute_weekly_growth`):**
   - Converts file metadata into a Pandas DataFrame.
   - Groups the data by creation week and calculates the cumulative size of the vault week by week.
   - The sizes are converted to **MB** for easier reading.

3. **Generate and Save the Plot (`plot_growth`):**
   - Uses Matplotlib to create a time-series plot showing the cumulative size of the vault over time.
   - Saves the plot as `vault_growth.png`.

### Usage:
1. **Ensure Dependencies Are Installed:**
   - You’ll need `pandas` and `matplotlib` for data handling and visualization:
     ```bash
     pip install pandas matplotlib
     ```

2. **Run the Script:**
   ```bash
   python3 generate_vault_growth_report.py
   ```

3. **Inspect the Output:**
   - The script will generate a plot called `vault_growth.png` in the same directory as the script, showing how the vault has grown over time.

### Notes:
- **Cross-Platform Consideration:**
  - The method of getting file creation time (`os.stat().st_ctime`) may behave differently on Windows vs. Unix-like systems. On some Unix systems, `st_ctime` represents the last metadata change time, not the original creation date. 
  - If you have explicit metadata (e.g., in the file content or filenames), you may need to adjust the script to parse those instead.

- **Adjust Time Intervals:**
  - The script uses **weekly periods** by default. If you prefer monthly or daily, adjust the `dt.to_period('W')` line to `'M'` for monthly or `'D'` for daily.

### Conclusion
This script allows you to track the cumulative growth of your output vault by analyzing the size and creation dates of your Markdown files. By plotting the data on a weekly basis, you can visualize how the vault has grown over time, helping you understand trends in your content creation process. This approach is entirely local and does not require external APIs.
