# Prompt

Are TUIs being actively developed? I always assumed that the only ones that were around were legacy programs that were just being maintained by some enthusiasts?

# Output

Yes, **TUIs are actively developed**, and they are far from being just legacy tools maintained by enthusiasts. While some of the older TUIs that have been around for decades (like **Vim**, **Emacs**, **Midnight Commander**, etc.) continue to be actively maintained and have passionate user bases, there is a **thriving ecosystem** of **new** TUIs being developed, improved, and used in modern workflows.

### Why TUIs Are Still Relevant and Growing:
1. **Developer Productivity**: Many developers and system administrators work primarily in the terminal because it offers **speed, control, and minimalism**. TUIs integrate seamlessly into that workflow, allowing users to stay within the terminal for tasks ranging from file management and coding to system monitoring and communication.
   
2. **Remote Work**: With the rise of **remote work** and the need to manage remote systems, TUIs are perfect for use over **SSH** or in **headless environments**. You don’t need a graphical interface to be productive on a remote server; a good TUI can give you all the power you need.

3. **Customization and Extensibility**: TUIs are **highly customizable** and scriptable, which makes them attractive for power users who want to build highly efficient, personalized workflows. Many TUIs allow for extensive plugin support and integration with other tools.

4. **Simplicity and Focus**: For users who prefer minimalist, distraction-free interfaces, TUIs offer a clean alternative to bloated graphical interfaces. They can also be more accessible to users who have sensory sensitivities or prefer simpler interfaces.

### Why TUIs Are Being Actively Developed:
1. **Cloud Computing and DevOps**: As more developers and sysadmins work with **cloud infrastructure** and **containers** like **Kubernetes** (which often lacks GUIs in remote setups), TUIs provide a lightweight way to interact with these environments over SSH without the need for graphical interfaces.
   
2. **Rise of Minimalism**: Many modern developers are embracing **minimalist** workflows, often relying on **lightweight tools** that can run in low-resource environments. This has led to a resurgence of interest in TUIs, which offer simplicity and speed without the bloat of GUIs.

3. **Productivity and Focus**: TUIs reduce distractions, and for many power users, they streamline workflows by keeping everything in the same environment (the terminal). This reduces context-switching and increases focus.

4. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: TUIs are often cross-platform by nature, running on Linux, macOS, and Windows (via WSL). They’re attractive to developers who want their tools to work seamlessly across different environments.

### Conclusion:
Not only are TUIs being actively developed, but they are also **evolving** with modern needs. The ecosystem is **growing**, with both new and old projects gaining traction. Many TUIs now integrate with modern tools and workflows, making them highly relevant for cloud computing, DevOps, development, and system management. Enthusiasts, professionals, and power users alike continue to embrace TUIs for their speed, efficiency, and customization potential.
