Yes, it’s definitely possible to set up a feature that allows users to save ChatGPT outputs as markdown files in a terminal user interface (TUI). Here’s how you can approach this and whether it's better to start this as a feature request or create your own:

1. Setting This Up in an Existing Tool

If you’re already using a ChatGPT TUI tool like Bavarder or any other, you can explore the tool's GitHub repository to see if the project is open to contributions or feature requests.

Many open-source projects welcome feature suggestions from users. You can submit a feature request by opening an issue on their GitHub page, detailing the functionality you’d like (i.e., an option to save an output as a markdown file to a specific destination).

Some tools already offer basic saving functionality, but you can suggest adding a markdown-specific save feature with destination options and file naming conventions. For instance, it could be as simple as adding a command like :save <filename>.md.


2. Creating the Feature Yourself

If the tool is open source and you’re familiar with programming, you could implement this feature yourself by forking the repository and adding the functionality. It would involve intercepting the output from ChatGPT and writing it to a .md file.

If the tool is written in Python, for example, this could be done using basic file I/O operations to save the conversation to a markdown file. This would look something like this:

with open("output.md", "w") as file:
    file.write(output)

You can also provide users with the option to customize the save path or file name interactively.


3. Is It Better to Submit a Feature Request or Start a New Project?

Submit a Feature Request: If the TUI you’re using is widely used and has an active development community, submitting a feature request is probably the most efficient route. It saves you from having to reinvent the wheel, and the project maintainers may be eager to implement the feature if it’s useful to others.

Start a New Project or Fork: If you’re comfortable with coding or want more control over the feature's design, forking an existing tool or building your own TUI might be a rewarding experience. Starting from an existing codebase can help you learn and implement new features more efficiently.


Conclusion:

It’s definitely possible to add a feature that allows saving outputs as markdown files in a TUI. The best approach depends on your preference—if you're looking for a quick solution, a feature request is likely the way to go, but if you enjoy coding and want to customize it, implementing it yourself would give you full control.

I recommend starting by submitting a feature request to the existing tool if you don't want to code it from scratch, especially if the project has an active development community.
