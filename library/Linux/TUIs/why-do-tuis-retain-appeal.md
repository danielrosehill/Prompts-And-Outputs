# Prompt

I'm a bit of a latecomer to the TUI world but I think they have quite a cult following right? Is there a subreddit? And why do people like them? In the case of this RSS reader, I actually find it easier to read the news this way than on a crowded website. Perhaps it's got a connection to sensory stuff for people?

# Output

You're absolutely rightâ€”**TUIs (Text-based User Interfaces)** have a strong cult following, especially among Linux and Unix users, developers, sysadmins, and minimalists who enjoy working directly from the terminal. There is indeed a community of enthusiasts, and several subreddits and forums cater to this interest.

### Relevant Subreddits:
1. **r/commandline**: A popular subreddit focused on terminal and command-line tools, where TUIs often come up.
   - [r/commandline](https://www.reddit.com/r/commandline/)
   
2. **r/unixporn**: This subreddit showcases beautifully customized desktops and terminal setups. It often includes TUIs within terminal emulators that are highly customized for aesthetics.
   - [r/unixporn](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/)
   
3. **r/linux**: General discussion about Linux often involves TUI tools and workflows.
   - [r/linux](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/)

4. **r/terminal**: A smaller but dedicated subreddit focused on terminal environments, including TUIs.
   - [r/terminal](https://www.reddit.com/r/terminal/)

5. **r/tmux**: Specific to `tmux`, but often has discussions about TUIs that integrate well with terminal multiplexers.
   - [r/tmux](https://www.reddit.com/r/tmux/)

### Why Do People Like TUIs?

There are several reasons TUIs are beloved by many:

#### 1. **Speed and Efficiency**
   - **No mouse required**: Everything can be done using the keyboard, which can significantly speed up workflows for people who are comfortable with keyboard shortcuts.
   - **Minimal resource usage**: TUIs tend to be extremely lightweight compared to GUI applications, which makes them faster to load and run, especially on older or less powerful machines.
   - **Task automation**: Many TUI tools integrate well with shell scripts, enabling users to automate repetitive tasks.

#### 2. **Focus and Simplicity**
   - **Clutter-free environment**: TUIs generally provide a very minimal, distraction-free interface. This can help users focus on the task at hand, which is especially important for things like reading news or managing tasks.
   - **Sensory factors**: Some users, especially those sensitive to **visual clutter** or **overstimulation**, find TUIs more pleasant to use. TUIs strip away ads, pop-ups, and overwhelming visuals, making the experience more streamlined and less stressful.
   - In the case of **RSS readers**, like the one you're using, the content is often presented in a clean and readable format, without the distractions common on modern websites (ads, autoplaying videos, intrusive layouts). This aligns with your observation about **sensory** preferences.

#### 3. **Customizability**
   - **Full control**: TUIs are often more customizable than their GUI counterparts. Users can configure settings, modify keybindings, and script workflows to meet their exact needs.
   - **Aesthetics**: For some, customizing terminal environments and TUIs (with tools like `tmux`, `neovim`, `ranger`, etc.) is almost like an art form. Communities like **r/unixporn** showcase beautifully customized setups that focus heavily on the terminal.

#### 4. **Learning and Mastery**
   - **Power-users**: TUIs appeal to users who want to master their environment. Terminal users often feel more in control of their systems, and the deep integration of TUIs with shell environments makes them incredibly powerful once the user learns how to wield them.
   - **Unix philosophy**: Many TUIs embody the Unix philosophy of creating simple, modular tools that do one thing well and can be combined with other tools. For example, using **tmux** with an RSS reader like **Newsboat** to have a multi-pane news reading setup is very much in line with this philosophy.

#### 5. **Cross-Platform Consistency**
   - **Same interface across machines**: Because TUIs run in the terminal, they provide a consistent interface across different systems. Whether you're on Linux, macOS, or even Windows (via WSL or Cygwin), the TUI looks and behaves the same, making it a more portable solution for users who switch between environments.
   - **Remote access**: TUIs can be accessed over SSH, making them ideal for managing remote servers or systems without the need for a GUI. For instance, reading news with **Newsboat** via SSH is entirely possible.

### Sensory Connection
You're absolutely on point with the observation about TUIs and **sensory preferences**. For some users, a clean, text-based interface can feel far less overwhelming than a GUI filled with distracting elements like animations, videos, ads, and bright colors. Here's how TUIs relate to sensory processing:

- **Low cognitive load**: A TUI presents only the necessary information in a format that's simple and often monochrome, reducing the **cognitive load** and visual distractions.
- **Focus on content**: When using a TUI-based RSS reader, for instance, you're focused purely on the text of the articles, without the surrounding noise found on most websites.
- **Customizable aesthetics**: With TUIs, users can control **color schemes**, **font size**, and even the **density** of the information presented, tailoring the experience to fit their sensory needs. Many terminal emulators also allow for dark modes and fine-tuned color schemes that can reduce eye strain.

### Conclusion:
Yes, TUIs do have a **cult following** for good reasons: they offer speed, efficiency, focus, and customizability that GUIs often lack. Communities like **r/commandline**, **r/unixporn**, and **r/terminal** have helped foster this following, with users sharing tips, workflows, and customization ideas.

Your experience with **Newsboat** resonates with many people who find TUIs less cluttered and more conducive to focus. Whether it's for sensory reasons, productivity, or aesthetic preference, TUIs have a unique appeal that continues to grow in popularity.
