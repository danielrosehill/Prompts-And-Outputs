# Prompt

Can you think of any systems for organising and retrieving knowledge which might feel particularly intuitive to somebody like me (with ADHD). I am fascinated in many things. I explore countless subjects on ChatGPT and create many notes, not all of which are clearly related. This provides lots of fun, but whenit comes to trying to review and retrieve information I've stored, sometimes it's difficult to know where to even start. I have a good system in place for capturing the information I gather from GPT during my various research periods. what I'm lacking is a good way to visualise and retrieve that info in a way that makes it easier for me to follow up on the directions I've begun exploring. What are your thoughts? I'm open to exploring all tools

To make retrieving and reviewing information more intuitive, especially with ADHD, a system that visualizes information, shows connections, and allows easy exploration can be particularly beneficial. Here are a few systems and tools that align well with these goals:

### 1. **Networked Note-Taking Tools with Graph Visualization**
   - **Tools**: **Obsidian** (graph view), **Logseq**, **Roam Research**
   - **How it Works**: These tools create a graph view of your notes, showing them as interconnected nodes. This approach can help visualize all the different directions you've explored and how various ideas connect. You can focus on clusters of related ideas or explore across topics by following the links.
   - **Suggestions for Use**: Use tags to group related themes and regular review sessions to add links between related ideas. This way, you create a more connected network over time that can reveal patterns and help you recall paths you’ve explored.

### 2. **Zettelkasten (Slip-Box) System for Relational Connections**
   - **Tools**: **Obsidian** with the **Zettelkasten** method, or **RemNote** (which also has a spaced repetition feature)
   - **How it Works**: Zettelkasten encourages breaking down knowledge into “atomic” notes, each representing one idea, and connecting each idea to related notes. Rather than relying on folders, it builds relationships between individual ideas, creating a web that you can explore from any entry point.
   - **Suggestions for Use**: Start with “atomic” notes for each new idea and make liberal use of backlinks to related concepts. You can use a primary note (or “index”) for each main topic, linking to smaller, related notes for quick recall.

### 3. **Kanban Boards for Topic and Idea Tracking**
   - **Tools**: **Trello**, **Notion**, or **Obsidian Kanban plugin**
   - **How it Works**: A Kanban board helps you track the progress of topics, projects, or areas you’re exploring. You could set up columns like “New Ideas,” “In Progress,” “Needs Review,” and “Archived.” This format provides a snapshot of where your knowledge projects stand, making it easy to pick up where you left off.
   - **Suggestions for Use**: Use each card for a topic or question you’re exploring, and add relevant links, GPT outputs, or key takeaways. Moving cards across the board provides a structured view of where ideas are in your personal knowledge journey.

### 4. **Mind Maps for Topic Exploration and Concept Recall**
   - **Tools**: **Miro**, **XMind**, **MindNode**
   - **How it Works**: Mind mapping visually organizes ideas around central topics, connecting subtopics in a “tree” structure. It’s intuitive for non-linear thinkers and provides a clear overview of the main ideas you’re exploring and how they connect.
   - **Suggestions for Use**: Use mind maps to outline broad topics (like “Science Interests” or “Personal Development”) and map out specific questions or GPT-generated insights as branches. Mind maps can serve as visual “table of contents” for each topic area.

### 5. **Tag-Based Retrieval with Focused “Maps of Content”**
   - **Tools**: **Obsidian** or **Notion**
   - **How it Works**: Tags are assigned to notes based on topic, theme, or even the mood during creation. Then, a “Map of Content” note acts as an index for specific tags or themes, so you can retrieve related notes by theme rather than by searching or browsing folders.
   - **Suggestions for Use**: Develop “Map of Content” notes as topic hubs. For example, have one for “Ideas for Later,” another for “Research in Progress,” and others for specific subjects. These hubs become reliable starting points, making it easy to dive into related knowledge without getting lost in unrelated notes.

### 6. **Personal Knowledge Graphs**
   - **Tools**: **Kumu**, **TheBrain**, or **Heptabase**
   - **How it Works**: These tools create custom knowledge graphs, allowing you to visualize and group notes, insights, and resources in an interactive web. You can organize thoughts by linking related topics and adding visual cues for easy recognition.
   - **Suggestions for Use**: Use these tools to map out each topic you’re diving into and link related ideas and resources. Many have visualization and search features that can make rediscovering ideas intuitive, especially when you want to explore related topics.

### 7. **Digital Gardens for Iterative Knowledge Building**
   - **Tools**: **Obsidian** with backlinks and daily notes, **Notion**, or **TiddlyWiki**
   - **How it Works**: Digital gardens encourage you to cultivate knowledge over time by regularly revisiting and updating notes. Each “garden” entry evolves as you add more related information, rather than remaining static like traditional notes.
   - **Suggestions for Use**: Create entries for each idea or question you explore and update them periodically with new insights. This approach is ideal for evolving knowledge and maintaining active recall of topics as they grow.

### Tips for Implementing These Systems
   - **Set Regular Review Sessions**: For someone with ADHD, consistent reviews (e.g., weekly or monthly) can keep your notes fresh in mind and avoid overwhelm.
   - **Use Themes for Different “Moods” of Work**: For example, you could use a “review” theme for refining and organizing notes or an “exploration” theme for diving into new topics, tagging notes to help you shift focus depending on your mood.
   - **Experiment with Visual Reminders and Reminders**: Use images, icons, or colors to make important notes and paths of thought visually stand out, helping focus and encouraging return to ideas.

Exploring these visualization-driven systems could make your knowledge “second brain” both functional and enjoyable, keeping you motivated and improving retrieval by aligning with natural thought patterns.
