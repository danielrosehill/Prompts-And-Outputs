The **ChatGPT CLI (TUI)** project you linked to, [kardolus/chatgpt-cli](https://github.com/kardolus/chatgpt-cli), is a terminal user interface for interacting with ChatGPT via the command line. The project is built in **Go** and uses the **OpenAI API** to handle requests.

### How Difficult Would it Be to Fork and Add the Feature?

The difficulty of adding a feature for **saving outputs as Markdown** to a **custom directory** depends on your experience with **Go** and **file handling** in the language. Based on the code structure of this project, here’s a breakdown of the steps needed to implement the feature:

### 1. **Forking the Project**
   - Forking is relatively straightforward. You can simply click the **Fork** button on GitHub to create your own copy of the repository. You can then clone the fork to your local machine using:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/chatgpt-cli.git
     ```

### 2. **Adding the Markdown Saving Feature**

#### Steps to Implement the Feature:
   1. **Identify Where the Output is Generated**:
      - The core of this TUI involves making API requests to OpenAI and displaying the responses in the terminal. You’ll need to locate the part of the code where the **ChatGPT responses** are handled. Based on the structure of CLI tools, this is likely happening in a function that processes the API response and prints it to the terminal.

   2. **Add File Handling**:
      - Use **Go’s file handling** capabilities (`os` and `io` packages) to create or open a file, write the ChatGPT output in **Markdown format**, and save it to the desired directory.
      - Example Go code for saving a file:
        ```go
        package main

        import (
            "os"
        )

        func saveOutputToFile(output string, filename string) error {
            file, err := os.Create(filename) // Create a new file
            if err != nil {
                return err
            }
            defer file.Close()

            // Write the output to the file
            _, err = file.WriteString(output)
            if err != nil {
                return err
            }

            return nil
        }
        ```

   3. **Get the Output in Markdown Format**:
      - Convert the output to **Markdown format**. If the output is plain text, you can simply wrap it in standard Markdown syntax. For instance, if the response includes text that should be in code blocks or lists, format it accordingly.
      - Example:
        ```go
        func formatAsMarkdown(response string) string {
            return "### ChatGPT Response\n\n" + response
        }
        ```

   4. **Allow Custom Directory Selection**:
      - Provide an option for users to specify a **custom directory**. You can handle this by adding a flag to the command line interface, such as `--output-dir`.
      - Example using Go’s `flag` package:
        ```go
        import "flag"

        var outputDir string

        func init() {
            flag.StringVar(&outputDir, "output-dir", ".", "Directory to save markdown outputs")
            flag.Parse()
        }
        ```

   5. **Integrate With the Existing CLI**:
      - Modify the existing command structure in the CLI to accept this new flag and invoke the Markdown-saving function whenever output is generated.

### 3. **Testing and Customization**
   - Test the feature by running different queries and ensuring that the output is correctly saved as **Markdown** in the specified directory.
   - You can further customize the behavior, such as adding timestamps to the filenames or including metadata like the query that generated the response.

### Level of Difficulty
- **Moderate**, if you're familiar with Go. Go is a relatively simple language to learn, but if you haven't used it before, file handling and argument parsing will require some learning.
- The core task (saving output as Markdown) involves **basic Go file I/O**, which is well-documented and straightforward. The **TUI logic** might add some complexity, but the main challenge is identifying the appropriate part of the code where outputs are generated and displayed.

### Summary
The task is very feasible with a basic understanding of Go. You would need to:
- Fork the project.
- Add file-handling logic to save responses in Markdown format.
- Modify the CLI to accept a directory path for saving files.

This would involve primarily Go’s **file I/O** functionality and modifying existing CLI logic, which shouldn't be too complex.
