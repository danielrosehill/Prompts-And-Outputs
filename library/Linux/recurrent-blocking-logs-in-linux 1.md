**Summary of the prompt:** The user shared repeated SELinux log entries showing `avc: denied` messages, indicating that `rustdesk` was denied execution of `sudo` on Fedora. They asked for an explanation of these logs.

### Explanation of the Logs

These log entries indicate that **SELinux** (Security-Enhanced Linux) is denying `rustdesk` permission to execute the `sudo` command. Here's a breakdown of what's happening:

1. **SELinux Contexts:**
   - **`scontext=system_u:system_r:init_t:s0`:** This is the security context of the process trying to execute the command (`rustdesk`). It shows that `rustdesk` is running under the `init_t` domain.
   - **`tcontext=system_u:object_r:sudo_exec_t:s0`:** This is the security context of the target file (`sudo`), indicating it has the `sudo_exec_t` type.
   - **SELinux is blocking the action** because the `init_t` domain (the domain `rustdesk` is running in) is not permitted to execute `sudo`.

2. **Why Is This Happening?**
   - **SELinux Policy Enforcement:** By default, SELinux enforces strict policies that define which processes can access which files. This prevents unauthorized applications or processes from performing actions that could compromise system security.
   - **`rustdesk` Behavior:** It seems `rustdesk` is trying to run `sudo`, possibly to execute commands with elevated privileges, but SELinux policies are blocking this. This could be intentional or a misconfiguration within `rustdesk`'s operation.

### How to Resolve This

#### 1. **Check If This Behavior Is Expected:**
   - **Investigate Why `rustdesk` Is Using `sudo`:** Determine if `rustdesk` genuinely needs to execute `sudo`. If it’s unexpected, it could indicate a configuration issue or unintended behavior.
   - **Ensure Security:** Be cautious before allowing `rustdesk` to use `sudo`, especially if you didn't expect it to.

#### 2. **Temporarily Switch to Permissive Mode (for Testing Only):**
   - To confirm if SELinux is causing the issue, you can temporarily set SELinux to permissive mode:
     ```bash
     sudo setenforce 0
     ```
   - In permissive mode, SELinux will log policy violations but won’t enforce them. If `rustdesk` works without issues, you can be sure SELinux policies are the cause.
   - **Note:** Return to enforcing mode afterward:
     ```bash
     sudo setenforce 1
     ```

#### 3. **Add SELinux Policy Exception:**
   - If you are sure `rustdesk` should be allowed to run `sudo`, you can modify the SELinux policy:
     1. Create a custom module to allow the action:
        ```bash
        sudo ausearch -c "rustdesk" --raw | audit2allow -M rustdesk-sudo
        ```
     2. Load the new policy module:
        ```bash
        sudo semodule -i rustdesk-sudo.pp
        ```
   - This will create a local exception to allow `rustdesk` to run `sudo` without SELinux blocking it. 

#### 4. **Consider Disabling SELinux (Not Recommended for Security Reasons):**
   - If you find SELinux too restrictive and are confident in your system’s security otherwise, you could disable it, though this isn’t recommended:
     - Modify `/etc/selinux/config`:
       ```bash
       SELINUX=disabled
       ```
     - Reboot the system.

**Important:** Be careful when modifying security settings. Only grant `rustdesk` access if you are certain it needs it, and be cautious about disabling or weakening SELinux, as it plays a crucial role in protecting your system.
