# Prompt

Why does Wayland seem to have so many more "issues" compared to X11? If it's so buggy, why has Fedora standardised on it?

# Output

Wayland indeed appears to have more "issues" compared to X11 for some users, particularly those with complex setups (multiple displays, external monitors, specific hardware compatibility, etc.). However, the transition to Wayland is motivated by several fundamental reasons related to modernizing the Linux display stack. Let's explore both why Wayland has more issues *now* and why Fedora (and other distributions) have standardized on it.

### Why Does Wayland Have More "Issues"?

1. **Maturity and Compatibility**:
   - **X11 (X.Org)** has been around for decades (since the 1980s), which means it has had years of patches and tweaks to handle a wide variety of use cases. This level of maturity means that even corner-case hardware and software combinations work well with X11.
   - **Wayland** is relatively new (introduced in 2008 but only more recently adopted in mainstream distros). It’s still evolving, and many legacy applications or drivers are not yet fully compatible or optimized for it, causing bugs or feature gaps.

2. **Driver and Hardware Support**:
   - **DDC/CI and Multi-Monitor Support**: Tools like `ddcutil`, which rely on hardware communication, often work better with X11 because Wayland's security model restricts direct hardware access for better security and isolation. As a result, some hardware features (like adjusting monitor brightness or using certain input devices) are harder to implement.
   - **NVIDIA Compatibility**: Historically, Wayland had poor support for proprietary NVIDIA drivers, which led to issues with high-performance GPUs, though recent updates have improved this.

3. **Security Model Differences**:
   - Wayland adopts a much stricter security model compared to X11, where apps have direct access to input and display devices. This can limit functionalities like global keyboard shortcuts, screen recording, or remote desktop apps, which are easier to implement in X11 but require specific APIs in Wayland (that are still being developed).

4. **Incomplete Feature Parity**:
   - Wayland doesn't yet offer full parity with all features X11 users expect. For instance:
     - **Window management**: Some window manager features that are easy in X11 (like certain advanced window decorations or clipboard managers) don’t work the same way in Wayland.
     - **Gaming and Graphics Performance**: Some games and applications using older graphics APIs or extensions (like XInput or XRandR) have compatibility issues.
   - There are ongoing efforts to patch these gaps (through projects like **XWayland**), but this can lead to frustrations for those needing a specific feature.

### Why Has Fedora Standardized on Wayland?

Despite these issues, Fedora (and others) are pushing Wayland as the default for several reasons:

1. **Security**:
   - **Wayland** improves security by design. X11, due to its age, allows applications to snoop on each other's input/output easily, which is a significant security vulnerability (e.g., keylogging, snooping on windows, etc.).
   - Wayland isolates each application better, which makes the desktop environment more secure overall. For example, only specific permissions allow apps to access input devices or other windows in Wayland, while X11 provides more open access.

2. **Simplicity and Modern Architecture**:
   - Wayland is simpler and more modern in its design, shedding the decades of complexity and legacy baggage that X11 carries. X11's codebase is old and difficult to maintain, while Wayland is built with modern graphics (such as GPUs, compositors) in mind.
   - This makes **Wayland** potentially lighter and more efficient, especially in the long run as developers write applications directly for it.

3. **Compositing and Better Support for New Technologies**:
   - **Wayland** is designed with compositors in mind (like **Mutter** for GNOME or **KWin** for KDE). Compositors are responsible for rendering the display, and Wayland integrates this deeply. This makes it easier to support things like smooth window animations, better multi-monitor support, and high-DPI displays, which are becoming more common.
   - **X11** relies on external compositors, which means there can be lag or visual artifacts between the compositor and X11 display server.

4. **Future-Proofing**:
   - While X11 works well today, its architecture makes it difficult to support new technologies like **VR**, **touchscreens**, **gesture inputs**, and **fractional scaling** on modern displays. Wayland, by contrast, is being developed with these future technologies in mind, making it a better long-term choice.

5. **Reducing Maintenance Overhead**:
   - Maintaining both X11 and Wayland adds a burden to developers. As more distros (like Fedora) make Wayland the default, the community will shift resources to it, leading to faster improvements and better support. Fedora has long been a **"bleeding edge"** distribution, so it pushes newer technologies like Wayland to help drive adoption and development.

### Conclusion

While Wayland has more "issues" now, its long-term potential is seen as a better, more secure, and modern solution compared to X11. Fedora, being on the cutting edge, adopts Wayland to help accelerate its maturity and improve the Linux desktop experience. However, if you encounter too many issues, switching back to X11 for the time being is a reasonable compromise, especially for setups with multiple monitors or legacy hardware.
