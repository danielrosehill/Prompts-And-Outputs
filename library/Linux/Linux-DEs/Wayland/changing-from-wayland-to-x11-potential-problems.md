# Prompt

If I switch to using X11 rather than Wayland will some programs stop working and if so which ones?

# Output

Switching from **Wayland** to **X11** is generally safe, as **X11** has been the default Linux display server for decades and is supported by almost all Linux applications. However, there are a few things to keep in mind:

### Programs or Features That Might Be Affected When Switching to X11
1. **Wayland-Specific Features**:
   - **Native Wayland Applications**: Some modern applications are optimized for **Wayland** or may have extra features when running under it. For example, certain GNOME and KDE apps have been specifically tuned for better performance or security under Wayland.
   - **Gesture Support**: If you rely heavily on **multi-touch gestures** for trackpads (e.g., three-finger swipe to switch workspaces), these are often better integrated and smoother in **Wayland** compared to X11.

2. **Screen Recording and Screenshot Tools**:
   - **Wayland Security Limitations**: Wayland has strict rules about screen capturing for security reasons, meaning that most screen recording and screenshot tools need special permissions or adjustments to work. Under X11, **OBS**, **Flameshot**, and other similar tools work without additional configuration, but under Wayland, they sometimes need specific **portals** or plugins.
   - If you have customized a screen capture tool specifically for Wayland, you might lose those particular optimizations when switching to **X11**. However, the reverse is often true as well: many screen recording tools are more straightforward on **X11**.

3. **Security Features**:
   - **Application Isolation**: **Wayland** restricts the ability of applications to interact with or even see each other's windows. This isolation enhances security by preventing keyloggers or malicious apps from easily grabbing input or taking screenshots. On **X11**, this isolation doesn’t exist, which might make certain security tools (like sandboxed browser setups) less effective.

4. **KDE-Specific Features**:
   - **Wayland-Specific Rendering Improvements**: KDE Plasma has introduced several performance improvements when running on Wayland, especially in terms of **smooth rendering** and **fractional scaling**. If you switch back to X11, you may lose out on these particular performance boosts, especially on **high-DPI** displays.
   - **Touch Input**: On Wayland, touch gestures and screen touch input (like on touchscreens or tablets) have more refined support compared to X11. Depending on your use of a touchscreen, you may find **gestures** or **touch behavior** slightly less refined on X11.

5. **Gaming**:
   - **Variable Refresh Rate (VRR)**: Wayland supports features like **Variable Refresh Rate** or **Adaptive Sync** on newer hardware, which improves smoothness for gaming. On X11, support may be less consistent depending on the GPU and driver in use.
   - **NVIDIA GPU Drivers**: Historically, **NVIDIA's proprietary drivers** have had mixed compatibility with Wayland, though this is improving. On X11, NVIDIA is often better supported, and switching from Wayland may make gaming smoother if you’re experiencing issues with NVIDIA hardware under Wayland.

6. **Multi-GPU Systems**:
   - If you use a **multi-GPU setup**, such as a dedicated GPU along with integrated graphics, **Wayland** generally has better support for configuring output across multiple GPUs. On **X11**, the configuration of multi-GPU systems can require more manual setup and may be less dynamic.

7. **Graphical Tablet Support**:
   - **Wayland** has introduced more robust support for **graphical tablets**, like those from Wacom, allowing finer control of pen pressure and multi-monitor settings for tablet areas. On X11, configuring these devices often involves using command-line tools (like `xsetwacom`), which can be less convenient.

8. **Remote Access and RDP Tools**:
   - If you use **remote desktop software** like **xrdp**, **TeamViewer**, or **AnyDesk**, you'll likely find X11 to be better supported. Most remote desktop protocols and tools still rely on X11 mechanisms, as Wayland's security model often blocks direct screen capture by remote access tools. If you’ve been using a Wayland-specific remote tool, switching to X11 may require reconfiguring or changing tools.

### Programs That Typically Have No Issues
- **Web Browsers**: **Firefox**, **Chrome**, **Chromium**, and others work well on both X11 and Wayland. However, on Wayland, you may notice smoother scrolling and reduced tearing in some cases.
- **Media Players**: Tools like **VLC**, **MPV**, and others generally run well on both X11 and Wayland.
- **Office Suites**: Programs such as **LibreOffice**, **OnlyOffice**, and **WPS Office** work without issue under both display servers.
- **Code Editors**: Popular code editors like **VS Code**, **Sublime Text**, **Atom**, etc., work equally well on both Wayland and X11.
  
### Summary
- Most mainstream applications are fully compatible with both **X11** and **Wayland**, so you shouldn't see many programs stop working when you switch to X11.
- You may lose some **security features**, **gesture functionality**, and **performance optimizations** provided by Wayland, particularly in newer KDE Plasma versions.
- **Screen recording**, **remote access**, and some multi-touch or multi-GPU features may be easier to manage on **X11**, making it still a popular choice for many users, despite its downsides.

Switching to **X11** should be quite smooth, especially for those seeking compatibility with older or specialized software. It’s usually just specific Wayland-optimized features and enhanced security that you may miss.
