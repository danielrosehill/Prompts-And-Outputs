For before calls etc
Yes, KDE Plasma offers several ways to quickly and easily toggle between themes. Here are a few methods:

### 1. **Global Theme Shortcut in System Settings**
   - **System Settings > Appearance > Global Theme**: Here, you can preview and switch between themes. Plasma themes can include dark and light modes, so if you have one of each, you can switch here.
   - **Quick Access**: To make switching faster, consider adding System Settings to your favorites or creating a desktop shortcut to open directly to the Global Theme page.

### 2. **Custom Shortcut with `lookandfeeltool`**
   - KDE provides the `lookandfeeltool` command-line tool to apply themes, making it easy to create shortcuts to toggle between two or more themes:
   - **Command**: Open a terminal and try:
     ```bash
     lookandfeeltool -a <theme-name>
     ```
   - **Example**: If you have Breeze Dark and Breeze Light installed, you can toggle between them by setting shortcuts for:
     ```bash
     lookandfeeltool -a org.kde.breezedark.desktop
     lookandfeeltool -a org.kde.breeze.desktop
     ```
   - **Create Keyboard Shortcuts**: Go to **System Settings > Shortcuts > Custom Shortcuts**, create a new custom shortcut for each command, and assign a keyboard shortcut to each theme toggle.

### 3. **KDE Store Widgets for Quick Access**
   - KDE's widget library (from the KDE Store) includes theme switchers and night/light mode toggle widgets. Some popular options include:
     - **Plasma Light/Dark Switch**: A widget that allows quick switching between light and dark themes.
     - **Night Color Control**: If youâ€™re switching themes to manage screen brightness, Night Color (night mode) can also help by adjusting screen warmth.

### 4. **Scripts with Global Theme Switchers**
   - For a more custom approach, you could create a bash script to cycle between themes and assign a shortcut to run the script:
     ```bash
     #!/bin/bash
     current_theme=$(lookandfeeltool --list | grep -o "org.kde.breezedark\|org.kde.breeze")

     if [ "$current_theme" = "org.kde.breezedark" ]; then
       lookandfeeltool -a org.kde.breeze.desktop
     else
       lookandfeeltool -a org.kde.breezedark.desktop
     fi
     ```

This should provide you with a seamless, quick way to toggle themes on KDE Plasma without navigating through settings each time.
