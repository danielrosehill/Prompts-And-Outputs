**Prompt Summary:** You are asking whether it is possible to create a fully programmable keyboard for a Fedora computer, which keyboards would work for this purpose, and what the benefits would be.

---

Yes, it is absolutely possible to use a fully programmable keyboard with a Fedora computer, and there are several options available. Hereâ€™s an overview of how this works, which keyboards to consider, and the benefits of using a programmable keyboard.

### **1. What is a Fully Programmable Keyboard?**
   - **Definition:** A fully programmable keyboard allows you to customize the function of each key, create complex macros, and adjust layouts to suit your preferences. Unlike standard keyboards, where key functions are fixed, programmable keyboards can be configured via firmware or software, offering extensive customization.
   - **Customization Options:**
     - **Key Remapping:** Change the function of individual keys (e.g., make `Caps Lock` a `Ctrl` key).
     - **Macros:** Program complex sequences of keystrokes, commands, or shortcuts to a single key.
     - **Custom Layouts:** Create alternative layouts (like Dvorak or Colemak) or specialized layouts for coding, gaming, or other tasks.

### **2. Benefits of Using a Programmable Keyboard on Fedora**
   - **Increased Productivity:**
     - **Macros and Shortcuts:** Set up macros to automate repetitive tasks, saving time. For example, you could configure a key to run a shell script, open a specific application, or perform a series of commands in your terminal.
     - **Efficient Workflow:** Customize keys for your preferred development environment, video editing software, or design tools to streamline your workflow.
   - **Ergonomics and Comfort:**
     - **Custom Layouts:** Configure the keyboard to reduce hand strain by creating more efficient layouts, especially for specialized tasks like coding or gaming.
     - **Split and Ergonomic Designs:** Many programmable keyboards come in ergonomic forms that allow for better posture and reduced hand fatigue.
   - **Versatility:**
     - **Cross-Platform Support:** Most programmable keyboards work across multiple operating systems, including Linux, macOS, and Windows. Once configured, they retain their settings, making it easy to switch between devices.
     - **Portability:** Some keyboards save profiles directly in firmware, so your customizations carry over even if you plug the keyboard into a different computer.

### **3. Compatible Programmable Keyboards for Fedora**
Here are some popular options that would work well on Fedora:

#### **a. System76 Launch Keyboard**
   - **Description:** A mechanical keyboard designed specifically with Linux users in mind, including deep customization options and open-source firmware.
   - **Features:**
     - **Open-Source Firmware:** Fully programmable with QMK (Quantum Mechanical Keyboard) firmware, which allows for complex customization.
     - **Built for Linux:** Seamless integration with Linux systems, including Fedora.
     - **Hot-Swappable Switches:** Change switches without soldering, allowing for further customization.
   - **Software:** System76 provides a GUI tool for easier programming, but you can also directly configure it via QMK.

#### **b. Ultimate Hacking Keyboard (UHK)**
   - **Description:** A modular, split mechanical keyboard with extensive programmability, aimed at advanced users who need a highly customizable setup.
   - **Features:**
     - **Modular Design:** Add-on modules (like trackpads, trackpoints, or extra keys) to extend functionality.
     - **Highly Customizable:** Supports complex key mapping and macros through open-source software.
     - **Portable Profiles:** Save profiles directly on the keyboard for portability across devices.
   - **Software:** UHK Agent is available for Linux, allowing easy configuration of layouts and macros.

#### **c. ErgoDox EZ**
   - **Description:** A popular split, ergonomic keyboard that is fully programmable and customizable. Works well for users looking to create a setup that reduces strain.
   - **Features:**
     - **QMK-Compatible:** Program via QMK firmware for full control over key functions and layouts.
     - **Adjustable Layout:** Ergonomic design with split halves that can be positioned freely.
     - **Easy Setup for Linux:** Official support and community guides for configuring on Linux systems.
   - **Software:** You can use the **QMK Configurator** online to set up your custom key mappings and then flash them onto the keyboard.

#### **d. Drop (formerly Massdrop) Keyboards - e.g., Drop CTRL / ALT**
   - **Description:** High-quality mechanical keyboards with customizable layouts and support for QMK firmware.
   - **Features:**
     - **QMK-Compatible:** Fully programmable via open-source firmware, allowing detailed key remapping and macro creation.
     - **Custom RGB:** Configure RGB lighting patterns along with key functions.
     - **Portable Settings:** Flash your custom firmware to carry your settings anywhere.
   - **Software:** Use the **QMK Configurator** or build firmware from scratch for deep customization.

#### **e. Varmilo VA87M (with Varmilo Configurator)**
   - **Description:** A more traditional mechanical keyboard that offers basic programmability. Not as feature-rich as QMK keyboards but still allows customization.
   - **Features:**
     - **Custom Key Mapping:** Adjust key positions and functions via the Varmilo Configurator.
     - **Reliable and Solid Build Quality:** High-quality build that feels great for typing.
   - **Software:** Varmilo offers a configuration tool, but it may not have all the advanced features of QMK-based keyboards.

### **4. How to Set Up a Programmable Keyboard on Fedora**
1. **Install QMK Firmware (If Using a QMK-Compatible Keyboard):**
   - **QMK Installation:**
     ```bash
     sudo dnf install qmk
     qmk setup
     ```
   - **Configure Layouts:**
     - Use the **QMK Configurator** online to design your custom layout, download the firmware, and then flash it onto your keyboard.
2. **Using GUI Tools (For Easier Customization):**
   - Many keyboards, like the **UHK** and **System76 Launch**, come with dedicated configuration tools that you can install on Fedora.
   - Example: **UHK Agent Installation:**
     ```bash
     sudo dnf install uhk-agent
     ```
3. **Flashing Firmware:**
   - Connect your keyboard, open the configuration tool or QMK, and flash your custom firmware onto the keyboard to activate your settings.

### **Conclusion**
Using a fully programmable keyboard on Fedora is not only possible but offers a range of benefits, including increased productivity, ergonomics, and flexibility. With options like **System76 Launch**, **UHK**, **ErgoDox EZ**, and **Drop keyboards**, you can find a model that matches your preferences and needs. Using QMK or other configuration tools, you can easily set up your custom layouts, remap keys, and automate tasks, making your Linux workflow smoother and more efficient.
