**Prompt Summary:** You are asking if KDE is a major Linux desktop environment with a large following and developer community. You want to ensure that it's a stable and ongoing project, especially after your experience with LXDE being deprecated.

---

Yes, **KDE Plasma** is one of the major Linux desktop environments and has a **large, active community** of developers and users. It’s very stable and shows no signs of slowing down. Here are a few reasons why you can be confident in KDE's long-term viability:

### **1. Long History and Strong Development**
   - **Founded in 1996:** KDE has been around for nearly three decades, making it one of the oldest desktop environments in the Linux world. Its long history shows that it has the resilience and support to keep evolving.
   - **Active Development:** KDE has a dedicated team of core developers, as well as contributions from a large community. New features, bug fixes, and performance improvements are released regularly. KDE Plasma 5, in particular, has received frequent updates, and KDE Plasma 6 is currently in development.

### **2. Large and Active Community**
   - **Global Contributor Base:** The KDE community includes developers, designers, translators, and users from around the world. This widespread participation ensures that KDE remains vibrant and well-supported.
   - **KDE Community Events:** Events like **Akademy** (KDE’s annual conference) and **Sprints** keep the community engaged and actively working on new projects and improvements. This strong network helps sustain development and innovation.
   - **Plasma Mobile:** The KDE project isn’t limited to desktops; they’re also developing **Plasma Mobile**, a version of KDE Plasma for mobile devices. This shows their commitment to expanding and maintaining their ecosystem.

### **3. Support from Major Linux Distributions**
   - **Fedora KDE Spin, Kubuntu, openSUSE, Manjaro KDE, Arch:** Many major Linux distributions offer KDE Plasma as a core desktop environment. The continued support from these distributions is a strong indicator of KDE’s importance and stability within the Linux ecosystem.
   - **Kubuntu:** Canonical (the company behind Ubuntu) continues to support **Kubuntu**, a flavor of Ubuntu with KDE Plasma as the default. This long-term support means KDE is very unlikely to be abandoned.

### **4. Versatile and User-Friendly**
   - **Customization and Performance:** KDE is known for its incredible customization capabilities. Over the years, KDE Plasma has also become lighter and faster, making it suitable for both new and experienced users. This adaptability helps maintain its popularity across a wide user base.
   - **Broad Use Cases:** KDE is flexible enough to be used on desktops, laptops, low-powered devices, and even in educational environments through projects like **KDE Edu**.

### **5. Strong Infrastructure and Organization**
   - **KDE e.V.:** The KDE project is managed by a non-profit organization called **KDE e.V.**, which handles funding, legal matters, and organizational issues. This formal structure helps ensure long-term sustainability and provides a stable foundation for the project.
   - **Partnerships and Funding:** KDE receives support and funding from companies and organizations that believe in open-source software, further contributing to its longevity.

### **Comparison with LXDE**
   - **LXDE’s Transition to LXQt:** LXDE was lightweight and popular but struggled with maintaining development momentum, which eventually led to its transition to **LXQt** (a similar project based on Qt instead of GTK). In contrast, KDE’s ongoing development and strong community ensure it won’t face a similar fate.

### **Conclusion**
KDE is one of the **most established** and **actively developed** desktop environments in the Linux world, with a strong community, frequent updates, and support from many major distributions. You can confidently choose KDE Plasma, knowing that it has the infrastructure, community, and development to keep it going strong for the foreseeable future.
