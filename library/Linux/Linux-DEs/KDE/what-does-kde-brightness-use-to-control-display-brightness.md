You asked what KDE Plasma uses to control display brightness. KDE Plasma uses a combination of software tools to manage display brightness, depending on the hardware and drivers in use. The brightness control typically interacts with:

1. **`xrandr`** or **`Wayland`**: 
   - If you're using X11, Plasma adjusts brightness using the `xrandr` tool, which interacts with your display settings. 
   - For Wayland, brightness adjustments are handled directly by the compositor, in this case, KWin for KDE.

2. **`DDC/CI` (Display Data Channel Command Interface)**: 
   - On some hardware, especially external monitors, KDE might use the DDC/CI protocol to directly control brightness through the monitor's settings.

3. **`sysfs` interface**:
   - On many laptops, the system uses the `/sys/class/backlight/` interface in Linux. KDE adjusts the values of brightness files in this directory to control the backlight intensity.

4. **Graphics Drivers**:
   - Plasma's brightness control is also dependent on the graphics driver being used (e.g., Intel, AMD, or NVIDIA). These drivers expose brightness controls through various interfaces like `acpi_video`, `intel_backlight`, or proprietary NVIDIA settings.

In summary, Plasma interacts with the underlying system (via `sysfs`, `xrandr`, or Wayland) to adjust brightness, relying on your hardware and drivers for actual control.
