**Summary:** You are asking for theme suggestions that provide a balance between light and dark themes, offering a more neutral or "intermediate" appearance in KDE.

### Themes That Offer a Balance Between Light and Dark

1. **Breeze Twilight (Default KDE)**
   - **Description**: A hybrid theme that combines a dark taskbar and application window frames with lighter application content. It's a great option if you want the benefits of a dark theme without the full dark experience.
   - **Availability**: Pre-installed on KDE systems.

2. **Nordic**
   - **Description**: A theme based on the popular **Nord color palette**, which features cool, muted blues and grays. It’s easier on the eyes than bright light themes but doesn’t have the full contrast of a dark theme.
   - **Availability**: Can be installed via KDE Store or GitHub.

3. **Adapta Nokto-Eta**
   - **Description**: A soft dark theme with subtle, light accents. It’s a dark theme but not as deep or harsh as pure black themes, offering a comfortable mix of contrast and readability.
   - **Availability**: Available on KDE Store.

4. **Arc**
   - **Description**: A popular theme that blends both light and dark elements. It has a light gray background with darker accents, providing a neutral look that doesn’t strain the eyes.
   - **Variants**: Arc (light), Arc-Dark, and Arc-Darker (in-between).
   - **Availability**: Installable from the KDE Store or package managers.

5. **Materia Manjaro**
   - **Description**: A variant of the Material theme with a balanced gray tone that falls between light and dark. It’s soft and muted, with slight transparency, giving it a modern feel.
   - **Variants**: Includes **Materia Dark**, **Materia Light**, and **Materia Manjaro**, with the last offering a middle-ground.
   - **Availability**: Available on KDE Store and through GitHub.

6. **Layan**
   - **Description**: A modern, flat theme with a soft dark interface and contrasting elements that aren't too stark. It provides a comfortable viewing experience without fully committing to dark or light.
   - **Variants**: Includes light and dark options, but the default is an intermediate tone.
   - **Availability**: Can be found on KDE Store.

7. **Dracula**
   - **Description**: Based on the popular Dracula theme, it offers a darker interface but with muted, pastel highlights and backgrounds that soften the experience. Great for a night-friendly mode without pure black backgrounds.
   - **Availability**: Available from the KDE Store or through GitHub.

8. **Numix Frost**
   - **Description**: A cool, soft theme with a balanced color scheme that isn’t too light or too dark. It uses gentle contrasts, making it a good choice for a middle-ground visual experience.
   - **Availability**: Can be installed via KDE Store or package repositories.

### How to Install Themes
- **KDE Store**: You can install themes directly from the **System Settings > Appearance > Global Theme** by clicking on the **Get New Global Themes** button and searching for the suggested themes.
- **Manual Installation**: Download from the KDE Store or GitHub, then extract and copy the theme files to `~/.local/share/plasma/look-and-feel/` (for local use) or `/usr/share/plasma/look-and-feel/` (system-wide).

These themes should help you find a visual style that provides a softer, less extreme user experience between the typical light and dark themes.
