To summarize: you're asking if adding an **`fstab`** entry for the NAS is risky and whether it could prevent the system from booting if the NAS's IP changes or becomes unavailable.

Yes, you're right. If the **NAS** is unavailable or its **IP address** changes, it could potentially cause delays or even issues during boot. However, there are **safe configurations** you can use in `/etc/fstab` to prevent this from blocking the system boot.

### Solutions to Safely Handle NAS Mounting in `/etc/fstab`:

#### 1. **Using the `nofail` Option**:
   The `nofail` option ensures that even if the NAS is unavailable at boot, the system will **not hang** or fail to boot. The system will skip the mount if it fails to find the NAS but continue booting normally.

   **`nofail` option example**:
   ```bash
   192.168.1.50:/volume1/desktop_overflow /mnt/desktop_overflow nfs defaults,nofail 0 0
   ```

   With the `nofail` option, your system will still boot successfully, even if the NAS cannot be reached (e.g., due to a changed IP address or downtime).

#### 2. **Using the `x-systemd.automount` Option**:
   Another option is to use **systemdâ€™s automount feature** to delay mounting until the first time the NAS is accessed. This way, the NAS will only be mounted when needed, not during the boot process, which eliminates any boot delays if the NAS is unavailable.

   **`x-systemd.automount` option example**:
   ```bash
   192.168.1.50:/volume1/desktop_overflow /mnt/desktop_overflow nfs defaults,x-systemd.automount 0 0
   ```

   With this configuration, the NAS will mount the first time you access `/mnt/desktop_overflow`, and the system will not try to mount it during boot.

#### 3. **Using NetworkManager with Autofs**:
   You can use **`autofs`** to dynamically mount the NAS when it is accessed, rather than mounting it at boot. This avoids the need for a permanent mount in `/etc/fstab` and can handle NAS availability dynamically.

   **Install autofs**:
   ```bash
   sudo dnf install autofs
   ```

   Then configure autofs to automatically mount the NAS when accessed. This method is very flexible and allows the NAS to mount and unmount as needed.

### Preventing Boot Issues:
To prevent any system boot issues, the **`nofail`** and **`x-systemd.automount`** options are the most straightforward and effective ways to make sure your system can still boot normally if the NAS is unavailable.

### Summary:
- **Risk of mounting NAS in `/etc/fstab`**: Without safe options, it could delay or block the boot process if the NAS is unavailable.
- **`nofail`** option: Ensures the system boots even if the NAS cannot be reached.
- **`x-systemd.automount`** option: Delays mounting the NAS until it is accessed, preventing boot issues.
- **`autofs`**: Provides dynamic mounting when needed.

Using one of these options will help you mount the NAS safely without affecting the boot process. Let me know if you'd like more details on any of these methods!
