Based on the information provided in the search results, PyInstaller creates a standalone executable application. Specifically:

1. PyInstaller bundles a Python application and all its dependencies into a single package[2][3].

2. The output is an executable file or folder that can run on computers without Python installed[2][3].

3. For Windows, it creates an .exe file[3][4].

4. The output is placed in a "dist" folder by default[3][4].

5. This bundled executable contains the Python interpreter and all necessary dependencies[2][3].

So in summary, PyInstaller creates a standalone executable distribution format. This is not a specific named format like RPM or DEB, but rather a self-contained executable package that includes everything needed to run the Python application on the target system without requiring Python to be installed separately.

# It has no file extension
You're correct, and that's an important observation. The file you've shared doesn't have a file extension. This is actually quite common in Linux and Unix-like systems, where file extensions are often optional for executable files.

In the context of Python and the PyInstaller tool we discussed earlier, this is perfectly normal. When PyInstaller creates a standalone executable from a Python script, the resulting file typically doesn't have an extension on Linux systems. This is different from Windows, where executables usually have a .exe extension.

Here's what you need to know about this:

1. On Linux, file extensions are not necessary for executables. The system determines if a file is executable based on its permissions, not its name or extension.

2. When you use PyInstaller to create a standalone executable on Linux, it will by default create a file without an extension. This file will be placed in a "dist" directory.

3. To run this file, you would typically make it executable first using the chmod command:

   ```
   chmod +x ./dist/program
   ```

   Then you can run it directly:

   ```
   ./dist/program
   ```

4. The lack of file extension doesn't affect the functionality of the program. It's still a fully functional executable that contains your Python script and all its dependencies.

5. If you prefer, you can rename the file and add an extension (like .run or .bin) for clarity, but this is not required for the program to function.

This approach aligns with Linux conventions and keeps the distribution simple and straightforward. Users on Linux systems will be familiar with executables without extensions, so this format should not pose any usability issues.
