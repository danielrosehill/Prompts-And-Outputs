# Prompt

This prompt is intended to create a GUI for running prompts through the OpenAI API and automatically saving the outputs and prompts into specific folders within an Obsidian vault. The prompt may be unclear. It also does not emphasise that the GUI should look attractive! Please improve it so that it is more clear and provides sufficient instructions to create a more impressive GUI.

# Output

Here's an improved version of the prompt to create a more impressive and clear GUI for running prompts through the OpenAI API:

## Create an Elegant GUI for OpenAI Prompt Runner

Design and implement a sleek, modern Python GUI application that allows users to interact with the OpenAI API and manage prompts and outputs within an Obsidian vault. The application should have the following features and design elements:

### User Interface Components

1. **Prompt Input Area**: 
   - A large, multi-line text field for entering prompts
   - Syntax highlighting for better readability
   - Line numbers for easy reference

2. **Prompt Title Field**:
   - A single-line input field for entering the prompt title
   - Auto-suggestion feature based on existing prompt titles

3. **Folder Configuration**:
   - Two folder selection buttons with path display:
     a. Prompts folder (for storing prompt files)
     b. Outputs folder (for storing API responses)
   - Option to set default locations within the Obsidian vault

4. **API Key Management**:
   - A secure input field for the OpenAI API key
   - Option to save the API key securely between sessions

5. **Execution Controls**:
   - A prominently placed "Run Prompt" button with a modern, flat design
   - Progress indicator for API requests

6. **Output Display**:
   - A resizable terminal-like output pane for displaying job progress and results
   - Syntax highlighting for JSON or markdown responses

7. **Status Bar**:
   - Display current status, last run time, and other relevant information

### Functionality

1. **Prompt Execution**:
   - Send the entered prompt to the OpenAI API when "Run Prompt" is clicked
   - Display a loading animation during API communication

2. **File Management**:
   - Save the prompt to the prompts folder with the specified title (replace spaces with hyphens)
   - Save the API output to the outputs folder with the same filename as the prompt

3. **Session Persistence**:
   - Store user settings (folders, API key) securely between sessions

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Display user-friendly error messages for API issues or file operations

5. **Keyboard Shortcuts**:
   - Implement common shortcuts for improved usability (e.g., Ctrl+Enter to run prompt)

### Design and Aesthetics

1. **Color Scheme**:
   - Use a modern, customizable color palette (light and dark modes)
   - Ensure high contrast for readability

2. **Layout**:
   - Implement a responsive design that adjusts to window resizing
   - Use a grid system for organized placement of UI elements

3. **Animations**:
   - Add subtle animations for button clicks, transitions, and loading states

4. **Typography**:
   - Use a clean, readable font for all text elements
   - Implement proper text scaling for different screen sizes

5. **Icons**:
   - Incorporate vector icons for buttons and status indicators

### Additional Features

1. **Prompt Library**:
   - Add a searchable list of saved prompts for quick access

2. **Output Formatting**:
   - Provide options to format API outputs (e.g., JSON prettify, markdown rendering)

3. **API Model Selection**:
   - Allow users to choose different OpenAI models for their requests

4. **Prompt Templates**:
   - Implement a system for creating and using prompt templates

Ensure the GUI is intuitive, visually appealing, and provides a smooth user experience. Use modern Python GUI frameworks like PyQt6 or Tkinter with custom styling to achieve a professional look. Prioritize performance and responsiveness in the application design.
