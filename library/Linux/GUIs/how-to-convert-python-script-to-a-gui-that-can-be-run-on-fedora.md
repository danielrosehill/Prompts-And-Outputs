Great. But the program is still just a python file. how do i convert it to an app that I can actually run from an application menu on my computer

To convert your Python script into an application that you can run from the application menu on your computer, you'll need to package it into an executable. This process depends on your operating system, but here are the general steps for creating a standalone application:

### **1. **Convert Python Script to Executable

#### **Using PyInstaller**
PyInstaller is a popular tool for converting Python scripts into standalone executables. Here’s how to do it:

1. **Install PyInstaller**:
   - Run the following command in your terminal to install PyInstaller:
     ```bash
     pip install pyinstaller
     ```

2. **Create the Executable**:
   - Navigate to the directory where your `script_runner.py` is located.
   - Run PyInstaller with the following command:
     ```bash
     pyinstaller --onefile --windowed script_runner.py
     ```
   - **Options**:
     - `--onefile`: Packages everything into a single executable.
     - `--windowed`: Prevents the terminal window from appearing (important for GUI apps).
   - This will create a `dist/` directory containing your standalone executable file.

3. **Test the Executable**:
   - Navigate to the `dist/` directory and run your new executable to make sure it works as expected.

### **2. **Create a Desktop Entry (Linux)
For Linux users, creating a desktop entry allows your application to appear in the application menu.

1. **Create a `.desktop` File**:
   - Create a new file in `~/.local/share/applications/` called `ObsidianScriptRunner.desktop`.
   - Here’s an example content for the file:
     ```ini
     [Desktop Entry]
     Name=Obsidian Script Runner
     Comment=Run various scripts for Obsidian Vault management
     Exec=/path/to/your/executable/script_runner
     Icon=/path/to/your/icon/icon.png
     Terminal=false
     Type=Application
     Categories=Utility;
     ```

2. **Update the Desktop Database**:
   - Run the following command to update the desktop database and make your new application available:
     ```bash
     update-desktop-database ~/.local/share/applications/
     ```

3. **Launch from Menu**:
   - You should now see "Obsidian Script Runner" in your application menu.

### **3. **Creating an App on Windows**

1. **Create a Shortcut**:
   - Right-click on the `script_runner.exe` (the executable you created with PyInstaller) and select **Create Shortcut**.

2. **Move to Start Menu**:
   - Move the shortcut to the Start Menu directory:
     ```bash
     C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs
     ```
   - You can rename the shortcut to something like "Obsidian Script Runner".

3. **Add Icon**:
   - Right-click the shortcut, select **Properties**, and under the **Shortcut** tab, click **Change Icon**. You can choose an icon file for your application.

### **4. **Creating an App on macOS**

1. **Bundle the App**:
   - On macOS, you can create a `.app` bundle. There are tools like `py2app` for converting Python scripts into macOS application bundles.
   - Install `py2app`:
     ```bash
     pip install py2app
     ```

2. **Create the `.app` Bundle**:
   - Create a setup file `setup.py` for `py2app`:
     ```python
     from setuptools import setup

     APP = ['script_runner.py']
     DATA_FILES = []
     OPTIONS = {
         'argv_emulation': True,
         'packages': [],
         'iconfile': 'icon.icns',
     }

     setup(
         app=APP,
         data_files=DATA_FILES,
         options={'py2app': OPTIONS},
         setup_requires=['py2app'],
     )
     ```
   - Run the following command to create the app:
     ```bash
     python setup.py py2app
     ```
   - The app will be created in the `dist` directory.

3. **Move to Applications**:
   - You can move the created `.app` file to your `/Applications` directory.

### **Conclusion**
After converting your Python script into an executable and creating the appropriate desktop entry (on Linux) or shortcut (on Windows/macOS), you can easily run your script from the application menu just like any other installed app. This makes it much more convenient to use and accessible, streamlining your workflow even further.## Extracted Prompts
