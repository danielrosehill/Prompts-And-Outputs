Would it be possible to release this via Streamlit?

# Output

Yes, releasing your stack evaluation tool via Streamlit is an excellent idea! Streamlit would be a great fit for this project for several reasons:

1. Easy to develop: Streamlit allows you to create interactive web applications using pure Python, which aligns well with your existing skills and the nature of your project[1].

2. Quick prototyping: You can rapidly develop and iterate on your GUI, seeing changes in real-time as you code[1].

3. Built-in widgets: Streamlit offers a variety of pre-built widgets like sliders, buttons, and input fields that you can use to create an interactive interface for users to input their project requirements[1][4].

4. Data visualization: If you want to include any charts or visualizations of the stack recommendations, Streamlit has built-in support for various plotting libraries[2].

5. Easy deployment: Streamlit offers a free hosting service (Streamlit Community Cloud) where you can easily deploy your application, making it accessible to users without them needing to install anything[6].

6. API integration: Streamlit can easily integrate with external APIs, which is perfect for your use case of calling the Anthropic API[4].

7. Popularity in data science community: Streamlit is widely used and loved in the data science community, which could help your tool gain traction[2].

To implement your stack evaluation tool using Streamlit, you could:

1. Create input fields for users to specify their project requirements.
2. Use these inputs to formulate a query for the Anthropic API.
3. Display the API response (stack recommendations) in a structured, easy-to-read format.
4. Potentially add features like saving/loading evaluations or comparing multiple stacks.

For handling API keys securely, you could:

1. Use Streamlit's secrets management for storing the Anthropic API key when deployed[5].
2. For local development, use environment variables or a config file (as discussed earlier).

Releasing via Streamlit would make your tool easily accessible to a wide range of users, regardless of their technical expertise or operating system. It's a great way to share your project with the community while providing a user-friendly interface for stack evaluation.
