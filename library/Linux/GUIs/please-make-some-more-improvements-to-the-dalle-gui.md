# Prompt


Thank you for generating this GUI for saving images created with DALLE. Please go ahead and make a few improvements. 

Here are a few requests:

Firstly, let's add a progress bar to show when the prompt is running and when it's been returned

Secondly, let's add a display pane that should show the generated image when it's received back.  This shouldn't be too big but it should allow the image to be displayed. There should be a button beneath that which says "Open In Photo Editor" and a button to show the image in its full size resolution. If the user chooses the second button, the image should appear in a modal over the main GUI

Finally let's consider that the user will want to run this repeatedly in a session. So after the first prompt is run, the input fields should clear so that the user can continue with another generation
