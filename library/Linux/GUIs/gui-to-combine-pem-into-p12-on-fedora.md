Yes, you can use **Kleopatra**, a graphical interface for managing certificates and keys, on Fedora. Kleopatra is part of the Gpg4win suite, but it also works on Linux distributions like Fedora, and it supports operations such as combining PEM files into PKCS#12 (`.p12` or `.pfx`) format.

### Steps to Install and Use Kleopatra on Fedora:

#### 1. **Install Kleopatra**:
   You can install Kleopatra through Fedora's package manager.

   Open a terminal and run:
   ```bash
   sudo dnf install kleopatra
   ```

#### 2. **Launch Kleopatra**:
   After installation, launch Kleopatra from your desktop environment by searching for "Kleopatra" in the application menu, or you can run it from the terminal:

   ```bash
   kleopatra
   ```

#### 3. **Combine PEM Files into a PKCS#12 (.p12)**:
   Once Kleopatra is open, follow these steps to combine your PEM files:

   - **Import your private key**:
     1. Go to **File > Import Certificates**.
     2. Select your private key PEM file (`privatekey.pem`) and import it.

   - **Import your certificate**:
     1. After importing the key, do the same for the certificate (`certificate.pem`), following the same steps.

   - **Export as PKCS#12**:
     1. Once both the certificate and private key are imported, go to **File > Export Certificates**.
     2. Select the private key and the corresponding certificate.
     3. Choose **Export as PKCS#12** and follow the prompts to create the `.p12` file.
     4. You will be asked to provide an export password for the `.p12` file (this password will be required when importing the `.p12` file on Android).

#### 4. **Use the Generated PKCS#12 File**:
   After exporting, you'll have a `.p12` file that you can transfer to your Android device and install.

### Alternative: **XCA (X Certificate and Key Management)**:
If you need more advanced certificate management features, **XCA** is another option with a GUI for managing certificates and keys.

#### Steps to Install and Use XCA:

1. **Install XCA**:
   ```bash
   sudo dnf install xca
   ```

2. **Launch XCA**:
   Run `xca` from the terminal or search for it in the application menu.

3. **Import and Export**:
   - Open **XCA** and create a new database or open an existing one.
   - Use the **Certificates** tab to import your PEM files (certificate and private key).
   - After importing, you can export them as a PKCS#12 file using the **Export** option in the menu.

### Conclusion:
Both **Kleopatra** and **XCA** provide a graphical interface for combining PEM files into a PKCS#12 format on Fedora. Kleopatra is more straightforward and user-friendly for basic tasks, while XCA offers more advanced features if needed.
