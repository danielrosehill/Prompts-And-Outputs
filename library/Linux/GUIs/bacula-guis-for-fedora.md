Yes, there are a couple of Bacula GUI options that work on Fedora:

### 1. **Bacula-Web**
   - **Description**: Bacula-Web is a PHP-based web interface for Bacula that allows you to monitor and manage your backups through a browser. While it doesn’t offer all configuration options, it’s useful for tracking job statuses, viewing backup logs, and managing restores.
   - **Installation**:
     1. Install the required PHP packages:
        ```bash
        sudo dnf install httpd php php-mysqlnd php-xml php-mbstring
        ```
     2. Download Bacula-Web from its [official site](https://www.bacula-web.org/) and extract it to your web server’s directory (e.g., `/var/www/html/bacula-web`).
     3. Configure `config.php` with your Bacula database details.
     4. Start and enable the Apache server:
        ```bash
        sudo systemctl start httpd
        sudo systemctl enable httpd
        ```
     5. Access Bacula-Web via `http://localhost/bacula-web` or your server's IP.

   - **Pros**: Easy to set up, web-based (accessible from any device on your network), great for monitoring and managing backup jobs.
   - **Cons**: Limited configuration capabilities—better for monitoring than setup.

### 2. **Bat (Bacula Administration Tool)**
   - **Description**: Bat is a graphical tool that offers more direct control over Bacula jobs. It has a GUI that provides better integration for scheduling, managing, and restoring backups.
   - **Installation**:
     1. Install Bat using:
        ```bash
        sudo dnf install bacula-console-qt
        ```
     2. Launch Bat by running:
        ```bash
        bat
        ```
   - **Pros**: Provides a desktop-based GUI for more detailed interaction with Bacula, including setting up jobs, restoring files, and managing configurations.
   - **Cons**: The interface can be a bit dated, and it may take some time to get used to.

### Recommendation:
For a more integrated backup experience on Fedora, **Bat** is the better choice, as it allows direct interaction with Bacula’s features through a GUI. **Bacula-Web** is helpful for monitoring but doesn’t replace the need for configuring jobs via configuration files or a tool like Bat. 

You can use **both tools** in tandem: Bat for setup and direct management, and Bacula-Web for ongoing monitoring.
