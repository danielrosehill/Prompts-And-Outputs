# Prompt

Here's my real question. As the system scales there are going to be hundreds of prompts and outputs. There already are! I think MongoDB Compass might make sense as an additional way to get the data in. But even if I were doing this, I'd need some visual way to identify a prompt from the collection to assign it as a related field. Is there any way to do that or would I have to look up the document ID and manually reference it?

# Output

Based on your question and the context of your project, I understand your concern about managing a large number of prompts and outputs in MongoDB as your system scales. You're right that manually referencing document IDs can become cumbersome as the collection grows. Here are some approaches you could consider:

1. Using MongoDB Compass:
MongoDB Compass does provide some features that can help with this process, but it's not optimized for the kind of relational linking you're looking to do. However, you can use its query features to find relevant prompts more easily.

2. Custom Admin Interface:
Given the scale you're dealing with, it might be worth considering building a custom admin interface tailored to your needs. This could be based on the LLMVaultBackupUtility you've already created (as shown in the provided code), but with added functionality for managing prompts and outputs.

3. Implementing a Search Feature:
Whether in Compass or a custom interface, implementing a search feature would make it much easier to find relevant prompts. MongoDB's text search capabilities could be useful here.

4. Using a Lookup or Autocomplete Feature:
In a custom interface, you could implement a lookup or autocomplete feature that allows you to search for prompts by title or content, and then automatically fills in the ObjectId.

5. Temporary Tagging System:
You could implement a temporary tagging system in your prompts collection. When you're ready to link an output to a prompt, you could add a unique tag to the prompt, easily find it by that tag, create the link, and then remove the tag.

6. Bulk Operations:
For initial data migration, you might consider using bulk operations where you prepare the links in a separate process (perhaps using a spreadsheet to match prompts and outputs), and then update many documents at once.

Given the scale of your project and the need for a more visual, user-friendly way to manage these relationships, I would recommend developing a custom admin interface. This interface could:

1. Display prompts and outputs in a more readable format
2. Implement search and filter functionality
3. Allow for easy linking between prompts and outputs without needing to manually copy ObjectIds
4. Provide a way to view and manage relationships between documents

You could extend your existing LLMVaultBackupUtility to include these features, or create a new web-based admin interface using a framework like React or Vue.js, which could interact with your MongoDB database through a backend API.

This approach would give you the flexibility to create exactly the workflow you need for managing your prompts and outputs, while still leveraging the power and scalability of MongoDB for data storage.
