To condense the content from the first two pages of the **Indoor Preparedness Guidelines** into a single A4 page, consider the following streamlined format:
### **Indoor Preparedness Guidelines for Rocket Alerts (Condensed)**

1. **Best Shelter Options**:
   - **Priority 1**: **Designated Protected Space (Mamad, Miklat, Mamak)**
     - Use if accessible. Familiarize yourself with local public shelters beforehand.
   - **Priority 2**: **Building Stairwell**
     - Choose stairwells **without windows/external walls**. If windows are unavoidable, stay **below the window line**. Prefer stairwells with at least **two floors above** and place chairs for elderly use.
   - **Priority 3**: **Unprotected Room**
     - Select a room with **minimal openings and exterior walls**. Avoid kitchens, bathrooms, and toilets. Stay **below the window line** if no fully enclosed room is available.

2. **General Safety**:
   - Wait **10 minutes** after the all-clear signal.
   - Keep **entrances accessible** and **doors open** for shelter seekers.

3. **More Information**: Visit [Home Front Command](http://oref.org.il/eng).

### **Change Log**
- **Version 4 (08/08/24)**: Final clarity and usability adjustments. 

This updated version ensures essential details on stairwell and room selection are included, providing concise, practical guidance.

# Suggested layout

For the **Indoor Preparedness Guidelines**, here‚Äôs a suggested layout and iconography that can make the document visually clear and easy to follow on a single A4 page:

   - Place the title at the top, centered: **"Indoor Preparedness Guidelines for Rocket Alerts"**
   - Below the title, include a brief, single-line description: *"Quick reference for choosing the best shelter during a rocket alert."*

2. **Icons and Sections**:
   - **3 Columns for Shelter Priorities**:
     - Each priority (1, 2, and 3) can have a **dedicated column**, making the information easy to scan.
     - Include a **large, clear icon** at the top of each column, with the title underneath:
       - **Priority 1**: House with a shield icon
       - **Priority 2**: Staircase icon
       - **Priority 3**: Simple room icon with an open door
   - **Bullet Points**: Use brief, bulleted instructions for each priority. Keep the text concise and space-efficient.

3. **General Safety Section**:
   - Separate this section with a horizontal line under the main content.
   - Use an **exclamation mark icon** for quick visibility.
   - Keep this section in a smaller font to avoid overcrowding.

4. **Footer Section**:
