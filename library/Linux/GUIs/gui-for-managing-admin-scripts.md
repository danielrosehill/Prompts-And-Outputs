I am using a mixture of Bash and Python scripts on my Linux Fedora computer to do things like backing up important files to remote storage locations such as B2. For a long time I've been looking for something like a GUI that would allow me to kind of manage these scripts in an inventory and run them visually (or set up cron jobs visually). Is there anything like this?

Yes, there are a few tools that can help you manage, run, and schedule your Bash and Python scripts through a graphical user interface (GUI). These tools can make it easier to handle your scripts and set up cron jobs without needing to manually edit configuration files or use the command line for everything.

     - **Task Scheduling:** You can schedule tasks (scripts) to run at specified intervals, similar to cron jobs.
     - **Script Management:** Allows you to create and manage your scripts within the GUI, and execute them manually or on a schedule.
     - **Logging and Monitoring:** Provides logging and monitoring of your script executions, making it easier to troubleshoot issues.

   - **Installation:** You can install Gnome Schedule using your package manager (`dnf install gnome-schedule`), though it might be labeled under a different name depending on your distribution.

### 4. **Stacer**
   - **Overview:** Stacer is a system optimizer and monitoring tool that includes a basic interface for managing startup applications and services, but it also has a task scheduler feature.
   - **Key Features:**
     - **Task Scheduling:** While Stacer’s task scheduler is not as advanced as some other tools, it allows you to set up and manage cron jobs visually.

     - **Scheduled Jobs:** Schedule jobs (scripts) to run at specified times, similar to cron jobs.
     - **User Management:** Manage who can run which scripts, providing a secure environment for script execution.
