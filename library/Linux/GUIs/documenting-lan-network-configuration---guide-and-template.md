**Prompt Summary:** You are asking for a guide and template to thoroughly document your LAN network configuration, set up with your ISP, to assist with provisioning it at a new location.

---

Here’s a detailed guide and template for documenting your **LAN network configuration**. Proper documentation will help ensure you can quickly and accurately replicate your setup if you move to a new location or need to reconfigure your network. This template covers key aspects, including physical setup, IP addressing, device configurations, and more.

### **Guide to Documenting Your LAN Network Configuration**
The documentation should be clear, detailed, and organized. Break it down into several key sections:

1. **Network Overview**
   - Provide a high-level description of the network setup, its purpose, and any key considerations (e.g., specific devices that require a static IP or particular VLAN configurations).

2. **Physical Network Layout**
   - Document the physical topology, including diagrams. Indicate how devices are connected (e.g., through routers, switches, access points) and where they are located.

3. **IP Addressing Scheme**
   - Record the IP address ranges, static IP assignments, and DHCP settings.
   - Include details on network segmentation (e.g., subnets, VLANs).

4. **Device Configuration**
   - List all devices (routers, switches, APs, servers, smart home hubs) with details on their configurations, IP addresses, and purpose.
   - Include specific configuration settings that might need to be replicated (e.g., DNS settings, port forwarding).

5. **WiFi Configuration**
   - Document SSID names, passwords, encryption types, and any specific settings (e.g., guest networks).

6. **Special Configurations or Rules**
   - Include any firewall rules, QoS settings, VLANs, or other custom configurations.

7. **ISP and External Connectivity Details**
   - Record details from your ISP, including static IPs, gateway settings, and DNS information.

8. **Backup and Recovery Information**
   - Include backup procedures for configurations and any recovery notes.

### **Template: LAN Network Configuration Documentation**

#### **1. Network Overview**
- **Description:** 
  - Briefly describe the purpose of the network (e.g., home network with smart devices, small office setup).
- **Key Considerations:** 
  - Note any specific requirements (e.g., low-latency for gaming, secure VLANs for IoT devices).

#### **2. Physical Network Layout**
- **Network Diagram:**
  - Attach or draw a diagram of your network topology.
    - Include key devices: **Router**, **Switches**, **Access Points**, **Servers**, **Smart Home Hubs**, etc.
- **Location Map (Optional):**
  - Document where devices are physically located (e.g., "Router in living room," "Switch in office").

#### **3. IP Addressing Scheme**
- **IP Range:** 
  - `Subnet:` `192.168.1.0/24`

- **Static IP Assignments:**
  - `Device Name` - `IP Address` - `Purpose/Notes`
    - Example: `NAS` - `192.168.1.10` - `Network storage for backup`
    - Example: `Home Server` - `192.168.1.20` - `Media streaming`
