Let's add a few structural notes. The group works in a shared Google Drive folder. So they can see each other's work later but  not in real time. 

Please generate a friendly document addressed to somebody participating in this. Provide them with instructions about the objectives and how the session will be structured.

Dear Prompting Sprint Participant,

We're excited to have you join our collaborative prompting sprint! This 45-minute session is designed to help us tackle a specific challenge using the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) and our collective brainpower. Here's what you need to know:

Objective:
Our goal is to generate innovative ideas and potential solutions for [specific problem/challenge]. We'll be using an LLM to assist us, but the real magic comes from how we combine the AI's outputs with our own expertise and creativity.

Session Structure:
We'll have four 10-minute rounds, alternating between individual prompting and group discussion. Here's how it'll work:

1. Individual Prompting (5 minutes):
   - Use the LLM to explore our challenge and generate ideas.
   - Save your outputs in a document within our shared Google Drive folder.

2. Group Discussion (5 minutes):
   - We'll come together to share insights and build on each other's ideas.
   - Take notes on the key points in your personal document.

3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 three more times, focusing on:
   - Round 2: Solution brainstorming
   - Round 3: Deep dive into chosen solutions
   - Round 4: Refinement and action planning

Important Notes:
- While we can't see each other's work in real-time, we'll be able to review everyone's contributions after the session.
- Save your work frequently in the Google Drive folder.
- Be ready to summarize your key findings during the group discussions.
- Stay open to new ideas and be ready to build on your teammates' insights!

After the Session:
Take some time to review the documents your teammates have created in the shared folder. You might find additional insights or connections that weren't apparent during our fast-paced session.

Remember, the goal is to generate a wealth of ideas that we can refine and develop further after the sprint. Let's harness the power of AI and our collective creativity to tackle this challenge!

Looking forward to our collaborative prompting sprint!

[Your Name/Organization]
