# Prompt

I'm new to learning about Python. How long do you think it would have taken ME to be able to put something like this together?

# Output

As a beginner learning Python, creating an application like the Obsidian Vault Prompt Runner would likely take you several months to a year of dedicated study and practice. Here's why:

1. **Python Fundamentals**: You'd need to master basic Python concepts like variables, data types, control structures, functions, and object-oriented programming. This alone could take 2-3 months of consistent study[1].

2. **GUI Programming**: The application uses PyQt6, a complex GUI framework. Learning to create graphical interfaces, handle events, and manage layouts is a significant undertaking, potentially requiring 1-2 months of focused learning[1].

3. **API Integration**: Understanding how to work with APIs, make HTTP requests, and handle responses is another crucial skill. This could take 2-4 weeks to grasp the basics[1].

4. **Asynchronous Programming**: The app uses threads for background tasks. Asynchronous programming concepts are advanced and might take 3-4 weeks to understand and implement correctly[1].

5. **File Handling and OS Operations**: The script involves working with files, directories, and system operations. These concepts could take 2-3 weeks to learn and apply effectively[1].

6. **Error Handling and Debugging**: Developing robust error handling and debugging skills is essential for creating a functional application. This is an ongoing process but could take 2-3 weeks to get comfortable with[1].

7. **Project Structure and Best Practices**: Learning how to structure a larger project, write clean code, and follow Python best practices is crucial. This aspect of development often comes with experience and could take several months to develop[1].

8. **Third-party Libraries**: Familiarizing yourself with various libraries used in the project (e.g., keyring, OpenAI) would require additional time, possibly 2-3 weeks[1].

Given these factors, it would likely take you anywhere from 6 months to a year of consistent learning and practice to be able to create an application of this complexity from scratch. However, this timeline can vary greatly depending on your prior programming experience, learning pace, and the amount of time you can dedicate to studying and practicing Python development.
