# Prompt

Are there any GUIs for Fedora that aim to simplify converting between document formats and which perhaps use Pandoc? For instance, I'd like a GUI to convert markdown to PDF with intelligent formatting - one doc at a time and possibly to run that process in batches. Anything that would do this?

# Output
Yes, there are several GUI tools on **Fedora** that simplify document format conversions, including those that use **Pandoc** for converting Markdown to PDF with intelligent formatting. Here are some of the most relevant options:
