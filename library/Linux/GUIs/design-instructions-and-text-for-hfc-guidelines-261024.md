#### **Design Guidance**

1. **Layout**:
   - **Use a grid layout** with clear divisions:
     - Title at the top.
     - Three equal-sized columns for each priority.
     - General safety tips below the main content, separated by a horizontal line.
     - Footer at the bottom with small but legible text.
   - **Icons**:
     - Use intuitive icons for quick visual identification (e.g., üè†üõ°Ô∏è for protected spaces, üö™ for unprotected rooms).
     - Icons should be large enough to grab attention but not overwhelm the text.
   
2. **Typography**:
   - **Titles and Section Headers**: Bold, slightly larger font.
   - **Body Text**: Clean, sans-serif font that is easy to read.
   - **Highlight Important Actions**: Use bold or color to emphasize key actions (e.g., ‚ÄúKeep entrances accessible‚Äù).

3. **Color Scheme**:
   - Use **neutral colors** for the background, with **high-contrast text**.
   - Consider using **subtle color blocks** behind each priority section to visually separate them.
   - **Avoid bright colors** that might strain the eyes; opt for soft greens, blues, or greys.

4. **Icons and Visuals**:
   - Ensure icons are **simple and universally understandable**.
   - Consider adding a **simple flowchart** or graphic to guide quick decision-making, showing the process from alert to shelter selection.

5. **Spacing and Margins**:
   - Maintain **consistent spacing** between sections for readability.
   - Use **adequate margins** to avoid overstuffing the page and ensure a clean, organized look.
