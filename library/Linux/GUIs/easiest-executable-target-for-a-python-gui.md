# Prompt

I'd like to convert this into something that can be installed on linux (I use fedora). Deb, RPM, etc (AppImage). My question is: which would be the easiest to do?

# Output

Based on the information provided, here are some options for packaging your Python application for Linux, ranked from easiest to more complex:

1. AppImage

AppImage would likely be the easiest option, as it doesn't require any system-level package management and can run on most Linux distributions. You can use the python-appimage tool to create an AppImage with a single command:

```
python-appimage build app <dir_to_python_package>
```

This will bundle your Python app and its dependencies into a self-contained AppImage file that users can simply download and run.

2. RPM (for Fedora)

Since you're using Fedora, creating an RPM package would be a good native option. You can use Python's built-in setuptools to create an RPM:

1. Create a setup.py file for your project
2. Run:
   ```
   python setup.py bdist_rpm
   ```

This will generate an RPM package in the dist/ directory.

3. pip installable package

While not a system package, creating a pip-installable package is relatively straightforward and allows users to install your app with:

```
pip install your-package-name
```

4. Flatpak

Flatpak is another distribution-agnostic packaging format, but requires more setup than AppImage.

5. Debian (.deb) package

Creating a .deb package is more complex and typically used for Debian-based distributions, so it's less ideal for Fedora.

For your use case on Fedora, I would recommend either the AppImage approach for simplicity and wide compatibility, or the RPM approach for a native Fedora package. AppImage would be the easiest to create and distribute, while RPM would integrate better with Fedora's package management system.
