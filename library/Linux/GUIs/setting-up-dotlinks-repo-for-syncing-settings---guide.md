# Prompt

Let's go with the dotfiles repo approach. I'd like to create it within my main Git folder to keep everything in one place. That's /home/daniel/Git

Can you give me a tutorial on how to do the symlink setup to get going with this? Let's set up newsboat that way

# Output

If you move the **dotfiles** repository to a new location on your local machine, the existing **symlinks** that point to the old location will break, because symlinks are absolute by default. This means they directly reference the full path to the target directory, so if the path changes, the symlink will point to a non-existent location.

### What Happens:
- For example, if your symlink `~/.newsboat` was pointing to `/home/daniel/Git/dotfiles/newsboat`, and you move the `dotfiles` repo to, say, `/home/daniel/Documents/dotfiles`, the symlink will still point to the old path (`/home/daniel/Git/dotfiles/newsboat`), which no longer exists.
  
### How to Fix Symlinks After Moving the Dotfiles Repo

After moving the `dotfiles` repository to a new location, you’ll need to **update the symlinks** to point to the new path. Here’s how you can do it:

#### Step 1: Move the Dotfiles Repo to the New Location
- Let’s assume you’re moving the dotfiles repo from `/home/daniel/Git/dotfiles` to `/home/daniel/Documents/dotfiles`.

```bash
mv /home/daniel/Git/dotfiles /home/daniel/Documents/dotfiles
```

#### Step 2: Remove the Old Symlinks
- First, you need to **remove the old, broken symlink**. It’s important to only remove the symlink, not the actual files.
  
```bash
rm ~/.newsboat
```

- This removes the symlink but does not affect the original files in the dotfiles repo.

#### Step 3: Create New Symlinks with the Updated Path
- Now that the symlink is removed, create a **new symlink** pointing to the new location of your dotfiles repo.

```bash
ln -s /home/daniel/Documents/dotfiles/newsboat ~/.newsboat
```

- This recreates the symlink, but now it points to the new path `/home/daniel/Documents/dotfiles/newsboat` instead of the old one.

#### Step 4: Verify the New Symlink
- You can verify that the new symlink is working by listing it and checking that it points to the new path.

```bash
ls -l ~/.newsboat
```

You should see something like:

```
.newsboat -> /home/daniel/Documents/dotfiles/newsboat
```

#### Step 5: Repeat for Other Symlinks (If Needed)
- If you have other symlinks (for example, for `.bashrc`, `.vimrc`, etc.), you’ll need to repeat this process for each one.

### Optional: Use Relative Symlinks

Alternatively, you can use **relative symlinks** instead of absolute ones. This way, if you move the dotfiles repository around within the same directory structure, the symlinks remain valid as long as the relative path between the symlink and the target stays the same.

To create a **relative symlink**, navigate to the directory where you want the symlink (e.g., `~` for your home directory) and create the symlink using a relative path:

```bash
ln -s ../Documents/dotfiles/newsboat ~/.newsboat
```

This way, as long as the relative path between the home directory and the dotfiles folder remains the same (i.e., `../Documents/dotfiles`), the symlink will stay valid even if the `dotfiles` folder moves within the same relative location.

### Conclusion

If you move your dotfiles repository to a new location on your local machine, you’ll need to update the symlinks to reflect the new path. Removing and recreating the symlinks (as shown) is the cleanest approach, and it ensures everything is properly linked. If you anticipate moving your dotfiles around frequently, using **relative symlinks** might be a good solution.
