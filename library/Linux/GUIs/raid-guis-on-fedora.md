Yes, there are a few GUI tools available on Fedora that can help you monitor and manage **BTRFS RAID performance**. These tools allow you to visualize the state of your BTRFS RAID array, track performance, and manage the filesystem without having to rely on the command line. Here are some options you can use:

### 1. **btrfsmaintenance-gui**
   - **Description**: A GUI tool specifically designed for managing and monitoring BTRFS filesystems. It can help monitor the health of BTRFS RAID arrays and also manage maintenance tasks like scrub, defragmentation, and balance.
   - **Installation**:
     ```bash
     sudo dnf install btrfsmaintenance-gui
     ```
   - **Key Features**:
     - Provides an easy interface for scheduling and running **BTRFS maintenance tasks** (scrub, balance, etc.).
     - Displays **filesystem status** and **disk usage** in a user-friendly way.
     - Allows monitoring **BTRFS RAID health** and tracking any disk failures or errors.

### 2. **KDE Partition Manager**
   - **Description**: KDE Partition Manager is a powerful tool for managing partitions and filesystems, including BTRFS. While it’s more of a partition manager, it does have basic BTRFS management capabilities, including RAID setup and status monitoring.
   - **Installation**:
     ```bash
     sudo dnf install partitionmanager
     ```
   - **Key Features**:
     - Allows you to **inspect and manage BTRFS RAID arrays**.
     - Supports **visual partitioning** and **RAID configuration** for BTRFS.
     - Provides detailed **filesystem and RAID information** for each device.

### 3. **GNOME Disks (gnome-disk-utility)**
   - **Description**: GNOME Disks is a general-purpose disk management utility that is part of the GNOME desktop environment. It can be used to inspect RAID arrays, though its BTRFS-specific RAID management capabilities are limited.
   - **Installation**:
     GNOME Disks is typically pre-installed on Fedora Workstation (if you're using GNOME), but if it's not:
     ```bash
     sudo dnf install gnome-disk-utility
     ```
   - **Key Features**:
     - Provides a simple interface to **monitor disk health** using **S.M.A.R.T.** data, which can be useful for RAID monitoring.
     - Lists all devices, including those part of RAID arrays, and gives **basic filesystem and usage information**.
     - Although not a BTRFS-specific tool, it can provide useful data on individual drives in your RAID setup.

### 4. **btrfs-assistant**
   - **Description**: **btrfs-assistant** is a simple Qt-based GUI for managing BTRFS filesystems. It allows you to monitor and perform basic operations on your BTRFS RAID setup.
   - **Installation**:
     ```bash
     sudo dnf copr enable dcantrell/btrfsassistant
     sudo dnf install btrfs-assistant
     ```
   - **Key Features**:
     - View **disk usage and RAID configuration**.
     - Monitor **BTRFS balance**, **scrub**, and **filesystem status**.
     - Perform **filesystem checks** and basic maintenance tasks from the GUI.

### 5. **Snapper (with GUI)**:
   - **Description**: **Snapper** is a tool for managing and monitoring BTRFS snapshots, which can also be useful in a RAID setup to track the state of your filesystem over time.
   - **Installation**:
     ```bash
     sudo dnf install snapper-gui
     ```
   - **Key Features**:
     - Manage BTRFS snapshots, which can help you track changes in your RAID filesystem.
     - Restore files and directories from snapshots if needed.
     - Use the GUI to **monitor snapshots**, which can help you assess the stability of your RAID setup.

### Combining GUI Tools with Command-Line Monitoring:
For advanced performance monitoring, you may also want to complement these GUIs with command-line tools like `btrfs-progs` for detailed performance metrics and status reports:
   ```bash
   sudo dnf install btrfs-progs
   ```
This will provide you with tools like `btrfs device stats`, `btrfs scrub`, and `btrfs filesystem df` that you can use to supplement the GUI’s output for more detailed reports.

### Monitoring with Performance Tools:
In addition to these BTRFS-specific GUIs, you can also use general Linux performance monitoring tools like:

1. **Gnome System Monitor**: Provides an overview of CPU, memory, and disk I/O usage.
2. **KSysGuard**: Similar to GNOME System Monitor but for KDE users.
3. **IOTop**: Command-line tool that allows you to track disk I/O, which can be useful for monitoring RAID performance.

### Summary of Tools:
- **btrfsmaintenance-gui**: Best for BTRFS-specific maintenance and monitoring.
- **KDE Partition Manager**: Offers a good balance of partition management and BTRFS RAID support.
- **GNOME Disks**: General disk monitoring tool with basic RAID and filesystem management capabilities.
- **btrfs-assistant**: Lightweight, BTRFS-focused GUI.
- **Snapper (GUI)**: Useful for managing BTRFS snapshots in a RAID setup.

These tools will help you monitor the performance and health of your RAID array and give you a better understanding of the filesystem status.
