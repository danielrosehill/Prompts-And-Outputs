Here are the GUI options for Restic that are compatible with Fedora:

### 3. **QRestic (Less Maintained)**

   - **Features**:
     - Basic backup and restore tasks

     ```
   - **Note**: QRestic is not as actively maintained, so consider this if your needs are simpler and Vorta doesn’t suit you.

### 4. **ReQrest (Experimental, Web-Based)**
   - **Description**: ReQrest is a newer web-based GUI for Restic, allowing you to manage backup tasks from your browser. While it's still in an experimental stage, it can be installed on Fedora using Docker, giving you a centralized backup management interface.

     ```
   - **Recommendation**: Suitable if you prefer a web-based solution and don’t mind using Docker. Note that this project is still experimental.

### Recommendation:
- **For Most Users**: **Vorta** is the best choice. It is well-maintained, feature-rich, and integrates nicely with Linux desktops, including Fedora. Easy to install via `dnf` or `Flatpak`.

- **If You Prefer Web-Based Management**: **ReQrest** can be a good option, especially for managing backups from multiple devices.
