# Prompt

Could you write me a guide on how to setup rear for creating a bootable backup of my operating system? The backup target is an SSD at /mnt/desktop-backups. So it's important that /mnt be excluded when creating the backup. I'd like the backup and recovery medium to be one and the same (the SSD)?

# Setting Up Relax-and-Recover (ReaR) to Create a Bootable Backup on an SSD

This guide will help you set up **Relax-and-Recover (ReaR)** to create a bootable backup of your Fedora system. The backup will be stored on an external SSD mounted at `/mnt/desktop-backups`. We will also ensure that `/mnt` is excluded during the backup, and the SSD will function as both the backup target and recovery medium.

### Prerequisites
- Fedora is installed on your system.
- An external SSD is mounted at `/mnt/desktop-backups`.
- Sufficient storage on the SSD to store your entire system.
- Root privileges on the system.

### Step 1: Install ReaR
First, you need to install ReaR. Open a terminal and run the following command:

```bash
sudo dnf install rear
```

### Step 2: Configure ReaR
ReaR uses a configuration file located at `/etc/rear/local.conf` to determine how to back up your system. We will edit this file to match your setup.

1. **Open the Configuration File**:

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/rear/local.conf
   ```

2. **Add the Following Configuration**:

   ```bash
   # Basic ReaR Configuration
   OUTPUT=ISO
   BACKUP=NETFS
   BACKUP_URL=file:///mnt/desktop-backups
   EXCLUDE_MOUNTPOINTS=( '/mnt' )

   # Create a Bootable Recovery ISO
   OUTPUT_URL=file:///mnt/desktop-backups

   # Ensure Grub and EFI Settings Are Backed Up
   GRUB_RESCUE=1
   ``
   
   - **OUTPUT=ISO**: Specifies that the output should be a bootable ISO image.
   - **BACKUP=NETFS**: This instructs ReaR to use filesystem-level backups.
   - **BACKUP_URL=file:///mnt/desktop-backups**: Specifies that the backup should be saved to the external SSD.
   - **EXCLUDE_MOUNTPOINTS=( '/mnt' )**: Ensures that the `/mnt` directory is excluded from the backup to avoid a recursive backup issue.
   - **OUTPUT_URL=file:///mnt/desktop-backups**: This makes sure that the bootable ISO is also saved to the external SSD so that it can be used as recovery media.
   - **GRUB_RESCUE=1**: Ensures that GRUB and EFI settings are saved, making the recovery medium bootable.

3. **Save and Close the File**: Press `CTRL + O` to save and `CTRL + X` to exit.

### Step 3: Create the Bootable Backup
Now that the configuration is in place, you can use ReaR to create the bootable backup.

1. **Create the Recovery ISO and Backup**:

   Run the following command to start the backup process:
   
   ```bash
   sudo rear mkbackup
   ```

   - This command will create a full backup of your system (excluding `/mnt`) and will create a bootable ISO image that is saved directly to `/mnt/desktop-backups` on your SSD.
   - Depending on the size of your system, this process may take some time.

2. **Verify the Backup**:

   Once the process is complete, navigate to `/mnt/desktop-backups` and verify that you see both the backup files and an ISO image. The ISO is the bootable recovery medium that you will use to restore the system if needed.

### Step 4: Test the Bootable Backup
To make sure the recovery media works, it's a good idea to test booting from the ISO.

1. **Prepare to Boot from the SSD**:
   - Restart your computer and enter your BIOS or UEFI settings (usually by pressing `F2`, `DEL`, or `ESC` during startup).
   - Change the boot order so that the external SSD is selected as the first boot device.

2. **Boot into Recovery Environment**:
   - Once booted, you should be presented with the ReaR recovery menu.
   - From here, you can proceed with the recovery process or exit to confirm that the bootable media is functional.

### Step 5: Restoring Your System
If your original system becomes unusable, you can restore it using the ReaR backup.

1. **Boot from the SSD**: Plug in your external SSD and boot into the ReaR recovery environment, as described in the previous step.

2. **Restore the Backup**:
   - In the ReaR menu, select the option to **recover** the system.
   - ReaR will locate the backup stored on the SSD and begin the restoration process.
   - Follow the on-screen prompts to proceed. The tool will recreate your partitions and restore all of the backed-up data to your new or repaired hardware.

### Notes
- **Make Sure the SSD is Always Properly Mounted**: Before running the backup command (`rear mkbackup`), ensure that your SSD is mounted at `/mnt/desktop-backups`.
- **Recovery Medium Limitations**: Since the SSD serves as both backup storage and recovery medium, make sure there is enough storage capacity to hold all of your data plus the recovery ISO.
- **Test Regularly**: Itâ€™s a good practice to test your recovery process periodically to ensure that you can successfully restore your system if needed.

### Summary
1. **Install ReaR** using `dnf`.
2. **Configure ReaR** in `/etc/rear/local.conf` to specify the backup and exclude `/mnt`.
3. **Create a Bootable Backup** using the `rear mkbackup` command.
4. **Test the Recovery Medium** by booting from the SSD.
5. Use the recovery environment to **restore your system** when necessary.

By following these steps, you'll have a reliable, bootable backup of your Fedora system on an SSD that can also function as recovery media, providing a straightforward recovery path if your system ever fails.
