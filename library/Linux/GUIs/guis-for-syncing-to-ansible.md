# Prompt

Let's give the Git approach a try. But firstly ... are there any GUIs for my Fedora Linux computer that could allow me to manage my Ansible syncs graphically?

# Output

Based on your request for a GUI to manage Ansible syncs on your Fedora Linux computer, there are a few options available. One notable solution that stands out is Semaphore UI, which is specifically designed for Ansible management:

## Semaphore UI

Semaphore UI (formerly Ansible Semaphore) is a modern, open-source UI for Ansible that can be installed on your Fedora workstation.

**Key features:**
- Easy running of Ansible playbooks
- Notifications for failed tasks
- Access control for the deployment system
- Web-based interface

**Installation on Fedora:**

1. Install Docker (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   sudo dnf install docker
   sudo systemctl start docker
   sudo systemctl enable docker
   ```

2. Use Docker to run Semaphore:
   ```bash
   docker run -d --name semaphore -p 3000:3000 semaphoreui/semaphore:latest
   ```

3. Access Semaphore through your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`

Semaphore UI provides a user-friendly interface for managing your Ansible playbooks and can be a good option for graphically managing your Ansible syncs on your Fedora workstation[3].

## Alternative: AWX

While AWX is typically used in larger environments, it can be installed on a local machine for testing and personal use:

1. Install prerequisites:
   ```bash
   sudo dnf install git docker docker-compose ansible
   ```

2. Clone the AWX repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ansible/awx.git
   cd awx
   ```

3. Run the installation playbook:
   ```bash
   cd installer
   ansible-playbook -i inventory install.yml
   ```

4. Access AWX via your web browser at `http://localhost`

AWX provides a comprehensive web-based interface for managing Ansible, but it may be more resource-intensive than Semaphore for a personal workstation[4].

For your use case of syncing between a desktop and laptop, Semaphore UI might be a more lightweight and suitable option. It allows you to manage your Ansible playbooks graphically while still maintaining the simplicity needed for personal use.

Remember to store your Ansible playbooks in a Git repository for version control and easy syncing between your machines. You can then use Semaphore UI to run these playbooks on both your desktop and laptop as needed.
