# Prompt
Please provide a comprehensive overview of tools that are intended to speed up developing admin panels which can perform CRUD operations on a Postgres dastabase. To get you started in the right direction, here are a few projects that I think look good (I don't want no code tools): Laravel Nova, Laravel Filament, Laravel Backpack. Can you find some more? They don't just have to be PHP!

# Input

That was great until the last section (cross platform solutions). Because those are low code. Can you think of any others you might not have covered?

# Output

I apologize for the confusion in my previous response. You're right that the cross-platform solutions mentioned were more low-code oriented, which doesn't align with your request for code-based tools. Let me provide some additional code-based tools that I may not have covered earlier:

## Additional Code-Based Admin Panel Tools

### Rust-based Solution
