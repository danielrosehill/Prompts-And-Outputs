To sanitize the filenames and remove any characters that might cause issues during the import process, you can use a script that renames the files by replacing or removing problematic characters. Common problematic characters might include spaces, punctuation (like colons, slashes, quotes), and special symbols.

### Suggested Bash Script:
The following script will rename files by:
1. Replacing spaces with underscores (`_`)
2. Removing special characters that are typically problematic in file names (like `/`, `\`, `:`, `*`, `?`, `"`, `<`, `>`, `|`)
3. Converting uppercase letters to lowercase (optional, but can help maintain consistency)

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Define the directory containing your markdown files
DIRECTORY="./current-notes"

# Replace or remove problematic characters from filenames
find "$DIRECTORY" -type f | while read -r FILE; do
    # Get the directory and the base filename
    DIRNAME=$(dirname "$FILE")
    BASENAME=$(basename "$FILE")

    # Create a sanitized version of the filename
    SANITIZED_NAME=$(echo "$BASENAME" | tr ' ' '_' | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | sed 's/[^a-zA-Z0-9._-]//g')

    # Only rename if the sanitized name is different from the original
    if [[ "$BASENAME" != "$SANITIZED_NAME" ]]; then
        mv "$FILE" "$DIRNAME/$SANITIZED_NAME"
        echo "Renamed: $BASENAME -> $SANITIZED_NAME"
    fi
done

echo "Filenames sanitized."
```

### How It Works:
1. **Replaces Spaces**: The `tr ' ' '_'` command replaces spaces with underscores.
2. **Lowercase Conversion**: The `tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'` command converts all uppercase letters to lowercase.
3. **Remove Problematic Characters**: The `sed 's/[^a-zA-Z0-9._-]//g'` command removes any characters that are not letters, numbers, dots, underscores, or hyphens.

### Instructions:
1. Save the script as `sanitize_filenames.sh`.
2. Make it executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x sanitize_filenames.sh
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   ./sanitize_filenames.sh
   ```

### Customization:
- **If you donâ€™t want to convert to lowercase**, you can remove the `tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'` part.
- **To replace rather than remove certain characters**, you can adjust the `sed` command. For example, if you want to replace `&` with `and`, you could add another `sed` operation like:
  ```bash
  sed 's/&/and/g'
  ```

This script should help ensure your filenames are compatible and won't cause issues during import into a new system. Let me know if you need any additional modifications!
