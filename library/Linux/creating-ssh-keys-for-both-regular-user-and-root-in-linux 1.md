# Prompt

If I create SSH keys with both my regular username and with root in Linux, will they be stored in separate directories so that conflicts aren't created?

# Output

Yes, if you create SSH keys for both your regular user (`daniel`) and the `root` user, they will be stored in separate directories, so there won't be any conflicts. Each user's SSH keys are kept in their own home directory.

### Default Locations for SSH Keys:
1. **Regular User (`daniel`)**:
   - SSH keys are stored in: `/home/daniel/.ssh/`
   - Example: `/home/daniel/.ssh/id_rsa` (private key) and `/home/daniel/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` (public key)

2. **Root User (`root`)**:
   - SSH keys are stored in: `/root/.ssh/`
   - Example: `/root/.ssh/id_rsa` (private key) and `/root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` (public key)

### Explanation:
- Each user, including `root`, has their own home directory, and the `.ssh` folder is located within that directory. This means there is no overlap or conflict between the SSH keys of different users.
- **When Running as `sudo`**: If you generate SSH keys while running as `sudo`, they will be placed in `/root/.ssh/` because `sudo` switches the environment to `root`. Conversely, when generating keys as your regular user, they will be stored in `/home/daniel/.ssh/`.

### Generating Separate SSH Keys:
1. **As Regular User (`daniel`)**:
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "daniel@hostname"
   ```
   - Keys will be saved in `/home/daniel/.ssh/`.

2. **As `root`**:
   ```bash
   sudo ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "root@hostname"
   ```
   - Keys will be saved in `/root/.ssh/`.

### Avoiding Conflicts:
- Since SSH keys are tied to the user's home directory, having keys for both `daniel` and `root` won't cause conflicts. You can even name them differently if you wish to manage multiple keys.
- Be mindful of which user you're logged in as (or using `sudo`) when generating or managing keys to ensure they end up in the correct directory.

In summary, creating SSH keys for different users in Linux does not lead to conflicts, as they are stored separately within each userâ€™s `.ssh` directory.
