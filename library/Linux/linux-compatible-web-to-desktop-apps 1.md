Certainly! Here's a comprehensive list of the Linux-compatible tools I've mentioned for converting web applications to desktop apps or managing web apps on the desktop:

1. WebCatalog: A cross-platform application that turns websites into desktop apps, supporting Linux, macOS, and Windows.

2. Nativefier: An open-source command-line tool that creates desktop applications for any website using Electron, compatible with Linux, macOS, and Windows.

3. Webapp Manager: A Linux-specific tool that allows running websites as apps using various browsers. It's particularly popular among Linux Mint users but can be installed on other Ubuntu-based distributions.

4. Rambox: While primarily a workspace organizer, it allows you to add web apps to a single interface and is available for Linux.

5. Firework: A tool for converting web apps into desktop apps, which is compatible with Linux systems.

6. ToDesktop: This tool can create desktop apps from web applications and supports Linux, though it's primarily aimed at developers creating apps for distribution rather than personal use.
