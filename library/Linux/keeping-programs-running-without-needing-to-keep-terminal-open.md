# Prompt

I often need to execute a program from the command line in fedora. how can i execute the program in a way that allow me to close the terminal without interrupting the session?

# Output

To run a program in the background on Fedora and close the terminal without interrupting the session, you can use several methods:

1. **Nohup Command:**
   - Use `nohup` to run a command immune to hangup signals, allowing it to continue running after the terminal is closed.
   - Example: `nohup your_command &`
   - Output is redirected to `nohup.out` by default.

2. **Tmux or Screen:**
   - These are terminal multiplexers that let you run sessions independently of the terminal.
   - Install Tmux with: `sudo dnf install tmux`
   - Start a session with: `tmux`
   - Detach with `Ctrl+b` followed by `d`, and reattach with `tmux attach`.

3. **Disown Command:**
   - Run a process in the background and then disown it to detach it from the terminal.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     your_command &
     disown
     ```

4. **Ampersand (&):**
   - Simply add `&` at the end of your command to run it in the background.
   - Note: Closing the terminal will still terminate the process unless combined with `nohup` or `disown`.

These methods allow you to keep processes running independently of your terminal session.
