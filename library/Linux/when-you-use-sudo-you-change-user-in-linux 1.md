Yes, when you use `sudo` to run a command, you are effectively running that command as the `root` user. This means that any environment settings, permissions, and file paths will be those of the `root` user instead of your normal user account (`daniel`).

### What Happens When You Use `sudo`:
1. **Environment and Permissions**:
   - When you run a command with `sudo`, it executes with `root`'s permissions, which allows it to access files and perform actions that your regular user might not have permission to do.
   - The environment variables, home directory, and file paths used will be those of the `root` user. For example:
     - Your normal home directory is `/home/daniel`, but when running `sudo`, the home directory becomes `/root`.
     - SSH keys will be looked for in `/root/.ssh` instead of `/home/daniel/.ssh`.

2. **Why This Matters**:
   - If you run `sudo ssh-copy-id`, it looks for SSH keys under `/root/.ssh` and won’t find your `daniel` user's keys.
   - Similarly, if you run `sudo` commands to modify files, those files might end up being owned by `root`, which could cause permission issues later.

### Running as Your Normal User vs. `sudo`:
- **Normal User**: Executes commands with your user’s permissions, using your home directory, environment variables, and settings.
- **`sudo`**: Elevates permissions to `root`, running commands as if you were logged in as the `root` user, with `root`'s environment and home directory.

### Avoid Using `sudo` Unless Necessary:
Only use `sudo` when you need elevated permissions. If you don’t need those permissions, running commands as your normal user is generally safer and avoids complications with file ownership and environment settings.

For your specific case, run `ssh-copy-id` without `sudo` to ensure it uses your existing SSH keys.
