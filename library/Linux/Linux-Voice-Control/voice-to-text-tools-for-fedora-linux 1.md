# Prompt

are there any voice to text tools that can run on fedora linux (locally) and which are actually reliable enough to be useful (and which may come close to approximating the quality of cloud native voice to text)?

# Output

There are a few voice-to-text tools that can run locally on Fedora Linux and offer decent transcription quality, although cloud-native solutions like Google or Otter.ai generally provide superior accuracy. Here are some options worth exploring:

1. **Vosk**:
   - **Vosk** is an open-source offline speech recognition toolkit that can run on Fedora. It supports multiple languages and provides relatively high accuracy, though not on par with cloud services. It works with Python and can be integrated into various projects.
   - Installation: Vosk is available via Python and can be set up by installing the Vosk API through pip:
     ```
     pip install vosk
     ```
   - You can also download the language model files locally, so everything runs offline.

2. **Coqui STT (formerly Mozilla DeepSpeech)**:
   - **Coqui STT** is a deep learning-based speech-to-text engine that runs locally. While it requires some computing power for installation and operation, it offers good accuracy, especially with custom training. The performance can vary depending on the pre-trained model you use or if you fine-tune it for your needs.
   - Installation:
     ```
     pip install coqui-stt
     ```
   - It's an excellent choice for open-source, offline speech-to-text.

3. **Julius**:
   - **Julius** is a highly efficient, open-source speech recognition engine that can be used locally. It’s lightweight and suitable for low-power devices, although the accuracy may not be as high as cloud-based tools.
   - Installation on Fedora requires compiling from source, which can be a bit more technical but is doable if you’re comfortable with Linux.

4. **Kaldi**:
   - **Kaldi** is a state-of-the-art speech recognition toolkit that's often used for academic research. It requires a significant amount of setup and is somewhat complex to use, but with the right configuration and models, it can be quite powerful and accurate.
   - It's not plug-and-play like some of the other options, but if you're looking for highly customizable and sophisticated speech-to-text, Kaldi could be worth the investment of time.

5. **Whisper (OpenAI)**:
   - **Whisper** is an open-source model released by OpenAI that can be used for speech-to-text transcription and runs locally. It requires more powerful hardware (like a GPU) but offers surprisingly good transcription accuracy, approaching the quality of cloud-based solutions.
   - Installation via Python:
     ```
     pip install openai-whisper
     ```
   - This may be the closest approximation to cloud-native performance.

For a Fedora setup, **Vosk** and **Whisper** are your best bets for balancing accuracy and ease of use. Whisper, in particular, is likely to give you the best results, especially if you have the necessary hardware to run it smoothly.
