Yes, the **Audio-Technica AT2020** would generally be more sensitive and better suited for voice typing from a distance compared to the **Samson Q2U**.

### Why the AT2020 is Better for This Use Case:

1. **Higher Sensitivity**: The AT2020 is a **condenser microphone** with a sensitivity rating of **-37 dBV/Pa (14.1 mV/Pa)**, which is significantly higher than the Samson Q2U's sensitivity of **-54 dBV/Pa**. This means the AT2020 can pick up quieter sounds more easily and requires less gain to capture clear audio, making it better suited for capturing your voice even if the microphone is placed further away on your desk\[2]\[3].
2. **Condenser vs Dynamic**: As a condenser microphone, the AT2020 is inherently more sensitive to subtle sounds and details compared to dynamic microphones like the Q2U. This makes it better at picking up your voice clearly from a desk position without needing to be as close to your mouth\[4].
3. **Frequency Response**: The AT2020 has a wider frequency response (20 Hz - 20 kHz) compared to the Q2U (50 Hz - 15 kHz), which helps capture a fuller range of vocal tones, especially at a distance\[1]\[3]. This ensures that even when placed on a desk, your voice will still sound natural and clear.

### Potential Downsides:

- **Background Noise**: The higher sensitivity of the AT2020 also means it is more likely to pick up background noise (e.g., keyboard typing or room noises), so you may need some level of acoustic treatment or a quiet environment for optimal results\[4].
- **Phantom Power Required**: The AT2020 requires **48V phantom power**, which means you'll need an audio interface or mixer that provides this power, unlike the Q2U, which can work via USB without additional equipment\[4].

### Conclusion:

For voice typing from a desk setup, the **Audio-Technica AT2020** would generally perform better than the Samson Q2U due to its higher sensitivity and ability to capture more detail from further away. However, be mindful of potential background noise and the need for phantom power.
