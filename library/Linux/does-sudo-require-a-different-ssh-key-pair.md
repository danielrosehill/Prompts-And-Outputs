I already have an SSH key pair generated on my Fedora desktop, but when I try to run sudo ssh-copy-id it indicates that there is no SSH key pair. Is that because when I try to run the command as sudo it's a different user?

# Output

Yes, that's correct. When you run `sudo ssh-copy-id`, it's executing the command as the `root` user, which means it’s looking for the SSH key pair in the `root` user's `.ssh` directory (`/root/.ssh/`) instead of your user’s `.ssh` directory (`/home/daniel/.ssh/`). Since the SSH keys are located under your `daniel` user's home directory, `sudo` won’t find them.

### Solution: Use `ssh-copy-id` Without `sudo`
To copy your existing SSH key to the Ubuntu server, you should run `ssh-copy-id` as your regular `daniel` user:

```bash
ssh-copy-id daniel@192.168.1.1
```

### Explanation:
- **No `sudo` Needed**: Since your SSH key is under `/home/daniel/.ssh/`, running `ssh-copy-id` without `sudo` will correctly use the existing keys.
- **Why `sudo` Fails**: When using `sudo`, it switches to the root environment, which doesn’t have your `daniel` user’s SSH keys, leading to the "No identities found" error.

### Verify and Test:
1. **Run the Command**:
   ```bash
   ssh-copy-id daniel@192.168.1.1
   ```
2. **Test the Connection**:
   ```bash
   ssh daniel@192.168.1.1
   ```

After this, you should be able to connect to the Ubuntu server without entering a password, allowing your backup script to work seamlessly.
