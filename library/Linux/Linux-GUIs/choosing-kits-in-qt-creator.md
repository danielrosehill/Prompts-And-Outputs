From the screenshot you shared, it appears that Qt Creator is showing several default build configurations under **Desktop** (Debug, Release, etc.). These are commonly used kits for desktop development.

### Here's what each kit typically represents:
- **Debug**: For debugging purposes. It includes additional information that helps you find and fix issues during development.
- **Release**: For final release builds. This kit optimizes the application for performance and strips out debugging information.
- **Release with Debug Information**: A mix of both debugging information and optimization. It allows you to release a product that can still be debugged if needed.
- **Profile**: This configuration is often used for performance profiling of the application to help identify performance bottlenecks.
- **Minimum Size Release**: Optimized for smaller binary sizes, useful when disk or memory space is limited.

### Recommendation:
You should **stick with the default options** that are already checked. These kits provide a balanced set of build configurations for development, debugging, and release. 

If you're just starting, you’ll likely use **Debug** for testing and **Release** when you're ready to distribute or run the app with better performance. You don’t need to add or modify any kits manually unless you have specific needs for other platforms or configurations.
