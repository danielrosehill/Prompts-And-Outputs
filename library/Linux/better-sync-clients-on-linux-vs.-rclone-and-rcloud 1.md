# Prompt

For syncing to and from clouds on Linux based systems like Fedora, rclone and rcloud are the typical recommendations. However, they don't have good GUIs and aren't the most user friendly. Are there better tools for managing sync with object based storage pools such as b2 and s3?

# Output

If you're looking for more user-friendly tools with good GUIs for managing sync with object-based storage pools like B2 and S3 on Linux-based systems like Fedora, here are some alternatives to consider:

### 1. **Cyberduck**
