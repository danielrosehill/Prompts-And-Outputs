# Prompt

Let's say that I store my content in Obsidian unencrypted. But I want to encrypt it before it egresses my network and it syncs to a cloud (and decrypt it only when it arrives at my local machine). Any tools that could do this and what storage could I use?

# Output

I understand better now—you’re interested in a **gateway solution** that transparently **encrypts data in transit** to and from your **cloud storage** while leaving the data unencrypted when it is at rest locally. Essentially, you'd want a system that works like a **reverse proxy or middleware layer**, encrypting and decrypting data transparently before and after it touches the cloud. Here are some solutions and strategies that can help achieve this:

### **Solutions for Creating a Gateway Encryption Layer**

1. **MinIO with Client-Side Encryption**
   - **Description**: **MinIO** is an open-source, high-performance object storage that is **S3-compatible**. It can be configured as a **gateway** for cloud storage like AWS S3, Backblaze B2, or Wasabi.
   - **How It Works**:
     - **MinIO Gateway** mode works as an intermediary, allowing you to use it with existing S3-compatible cloud storage.
     - You can set up **client-side encryption** with MinIO before the data is sent to the backend cloud storage.
   - **Pros**:
     - Transparent encryption/decryption without altering your data locally.
     - Compatible with most **S3 APIs**.
   - **Link**: [MinIO Gateway Documentation](https://min.io/docs/minio/linux/reference/minio-gateway.html)

2. **rclone Mount with Crypt Remote**
   - **Description**: **rclone** can act as a virtual **gateway** to cloud storage with encryption handled at the client side. By using **rclone mount**, you can mount a cloud storage bucket as a local drive, where all operations (upload/download) are **encrypted/decrypted** automatically.
   - **How It Works**:
     - Configure an **rclone crypt remote** that points to your cloud storage.
     - Use the `rclone mount` command to mount the remote as a **local directory**.
     - Any data written to the mounted directory is **encrypted** before being sent to the cloud, and data read is **decrypted** transparently.
   - **Pros**:
     - Files are stored unencrypted locally but encrypted transparently in the cloud.
     - Works with most **S3-compatible** storage services.

3. **Cloudflare Tunnels with Workers for Encryption**
   - **Description**: **Cloudflare Tunnels** can create a secure connection between your local machine and the cloud, and **Cloudflare Workers** can act as a transformation layer to handle **encryption/decryption** before data reaches the storage backend.
   - **How It Works**:
     - Use **Cloudflare Tunnel** to create a secure connection to the cloud.
     - Deploy **Cloudflare Workers** to handle **encryption** before data is written and **decryption** before data is read.
   - **Pros**:
     - **Serverless** and scalable encryption with no need for dedicated infrastructure.
     - Cloudflare’s infrastructure ensures low latency and high reliability.

4. **S3Proxy with Encryption**
   - **Description**: **S3Proxy** is an open-source proxy that allows you to expose a storage backend via the **S3 API**. You can add **encryption** to the proxy layer, making it act as an encryption/decryption gateway.
   - **How It Works**:
     - Deploy **S3Proxy** to act as an intermediary between your client (e.g., Obsidian) and the cloud storage.
     - Add a custom encryption layer to S3Proxy to **encrypt data** before it is sent to the storage backend.
   - **Pros**:
     - Full **S3 API compatibility** means you can use tools like the AWS CLI without modification.
     - You can use any **S3-compatible** storage backend.

5. **HashiCorp Vault with Encryption-as-a-Service**
   - **Description**: **HashiCorp Vault** can be used as an encryption-as-a-service tool to **encrypt data** before it is stored in the cloud. This works by using Vault to generate and manage **encryption keys** and **encrypt data** on its way to cloud storage.
   - **How It Works**:
     - Data is **encrypted** using HashiCorp Vault before being uploaded.
     - Set up a script or proxy that automatically sends data through Vault to encrypt/decrypt as needed.
   - **Pros**:
     - Centralized key management with **audit logs**.
     - Offers **advanced policies** to control access and encryption.
   - **Link**: [HashiCorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/)

6. **OpenZFS with ZFS Send/Receive and Encryption**
   - **Description**: **OpenZFS** supports **send/receive** operations with **encryption**, allowing you to encrypt data before it’s sent over the network to cloud storage.
   - **How It Works**:
     - Create an **encrypted ZFS dataset**.
     - Use the **ZFS send** command to send an encrypted version of the dataset to cloud storage, and **receive** it locally with decryption.
   - **Pros**:
     - Transparent encryption while transferring data.
     - Can be automated via **cron jobs** or other scripting.

### **Cloud Storage Options for Gateway Encryption**
For storage options, you can use any cloud storage that supports S3 or webDAV APIs. Here are a few recommendations:

1. **Backblaze B2**
   - **Compatibility**: Works well with **MinIO**, **rclone**, or **S3Proxy**.
   - **Pros**: Low-cost, reliable, S3-compatible.

2. **Wasabi**
   - **Compatibility**: Supports **rclone** and **S3Proxy**.
   - **Pros**: S3-compatible with no egress fees, making it a good choice for frequent access.

3. **AWS S3**
   - **Compatibility**: Supports **MinIO**, **rclone**, **S3Proxy**, and **HashiCorp Vault**.
   - **Pros**: Industry-standard, scalable, and highly available.

4. **DigitalOcean Spaces**
   - **Compatibility**: Works with **rclone** or **S3Proxy**.
   - **Pros**: S3-compatible, easy to set up, and affordable.

5. **Google Cloud Storage (GCS)**
   - **Compatibility**: **rclone** can handle GCS using the **S3 gateway**.
   - **Pros**: Globally available with strong reliability and privacy compliance.

### **Summary and Recommended Approach**
If you want to create a **gateway** that encrypts and decrypts your Obsidian content transparently before it goes to the cloud, you could use:

1. **MinIO Gateway** with a cloud storage backend like **Backblaze B2** or **Wasabi**. MinIO can act as an encryption gateway that encrypts all data before sending it to S3-compatible storage.

2. **rclone with Crypt Remote**: Use **rclone mount** to mount your cloud storage as a local directory. Any data placed into this directory will be encrypted before being uploaded, and decrypted on read.

3. **S3Proxy**: Deploy an **S3Proxy** instance to serve as an **S3-compatible gateway** with an added encryption layer for handling requests between your local environment and the cloud.

Each of these approaches allows you to **store your data unencrypted locally** while ensuring that it is **encrypted in transit** and **at rest** in the cloud. The **rclone with Crypt Remote** approach is particularly popular for its simplicity, flexibility, and compatibility with a wide range of cloud storage services.
