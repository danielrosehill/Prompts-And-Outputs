![[Investing resources usage of Ubuntu VM currently.png]]
Your **Proxmox VM** is currently using a **2 TB (2000 GB) virtual disk**, even though the actual usage inside the VM is only around **21 GB**. You can reduce this disk size to something more reasonable, like **100 GB**, by following these steps. The process involves shrinking the filesystem within the VM, reducing the logical volume (LVM) size, and then resizing the disk on Proxmox.

### **Important**: Before proceeding, **back up your VM** to avoid data loss during this operation.

### Steps to Reduce Disk Size

#### 1. **Shrink the Filesystem Inside the VM**
To safely reduce the disk size, you need to first shrink the **filesystem** and **logical volume** inside the VM.

1. **Check Filesystem Type**:
   - If your root partition uses **ext4** (you can check using `df -T`), continue with the steps below.

2. **Boot into a Live CD**:
   - Reducing the root partition (the active filesystem) requires unmounting it, which means you'll need to boot the VM into a **Live CD** (such as an Ubuntu Live ISO).
   - Download the **Ubuntu Live ISO** and mount it to the VM in Proxmox.
   - Reboot the VM and boot from the Live CD.

3. **Shrink the Filesystem**:
   Once inside the Live CD, open a terminal and shrink the filesystem:
   - Use `lsblk` or `df -h` to find the root partition (e.g., `/dev/mapper/ubuntu--vg-ubuntu--lv`).
   - Shrink the **ext4 filesystem**:
     ```bash
     sudo e2fsck -f /dev/mapper/ubuntu--vg-ubuntu--lv
     sudo resize2fs /dev/mapper/ubuntu--vg-ubuntu--lv 100G  # Adjust to desired size (e.g., 100 GB)
     ```

4. **Shrink the LVM Logical Volume**:
   After shrinking the filesystem, you need to reduce the size of the **LVM logical volume**.
   ```bash
   sudo lvreduce -L 100G /dev/mapper/ubuntu--vg-ubuntu--lv  # Adjust to desired size
   ```

   Confirm the changes:
   ```bash
   sudo lvdisplay
   ```

5. **Reboot Back into the Main System**:
   - After successfully shrinking the filesystem and logical volume, reboot the VM back into its normal system.

#### 2. **Resize the Disk in Proxmox**
Now that the filesystem inside the VM has been reduced, you can adjust the disk size in Proxmox.

1. **Shutdown the VM**:
   - Ensure the VM is powered off before resizing the disk.

2. **Reduce Disk Size in Proxmox**:
   - Unfortunately, **Proxmox doesnâ€™t allow reducing the size of a disk directly via the web UI**. However, you can clone the VM and assign it a new, smaller disk.
   - **Alternative method**: You can create a new disk (e.g., 100 GB) and copy the data from the old disk to the new one using `dd` or similar methods. This approach is more complex and requires careful handling.

#### 3. **Reconfigure Proxmox (Optional)**:
- Once you've resized the disk and confirmed the VM is working correctly, you can reclaim the unused space in the **ZFS pool** or other storage backends that were previously allocated for this VM's virtual disk.

### Alternative: Create a New VM and Migrate Data
If resizing the current VM's disk seems complex, another approach is to **create a new VM** with a smaller disk (e.g., 100 GB), and then **migrate your data** from the existing VM using backup and restore tools like **rsync** or Proxmox's **VM backup feature**.

### Final Thoughts:
- **Filesystem shrinking** and **LVM resizing** are critical steps that need to be done carefully to avoid data loss.
- Always **back up your VM** before attempting these operations.

Would you like detailed guidance on one of these steps, or would you prefer to create a new VM and migrate your services?
