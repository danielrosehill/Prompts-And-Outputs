*Note: this repository consists of the outputs of large language models (LLMs). In many cases, these are unedited or minimally edited. The information provided is for demonstrative purposes only and is intended to highlight constraints and capabilities in LLM applications and prompt engineering strategies.*


# Prompt

I'm interested in hearing about the proprietary models including Star Coder. I'm looking for something specialised for this use case. Are there any more like that?
# Output

Based on your interest in specialized models for code generation, particularly proprietary ones like StarCoder, here are some notable options that cater to your use case:

## StarCoder

StarCoder is a powerful code generation model developed by Hugging Face and ServiceNow. Key features include:

- 15.5 billion parameter model with an 8K token context length[2]
- Trained on over 80 programming languages, GitHub issues, Git commits, and Jupyter notebooks[1][5]
- Outperforms many leading open-source code LLMs on popular programming benchmarks[3]
- Supports code completion, auto-fill, advanced code summarization, and natural language code snippet retrieval[3]
- Available under a permissive license allowing royalty-free use, including by corporations[4]

StarCoder's performance and specialization in code generation make it a strong contender for your needs.

## OpenAI Codex

OpenAI Codex is another specialized model for code generation:

- Powers GitHub Copilot and is available through OpenAI's API[1][6]
- Proficient in multiple programming languages, with Python being its strongest[1]
- Trained on billions of lines of public source code[6]
- Can interpret natural language commands and execute them[6]
- 14KB memory for Python code, allowing for more context than GPT-3[6]

Codex's focus on code generation and its ability to understand natural language instructions align well with your requirements.

## Code LLama

Code LLama, developed by Meta, is another powerful option:

- 70 billion parameter model, making it one of the largest available[1]
- Designed specifically for code generation tasks
- Capable of understanding complex programming tasks and generating code snippets[1]
- Trained on a diverse dataset, allowing it to work with various programming languages and frameworks

Code LLama's large size and specialization in code tasks make it a strong option for your needs.

## StarCoder2

A newer iteration of StarCoder, StarCoder2 offers some improvements:

- Available in 3B, 7B, and 15B parameter versions[3]
- 16,000 token context length, allowing for longer code bases and more elaborate instructions[3]
- Optimized with NVIDIA's TensorRT-LLM for improved inference performance[3]
- Trained on 1 trillion tokens from permissively licensed GitHub repositories[3]

StarCoder2's longer context length and optimizations could be particularly beneficial for your use case.

Given your requirements for detailed prompts, long code outputs, and a focus on Python, any of these models could potentially meet your needs. StarCoder, StarCoder2, and OpenAI Codex stand out as particularly strong options due to their specialization in code generation and ability to handle complex instructions. 

To determine the best fit, you might consider factors such as:
1. Specific performance on Python tasks
2. API availability and integration ease
3. Licensing terms and costs
4. Context window size for your typical use cases

Testing these models with your specific prompts and requirements would be the best way to determine which performs optimally for your needs.
