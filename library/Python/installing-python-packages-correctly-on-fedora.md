# Prompt

I'm installing a lot of python packages at the moment like this one. I want to make sure that I'm doing so correctly. I want to install them on my computer so that they can be used in whatever repo I'm working on. What's the correct way to do that? And is there some kind of python package manager I can work with instead of having to go into a full IDE every time?

# Output

Based on your query and the search results, I can provide you with some guidance on installing Python packages correctly and efficiently:

1. Global vs. Virtual Environments:
   While it's possible to install packages globally, it's generally recommended to use virtual environments for each project. This keeps dependencies isolated and prevents conflicts between projects. However, if you really want to install packages globally so they're available across all projects, you can do so, but be cautious about potential version conflicts.

2. Using pip:
   pip is the standard package manager for Python. You can use it to install packages globally or in virtual environments.

3. Installing packages globally:
   To install a package globally, you can use:
   ```
   python -m pip install package_name
   ```
   or
   ```
   pip install package_name
   ```

4. Virtual Environments:
   For better practice, create a virtual environment for each project:
   ```
   python -m venv myproject_env
   source myproject_env/bin/activate  # On Unix or MacOS
   myproject_env\Scripts\activate.bat  # On Windows
   ```
   Then install packages within this environment.

5. Package Manager / IDE Alternative:
   If you want to avoid using a full IDE every time, you have several options:
   
   a. Use a terminal or command prompt: You can install packages directly from the command line without needing an IDE.
   
   b. Use a package manager with a GUI: Tools like "pip-gui" provide a graphical interface for managing Python packages.
   
   c. Use a lightweight text editor with integrated terminal: Editors like Visual Studio Code or Sublime Text allow you to manage packages from an integrated terminal without the overhead of a full IDE.

6. Managing Dependencies:
   Keep track of your project dependencies using a requirements.txt file. You can create this file with:
   ```
   pip freeze > requirements.txt
   ```
   And install from it with:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

7. Updating pip:
   Ensure you're using the latest version of pip:
   ```
   python -m pip install --upgrade pip
   ```

Remember, while installing packages globally can be convenient, it's generally better practice to use virtual environments to keep your projects isolated and avoid potential conflicts between different versions of packages.
