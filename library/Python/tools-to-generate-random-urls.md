Yes, there are several tools and approaches you can use on Fedora to generate random URLs for testing purposes. Here's a simple method using command-line tools and small utilities to generate random URLs or even web services that can help with this:

### 1. **Python Script to Generate Random URLs**

You can quickly write a Python script to generate a few random URLs. This approach allows flexibility in controlling the number and structure of URLs.

#### Python Script Example:
```python
import random
import string

def generate_random_url():
    domains = ['com', 'net', 'org', 'io', 'edu']  # You can extend this list
    tlds = random.choice(domains)
    name_length = random.randint(5, 10)  # URL length between 5-10 characters
    name = ''.join(random.choices(string.ascii_lowercase + string.digits, k=name_length))
    return f"http://www.{name}.{tlds}"

# Generate a few random URLs
num_urls = 5
for _ in range(num_urls):
    print(generate_random_url())
```

#### To run the script:
1. Save the script to a file, say `generate_urls.py`.
2. Run it using Python:
   ```bash
   python3 generate_urls.py
   ```
   This will generate 5 random URLs. You can adjust the `num_urls` value to generate more or fewer URLs.

### 2. **Use a Web-Based Random URL Generator**
If you prefer not to code, you can use online tools that generate random URLs. Some services provide random or non-existent URLs for testing:

- **Random URL Generator**: Websites like [https://www.randomlists.com/random-websites](https://www.randomlists.com/random-websites) can generate random URLs for testing purposes.

### 3. **Use Faker Library (Python)**
The Python **Faker** library is useful for generating all kinds of fake data, including random URLs, emails, addresses, etc. This could be particularly helpful if you need more structured random data.

#### Installing Faker:
```bash
sudo dnf install python3-pip
pip install faker
```

#### Example using Faker:
```python
from faker import Faker

fake = Faker()

# Generate 5 random URLs
for _ in range(5):
    print(fake.url())
```

### 4. **Use Bash + /dev/urandom**
You can use a simple Bash script with `/dev/urandom` to generate random characters for the URL:

#### Bash Script Example:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
for i in {1..5}; do
    domain=$(head /dev/urandom | tr -dc a-z0-9 | head -c 8)
    tld=$(echo -e "com\nnet\norg\nio\nedu" | shuf -n 1)
    echo "http://www.$domain.$tld"
done
```

#### To run the script:
1. Save it as `generate_urls.sh`.
2. Make it executable and run it:
   ```bash
   chmod +x generate_urls.sh
   ./generate_urls.sh
   ```

This will generate 5 random URLs, and you can adjust the range or parameters as needed.

### 5. **Online Random URL Services (for existing sites)**
If you want to test random existing websites rather than fake ones, you can use a service that provides lists of random real websites:

- **Random Website Button**: There are sites like [random-website.com](http://random-website.com/) or **StumbleUpon-like** tools that allow you to load random real websites. You can use this in combination with an automation tool to visit them programmatically.

### Summary:

- **Python Scripts**: Create random URLs easily using Python, either by manually coding it or using libraries like `Faker`.
- **Bash Scripting**: Use `/dev/urandom` in combination with simple Bash commands to create random URLs.
- **Online Tools**: Websites like **randomlists.com** provide existing URL generation for quick testing.
  
For generating many URLs or more complex test cases, the **Faker** library in Python is the most robust solution. Let me know if you need further assistance!
