# Prompt

The problem I have with installing packages on a per project basis is that I work with the same python packages in multiple projects. It seems very inefficient to have to reinstall the same thing over and over again in each repo. And it's also annoying to have to remember to do that!

# Output

I understand your concern about efficiency and the inconvenience of reinstalling the same packages for multiple projects. There are a few approaches you can consider to address this issue:

1. Shared Virtual Environment:
   You can create a shared virtual environment that contains all the common packages you use across projects. However, this approach can lead to version conflicts if different projects require different versions of the same package.

2. Package Caching:
   pip has a built-in caching mechanism. When you install a package, pip caches it locally. Subsequent installations of the same package version will use the cached version, speeding up the process. You can configure pip to use a shared cache directory:

   Create or edit `~/.config/pip/pip.conf` (on Unix) or `%APPDATA%\pip\pip.ini` (on Windows) and add:
   ```
   [global]
   cache-dir = /path/to/shared/cache
   ```

3. Requirements Files:
   Maintain a common `requirements.txt` file with your frequently used packages. You can then quickly install these in a new project:
   ```
   pip install -r /path/to/common/requirements.txt
   ```

4. Custom Base Images (for Docker):
   If you're using Docker, create a custom base image with your common packages pre-installed. Use this as the base for your project-specific Dockerfiles.

5. Poetry with Source Dependencies:
   If you're using Poetry, you can specify local directories as sources for packages. This allows you to maintain a single installation of a package and use it across multiple projects.

6. Conda Environments:
   Conda allows you to create environments that can be shared across projects. It also has efficient package management and caching mechanisms.

7. pyenv-virtualenv:
   This tool allows you to create virtual environments that can be shared across projects while still maintaining isolation.

8. Project Templates:
   Create project templates with your common setup (including a requirements.txt or pyproject.toml) that you can quickly clone or copy when starting a new project.

For managing packages without a full IDE, you can use:

1. Command Line Interface (CLI):
   Use pip directly from the terminal.

2. pipx:
   A tool for installing and running Python applications in isolated environments.

3. Poetry:
   Offers a CLI for dependency management and packaging.

4. pip-tools:
   A set of tools to help you keep your package dependencies up-to-date.

5. Conda:
   Provides a CLI for managing environments and packages.

Remember, while these solutions can save time and disk space, they come with trade-offs in terms of project isolation and reproducibility. The best approach depends on your specific workflow and requirements.
