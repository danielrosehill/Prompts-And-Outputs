# Prompt

I've thought about setting up a VPS just to run Python scripts. Let me ask you a question. It seems silly to set up a whole VPS just to run one individual script. Is it possible to set up a server for running a whole fleet of Pythons scripts? If so, is there any preferred distro or way of deploying the scripts onto the server if you want to edit and update them? How many Python scripts running occasionally could fit on a basic VPS?

# Output

Yes, it’s definitely possible to set up a VPS to run multiple Python scripts, and it’s a great way to maximize the use of your server. You can run a "fleet" of scripts that execute at different intervals or in parallel, depending on your needs. Here's how you can approach this:

### 1. **Choosing a VPS and Distro**
   - **VPS Providers**: Providers like **DigitalOcean**, **Linode**, **Vultr**, and **Hetzner** offer low-cost VPS plans. Even the cheapest tier (starting at $5/month) can handle a good number of lightweight Python scripts.
   - **Preferred Distro**: For Python script execution, the most common and reliable Linux distributions include:
     - **Ubuntu**: The most popular choice, with lots of documentation and support.
     - **Debian**: Stable, lightweight, and well-suited for servers.
     - **CentOS**: More stable and enterprise-focused, but Ubuntu/Debian are easier for most.
     - **Fedora**: Offers more up-to-date packages, but not as commonly used for production servers as Ubuntu or Debian.

   **Recommendation**: Start with **Ubuntu LTS** or **Debian**, which are easy to maintain, have great community support, and come with all the necessary Python tools.

### 2. **Managing Multiple Python Scripts**
   To run multiple Python scripts efficiently, here’s a setup that works well:

   - **Cron Jobs**: If your scripts are meant to run periodically (e.g., every few minutes or hours), you can use **cron jobs** to schedule them. This is lightweight and efficient.
     - Example: Add a cron job for each script by editing the crontab with `crontab -e` and scheduling them accordingly.

   - **Systemd Services**: For long-running scripts or daemons, you can create **systemd service files** that manage the lifecycle of each Python script, ensuring that they automatically restart if they crash, and can be controlled with `systemctl`.
     - Example: Create a service file in `/etc/systemd/system/your-script.service` to manage a specific script and use `systemctl` to start/stop it.

   - **Screen/Tmux**: For long-running or interactive scripts, you can run them in **screen** or **tmux** sessions, which allow you to detach from a running script and return to it later. This is especially useful for monitoring scripts or testing.
     - Example: Run `tmux` or `screen` to start a session and then execute your script inside.

   - **Task Queue System (Celery/RQ)**: If you want more sophisticated task management, you can use **Celery** or **Redis Queue (RQ)** to handle job scheduling, retries, and distributed execution. These systems are useful if you plan on scaling up and need more granular control over script execution.
     - Example: Celery can work with Redis or RabbitMQ to queue tasks and run multiple Python scripts asynchronously.

### 3. **Deploying and Updating Scripts**
   There are several ways to deploy and update your Python scripts on the server:

   - **SSH + Git**: One of the simplest and most effective ways is to use **Git** for version control. You can SSH into the server, pull updates from a Git repository, and update the scripts easily.
     - Example Workflow:
       1. Push updates to your GitHub/GitLab repo.
       2. SSH into your VPS and pull the updates using `git pull`.
       3. Restart the corresponding scripts if necessary (e.g., using `systemctl restart your-script.service`).

   - **SCP/RSYNC**: If you’re not using Git, you can use **SCP** or **rsync** to copy files from your local machine to the server.
     - Example: `scp -r your_script.py user@vps_ip:/path/to/scripts/`.

   - **Automatic Deployment**: For larger projects or when you want to automate deployment, you could set up **CI/CD pipelines** (e.g., using GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or GitLab CI) to automatically deploy the scripts whenever you push changes to your repository.

### 4. **Monitoring and Managing Resource Usage**
   Even on a basic VPS (e.g., 1 GB RAM, 1 vCPU), you can run a significant number of Python scripts, especially if they’re lightweight and run intermittently. Here’s how to estimate and manage capacity:

   - **Lightweight Scripts**: If the scripts are polling APIs, processing data, or sending alerts, you could likely run **dozens of scripts** simultaneously on a basic VPS.
     - For example, if each script uses 100 MB of RAM and minimal CPU, even a 1 GB RAM VPS could easily handle 8-10 scripts concurrently.

   - **Heavy Scripts**: If you’re doing more resource-intensive tasks (like ML models or web scraping), you’ll need to monitor resource usage more closely using tools like `htop` and `top`. 
     - Example: Use `htop` to see real-time CPU and memory usage. You can also monitor long-term performance using monitoring tools like **Netdata** or **Prometheus** to track CPU, RAM, and disk usage.

   - **Resource Management**: Use **nice** and **cpulimit** to limit CPU usage by specific scripts. If you want to prioritize certain scripts over others, these tools can ensure that resource-heavy tasks don’t consume all your VPS capacity.

### 5. **How Many Scripts Can You Run?**
   The number of Python scripts you can run on a basic VPS depends on:
   - **Script complexity**: Simple scripts that periodically check an API and send notifications are lightweight.
   - **Frequency**: Scripts running every few minutes or hours can easily be scheduled and won’t put much strain on the server.
   - **CPU and Memory Usage**: Monitoring resource usage with tools like `htop` helps. A 1 GB RAM, 1 vCPU VPS could handle 10-20 lightweight scripts running occasionally. For more demanding tasks, you’d need to monitor and perhaps upgrade to 2 GB RAM or 2 vCPUs for better performance.

### Conclusion:
- **Yes, you can definitely run a "fleet" of Python scripts on a VPS**, and it’s a very cost-effective approach compared to setting up individual environments.
- Use **Ubuntu** or **Debian** for the easiest management, and organize the scripts with **cron jobs, systemd services, or screen/tmux**.
- Deploying updates can be done via **SSH + Git**, or for more complex setups, a **CI/CD pipeline** for automatic deployments.
- A basic VPS should handle a decent number of lightweight scripts, especially with occasional polling, and scaling up is easy as your needs grow.

This approach should allow you to manage and update multiple scripts efficiently on a single VPS!
