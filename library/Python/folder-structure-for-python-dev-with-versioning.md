# Prompt

I'm working on a lot of GUI projects that I'm creating with the help of AI tools and using for my Fedora OS. I use github repos to manage all of them. I tend to require a lot of  iterations before I arrive at a finished product. However, I like to retain all of the versions as sometimes I want to roll back to an earlier iteration. Can you suggest a folder structure I can use for my project? Typically I'm working on single file Python GUIs

# Output

Based on your specific needs for managing GUI projects with multiple iterations, here's a suggested folder structure that can help you organize your work effectively:

## Project Structure

```
project-name/
├── src/
│   ├── main.py
│   ├── utils/
│   │   └── helper_functions.py
│   └── resources/
│       ├── images/
│       └── styles/
├── iterations/
│   ├── v1/
│   │   └── main_v1.py
│   ├── v2/
│   │   └── main_v2.py
│   └── v3/
│       └── main_v3.py
├── tests/
│   └── test_main.py
├── docs/
│   └── README.md
├── .gitignore
└── requirements.txt
```

## Explanation of the Structure

1. **src/** directory:
   - Contains the current working version of your GUI application.
   - `main.py` is your primary Python script for the GUI.
   - `utils/` folder can store any helper functions or classes.
   - `resources/` folder can store images, icons, or style sheets used in your GUI[1].

2. **iterations/** directory:
   - This is where you can store different versions of your GUI as you iterate.
   - Each version (`v1`, `v2`, etc.) contains a snapshot of your `main.py` at that stage[1].
   - This allows you to easily reference or roll back to previous versions without relying solely on Git history.

3. **tests/** directory:
   - Store your unit tests or integration tests here.

4. **docs/** directory:
   - Keep project documentation, including a README file with project details and usage instructions.

5. **.gitignore** file:
   - Specify files and directories that Git should ignore (e.g., `__pycache__`, `.pyc` files)[6].

6. **requirements.txt** file:
   - List all Python dependencies for your project[1].

## Best Practices for Your Workflow

1. **Version Control**: Use Git for version control. Make frequent, small commits with descriptive messages[2][5].

2. **Branching Strategy**: Consider using feature branches for significant changes or new features[2].

3. **Consistent Naming**: Use clear, consistent naming conventions for your files and folders[3].

4. **Documentation**: Keep your README.md up to date with project information, setup instructions, and usage guidelines[6].

5. **Iterative Development**: When you reach a significant milestone or want to preserve a particular version:
   - Copy your current `main.py` to the appropriate version folder in `iterations/`.
   - Update your working `main.py` in the `src/` directory as you continue development.

6. **Testing**: Write and update tests as you develop to ensure your GUI functions correctly[4].

7. **Dependency Management**: Keep your `requirements.txt` file updated whenever you add or remove dependencies[1].

By following this structure and these practices, you can maintain a clean, organized project that allows for easy version tracking and rollbacks while leveraging Git for overall version control. This approach combines the benefits of Git with a more granular, manual versioning system for your specific needs.
