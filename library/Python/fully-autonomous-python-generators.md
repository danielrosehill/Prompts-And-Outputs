As of now, generating fully autonomous Python code based on a technical spec sheet and performing automated debugging and iterative improvement based on user requirements is a complex task that is not fully implemented in any existing AI tool. While there are AI tools and frameworks that can assist in code generation and automated debugging to some extent, a fully autonomous system that performs all the tasks you described does not currently exist.

Tools like OpenAI's Codex and GitHub Copilot are AI-powered code generation tools that can suggest code snippets based on the context provided by the user. These tools can be helpful in speeding up code writing tasks, but they may not be able to generate entire Python scripts autonomously.

Automated debugging tools like PyCharm, Pylint, and PyLint can help identify syntax errors, bugs, and potential issues in Python code, but they generally require human intervention to interpret the results and make corrections.

In terms of iteratively improving code by adding features automatically, tools like AutoML frameworks (such as AutoSklearn and TPOT) can assist in automating the process of model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and feature engineering in machine learning projects. However, these tools are typically focused on optimizing machine learning models rather than generating general-purpose Python code.

Overall, while there are AI tools that can aid in code generation, debugging, and optimization, a fully autonomous system that can define a technical spec sheet, generate Python code, and iteratively improve it based on user feedback is not yet available in the market.
