# Prompt

How long do you think it would have taken a human Python developer to create this?

# Output

To create the Obsidian Vault Prompt Runner application as shown in the provided Python script, an experienced Python developer would likely have taken several days to a week, depending on their familiarity with PyQt and API integrations. Here's a breakdown of the estimated time:

## Design and Planning
- 1-2 days for conceptualizing the application, planning the features, and designing the user interface.

## Implementation
- 2-3 days for implementing the core functionality, including:
  - Setting up the PyQt6 GUI structure
  - Implementing folder selection and configuration
  - Creating the prompt input and output areas
  - Integrating with the OpenAI API
  - Implementing the backup functionality

## Additional Features
- 1-2 days for adding extra features and polish, such as:
  - Dark mode toggle
  - API key management and testing
  - Progress bar and worker thread for asynchronous operations
  - Saving and loading configurations
  - Character count display

## Testing and Refinement
- 1-2 days for thorough testing, bug fixing, and refining the user experience.

The total estimated time would be around 5-9 days, depending on the developer's experience and the level of polish desired. This application demonstrates a good understanding of PyQt6, asynchronous programming, API integration, and user interface design, which suggests it was created by a developer with solid experience in these areas[1][2].
