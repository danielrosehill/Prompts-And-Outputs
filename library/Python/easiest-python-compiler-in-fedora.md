# Prompt

Please recommend the easiest way to compile Python scripts into executable programs in Fedora Linux? i would ideally like to have a GUI for this purpose to make the process as easy as possible

# Output

Based on your requirements, I would recommend using auto-py-to-exe as the easiest way to compile Python scripts into executable programs on Fedora Linux, especially since you're looking for a GUI solution. Here's why it's a good choice:

1. Graphical User Interface: auto-py-to-exe provides a simple and intuitive GUI, making the process of converting Python scripts to executables very user-friendly[2][3].

2. Cross-platform compatibility: Although you're using Fedora Linux, auto-py-to-exe can create executables for Windows as well, which addresses your previous concern about creating .exe files without a Windows machine[2].

3. Easy installation: You can install auto-py-to-exe using pip, which is straightforward on Fedora Linux[3].

4. Based on PyInstaller: auto-py-to-exe is a frontend for PyInstaller, which is a well-established and reliable tool for creating executables from Python scripts[3].

To get started with auto-py-to-exe on Fedora Linux:

1. Open a terminal and install auto-py-to-exe using pip:
   ```
   pip install auto-py-to-exe
   ```

2. Once installed, you can launch the GUI by running:
   ```
   auto-py-to-exe
   ```

3. The GUI will open in your default web browser, where you can select your Python script, choose options, and convert it to an executable[3].

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to configure your build and create the executable.

auto-py-to-exe simplifies the process of creating executables and provides helpful options like choosing between one-file or one-directory output, adding icon files, and including additional files or folders in your executable[2][3].

If you encounter any issues or need more advanced features, you can always fall back to using PyInstaller directly from the command line, which auto-py-to-exe is based on[4].

Remember that while this method can create Windows executables on Linux, it's generally recommended to build on the target platform for the best compatibility. However, for simple scripts, cross-compiling from Linux to Windows should work fine in most cases.

# Input

But I can't run an exe in fedora! I want to compile it into something I can run on my computer!
