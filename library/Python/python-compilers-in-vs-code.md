One alternative to PyInstaller that provides a GUI for compiling Python scripts into executables on Fedora Linux is cx_Freeze. cx_Freeze is a tool that can create standalone executables from Python scripts, similar to PyInstaller.

You can install cx_Freeze on Fedora using the following command:

```bash
sudo dnf install python3-cx_Freeze
```

Once installed, you can use cx_Freeze via the command line or integrate it with your development environment. Unfortunately, cx_Freeze does not provide a built-in GUI tool like PyInstaller, but you can explore IDE plugins or external GUI tools to facilitate the process.

As you are using VS Code, you might consider configuring tasks in VS Code that run cx_Freeze commands to build your executables. This approach can streamline the compilation process and provide better integration with your workflow.

Feel free to explore cx_Freeze further and let me know if you need any assistance with integrating it into your development environment.
