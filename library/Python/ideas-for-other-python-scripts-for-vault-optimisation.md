# Prompt

Great. As you're familiar with my LLM output storage vault idea, can you think of any other Python scripts that might be useful to derive maximum utility for this tool and to optimise the vault ?

# Output

Here are some Python script ideas that could enhance the functionality and utility of your LLM output storage vault in Obsidian:

### 1. **Automatic Tagging and Categorization Script**
   - **Purpose**: This script could scan new markdown files in your vault and automatically assign tags or move them to specific folders based on the content.
   - **How it Works**:
     - Use natural language processing (NLP) techniques to identify key themes or topics within each markdown file.
     - Assign relevant tags or move files to specific folders like `Prompts`, `Outputs`, or any other category you have defined.
   - **Potential Libraries**: `spaCy`, `nltk`, or `transformers`.

### 2. **Content Summary Generator**
   - **Purpose**: Generate concise summaries for each markdown file, which can be stored as metadata or at the beginning of each file for quick reference.
   - **How it Works**:
     - Implement an NLP model to extract the most important sentences or generate a brief summary of each file's content.
     - Append the summary at the top of the file or store it in the file's metadata.
   - **Potential Libraries**: `transformers` (for using models like BERT or GPT), `sumy`.

### 3. **Cross-Reference Linker**
   - **Purpose**: Automatically detect related content across your markdown files and create cross-references between them.
   - **How it Works**:
     - Scan your vault for similar topics or related content using semantic similarity.
     - Insert markdown links to related files within each document.
   - **Potential Libraries**: `gensim` (for similarity measures), `scikit-learn`.

### 4. **Duplicate Content Finder**
   - **Purpose**: Identify and highlight duplicate or near-duplicate content in your vault, which could clutter your repository or make it harder to find unique insights.
   - **How it Works**:
     - Use text similarity measures to scan for duplicates.
     - Flag or list duplicate files, offering the option to merge, delete, or review them.
   - **Potential Libraries**: `difflib`, `fuzzywuzzy`.

### 5. **Markdown Linter and Formatter**
   - **Purpose**: Ensure all markdown files follow a consistent style and format for easier readability and maintenance.
   - **How it Works**:
     - Implement a linter that checks for common markdown issues (e.g., inconsistent heading levels, missing alt text in images, etc.).
     - Automatically format files according to predefined style rules.
   - **Potential Libraries**: `pymarkdownlint`, `markdown-it-py`.

### 6. **Search and Indexing Tool**
   - **Purpose**: Create a search index for all the content in your vault, enabling fast and efficient searching across all markdown files.
   - **How it Works**:
     - Index the content of all markdown files.
     - Implement a search function that allows you to query your vault with complex search terms, potentially using fuzzy matching.
   - **Potential Libraries**: `Whoosh`, `ElasticSearch` (if you want to scale up).

### 7. **Daily/Weekly Digest Creator**
   - **Purpose**: Automatically generate a digest of new content added to the vault within the last day or week.
   - **How it Works**:
     - Track the creation dates of markdown files.
     - Summarize new content and compile it into a single markdown file, perhaps in a "Digests" folder.
   - **Potential Libraries**: Python's built-in `datetime` module.

### 8. **Content Visualization Script**
   - **Purpose**: Generate visualizations that represent the relationships, frequency of topics, or growth of content within your vault.
   - **How it Works**:
     - Create graphs that show connections between related files (e.g., content linked by common tags or themes).
     - Plot the growth of content over time, visualizing metrics like file count, word count, or topics.
   - **Potential Libraries**: `matplotlib`, `networkx`, `seaborn`.

### 9. **Backup and Sync Utility**
   - **Purpose**: Regularly back up your vault to a cloud service or external drive and ensure synchronization across devices.
   - **How it Works**:
     - Automate the backup process, including versioning to keep track of changes.
     - Sync the vault between different locations (local, cloud, external) to ensure you always have the latest version.
   - **Potential Libraries**: `shutil`, `boto3` (for AWS S3), `google-cloud-storage`.

### 10. **Automated Metadata Extractor**
   - **Purpose**: Extract and store metadata (e.g., creation date, last modified date, word count) for each markdown file.
   - **How it Works**:
     - Scan all markdown files and extract relevant metadata.
     - Store this metadata in a centralized file or in the file's front matter for easy access and searching.
   - **Potential Libraries**: Python's `os` and `datetime` modules.

### 11. **Content Quality Analyzer**
   - **Purpose**: Analyze the quality of content within your vault, checking for things like readability, sentiment, or writing style consistency.
   - **How it Works**:
     - Use NLP tools to assess the readability score, sentiment analysis, and style consistency across your files.
     - Provide suggestions for improving content quality based on the analysis.
   - **Potential Libraries**: `textblob`, `readability`, `sentiment-analysis`.

### Conclusion
These scripts can significantly enhance the functionality of your LLM output storage vault in Obsidian, helping you maintain organization, improve content quality, and derive actionable insights from your stored data. Depending on your priorities, you could start with one or two of these scripts and gradually implement more as needed.## Extracted Prompts
