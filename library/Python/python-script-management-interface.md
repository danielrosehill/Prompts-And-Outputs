# Prompt
I'm building up quite a collection of python scripts for administering various aspects of the tools that I'm building. Let's imagine that I end up with a collection of perhaps 50 scripts on my computer. I'm trying to find a better system for using them than navigating around my scripts folder in the terminal. I've thought about building a GUI for running my scripts, but as the collection changes somewhat frequently, it seems like an inefficient approach, as I'll need to keep updating it. Can you think of a better solution? Ideally I'd like an admin tool for organising my script library and manually running scripts by clicking.

A more flexible and scalable solution might be to create a command-line interface (CLI) tool that serves as a launcher for your scripts. Here's an outline of how this could work:

1. **Script Registry**: Create a JSON or YAML file that acts as a registry for your scripts. This file would contain metadata about each script, such as the script's name, description, file path, and any parameters it might require.

2. **CLI Launcher**: Develop a Python script that reads from this registry and presents you with a menu of available scripts. You can navigate the menu using arrow keys or search by script name. When you select a script, the launcher would execute it.

3. **Dynamic Updates**: Since the registry is just a simple data file, you can easily add or remove scripts by updating the JSON/YAML file. The CLI tool would automatically reflect these changes without needing to modify the code.

4. **Optional GUI**: If you eventually want a graphical interface, you could use a tool like `Tkinter` or `PyQt` to build a simple GUI that reads from the same registry file. This would allow you to click and run scripts, but the underlying system remains flexible and easy to update.

5. **Integration with Task Schedulers**: If you want to automate some scripts, you could integrate your CLI tool with cron jobs (on Linux) or Task Scheduler (on Windows), making it a one-stop solution for managing and running your scripts.

This approach would give you the flexibility of a dynamic system while still providing a structured way to manage and execute your scripts.## Extracted Prompts
