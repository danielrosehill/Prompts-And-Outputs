The information provided is for demonstrative purposes only and is intended to highlight constraints and capabilities in LLM applications and prompt engineering strategies.*


# Prompt

I'm looking for the most powerful LLM available for generating python scripts from natural language descriptions. I would like to be able to provide detailed descriptions of the intended functionalities and have the LLM generate code that works perfectly. My configurations are long and detailed and the outputs are long code blocks. So I'd need an LLM with a tokenisation window that would allow this. Ideally I'd like an LLM that was fine tuned on turning out compliant code. I'd be happy to use this via an API. What are my best options?

# Output


Based on your requirements for a powerful LLM specialized in generating Python code from detailed natural language descriptions, here are some of the best options available:

## GPT-4

GPT-4 is currently one of the most advanced and capable language models for code generation[1]. It excels at understanding complex prompts and generating accurate, functional code across multiple programming languages, including Python. Key advantages include:

- Large context window (up to 32,000 tokens)
- Excellent comprehension of detailed instructions
- Ability to generate long, complex code blocks
- Fine-tuned for code generation tasks
- Available via OpenAI's API

GPT-4 would be an excellent choice for your needs, given its ability to handle long, detailed prompts and generate compliant code based on complex specifications.

## Code Llama 70B

Code Llama 70B is a powerful open-source model specifically designed for code generation tasks[4]. Its key features include:

- 70 billion parameters, making it one of the largest open models available
- Specialized training on programming tasks
- Support for multiple programming languages, with strong Python capabilities
- Available via API through services like Replicate

Code Llama 70B offers performance comparable to proprietary models and could be an excellent option if you prefer an open-source solution.

## OpenAI Codex

OpenAI Codex, the model powering GitHub Copilot, is specifically designed for code generation tasks[7]. Its advantages include:

- Trained on billions of lines of source code
- Highly proficient in Python
- Larger context window for Python code (14KB) compared to GPT-3
- Ability to interpret natural language commands and execute them
- Available through OpenAI's API

Codex's specialization in code generation and its focus on Python make it a strong contender for your needs.

## StarCoder

StarCoder is another powerful option for code generation[5]. Its features include:

- Trained on over 80 programming languages, including Python
- Large context length of over 8,000 tokens
- Ability to generate code from natural language descriptions
- Open-source model, allowing for customization

StarCoder's large context window and specialization in code tasks make it a suitable choice for your requirements.

## Recommendation

Given your specific needs for detailed prompts, long code outputs, and a focus on Python, GPT-4 or OpenAI Codex would likely be your best options. Both offer large context windows, excellent understanding of complex instructions, and are fine-tuned for code generation tasks. They're also readily available through APIs, making integration into your workflow straightforward.

If you prefer an open-source solution, Code Llama 70B or StarCoder could be excellent alternatives, offering comparable performance and specialization in code generation tasks.

Ultimately, the choice may depend on factors such as specific performance on your use cases, pricing, and integration requirements. It might be worth testing a few of these options to see which performs best for your particular needs.
