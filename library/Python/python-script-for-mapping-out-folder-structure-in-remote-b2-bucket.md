# Prompt

can you write a python script which would connect to a b2 bucket and provide a report on the file structure? All it would need to do is map out the file structure to 3 levels of recursion and print that to a txt document

# Output

It looks like there was an incomplete script in the previous message. I'll complete it and ensure it can connect to a Backblaze B2 bucket and generate a report of the file structure up to 3 levels. Hereâ€™s the updated script:

```python
import b2sdk.v2 as b2
import os

# Replace these credentials with your actual B2 credentials
B2_APPLICATION_KEY_ID = 'your_application_key_id'
B2_APPLICATION_KEY = 'your_application_key'
BUCKET_NAME = 'your_bucket_name'
OUTPUT_FILE = 'b2_file_structure_report.txt'

# Connect to B2 bucket
def connect_to_b2(application_key_id, application_key):
    info = b2.InMemoryAccountInfo()
    b2_api = b2.B2Api(info)
    b2_api.authorize_account("production", application_key_id, application_key)
    return b2_api

# Get file structure of the bucket
def get_file_structure(bucket, folder_prefix='', level=1, max_levels=3):
    if level > max_levels:
        return []

    file_structure = []
    for file_version, folder_name in bucket.ls(folder_prefix):
        # Only list latest versions of files
        if file_version.action == 'upload':
            file_structure.append((folder_prefix, file_version.file_name))

            # If this is a folder, recursively list files in it
            if folder_name.endswith('/'):
                sub_files = get_file_structure(bucket, folder_prefix=folder_name, level=level + 1, max_levels=max_levels)
                file_structure.extend(sub_files)

    return file_structure

# Write the file structure to a txt file
def write_file_structure_to_txt(file_structure, output_file):
    with open(output_file, 'w') as f:
        for folder_prefix, file_name in file_structure:
            indent = '    ' * (folder_prefix.count('/') - 1)
            f.write(f"{indent}{file_name}\n")

# Main function to connect, retrieve file structure, and write to a file
def main():
    b2_api = connect_to_b2(B2_APPLICATION_KEY_ID, B2_APPLICATION_KEY)
    bucket = b2_api.get_bucket_by_name(BUCKET_NAME)

    file_structure = get_file_structure(bucket)
    write_file_structure_to_txt(file_structure, OUTPUT_FILE)

    print(f"File structure has been written to {OUTPUT_FILE}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Key Elements of the Script:
1. **B2 Credentials**: Replace `your_application_key_id`, `your_application_key`, and `your_bucket_name` with your actual Backblaze B2 credentials.
2. **Connection to B2**: The script connects to the B2 cloud storage using `b2sdk.v2`.
3. **Recursion**: The function `get_file_structure` recursively lists files up to 3 levels deep.
4. **Output File**: The final structure is saved to `b2_file_structure_report.txt`.

### Requirements:
- You need to install the B2 SDK for Python. You can do this by running:
  ```sh
  pip install b2sdk
  ```

This script will generate a simple report of the file structure, making it easy for you to navigate through the B2 bucket's organization up to 3 levels deep. Let me know if you need further modifications!
