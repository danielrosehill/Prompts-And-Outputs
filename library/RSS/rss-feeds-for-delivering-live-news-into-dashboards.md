# Prompt

Are RSS feeds still used for the purpose of ingesting news feeds into monitoring dashboards? Or are API integrations now more used for this purpose?

# Output

Based on the information provided in the search results and the context of your question, here's a summary of the current state of RSS feeds vs. API integrations for ingesting news feeds into monitoring dashboards:

1. RSS feeds are still used, but their role has evolved:
- RSS remains relevant for content distribution and aggregation.
- Many popular content curation sites like Feedly and Flipboard still rely heavily on RSS.
- RSS offers simplicity, accessibility, and user control over information sources.

2. APIs have become more prevalent for real-time data:
- APIs provide more dynamic and customizable data retrieval compared to RSS.
- They allow for more specific queries and real-time information.
- APIs can offer richer metadata and more structured data formats (e.g., JSON).

3. Advantages of RSS for monitoring dashboards:
- Simplicity and wide support across many news sources.
- Lower impact on API rate limits (RSS feeds often don't count against API quotas).
- Good for periodic updates and less time-sensitive information.

4. Advantages of APIs for monitoring dashboards:
- More real-time and on-demand data retrieval.
- Greater flexibility in querying specific information.
- Often provide more comprehensive metadata and filtering options.

5. Hybrid approaches:
- Some services offer both RSS feeds and APIs, allowing users to choose the most appropriate method for their needs.
- Some modern tools can work with both RSS and APIs, providing flexibility in data ingestion methods.

6. Considerations for choosing between RSS and API:
- Update frequency requirements (real-time vs. periodic)
- Specificity of data needed (broad updates vs. targeted queries)
- Resource constraints (API rate limits vs. RSS simplicity)
- Integration complexity (APIs may require more development work)

In conclusion, while APIs have become more prevalent for real-time and highly specific data needs, RSS feeds are still used and remain relevant for many monitoring dashboard applications, especially where simplicity and broad content aggregation are priorities. The choice between RSS and API often depends on the specific requirements of the monitoring dashboard and the capabilities of the news sources being integrated.
