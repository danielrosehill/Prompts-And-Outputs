There isn't a precise or widely accepted figure for how many **RSS feeds** are in existence globally, but estimates suggest that the number could range in the millions. Here are some factors and insights that help estimate the total number of RSS feeds:

1. **RSS is decentralized**: Unlike centralized platforms, RSS feeds are generated by countless individual websites, blogs, media outlets, academic journals, and more. Each website that offers syndicated content via RSS can have multiple feeds (e.g., per section, author, or category), contributing to the large number.

2. **RSS directories**: Directories like **Feedly** and **Inoreader** index millions of feeds. Feedly, for instance, has claimed to track over **40 million** sources at one point, though not all of these are necessarily still active.

3. **Large-scale web platforms**: Many blogging platforms (like WordPress) and content management systems (CMS) offer automatic RSS feeds. WordPress alone powers **43% of the web**, and many of those sites generate multiple RSS feeds for different categories, tags, or authors.

4. **Inactive but existing feeds**: Many RSS feeds, even if inactive or no longer updated, continue to exist. This includes older blogs, defunct websites, or discontinued media outlets.

In short, there could be **millions** of RSS feeds worldwide, especially when considering both active and inactive feeds. However, because RSS is a decentralized protocol, it's impossible to determine an exact figure.
