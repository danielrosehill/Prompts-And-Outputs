Yes, there are several methods and tools that can help you determine if a website has an RSS feed and provide the feed URL if it exists:

### **1. Browser Extensions**
- **RSS Feed Reader** (Chrome/Firefox): 
  - This extension automatically detects RSS feeds on the page you visit. It will notify you if there are feeds available and give you the option to subscribe or view the RSS feed URL.
- **Feedbro**: 
  - Available for both Chrome and Firefox, Feedbro detects RSS/Atom feeds on the page you're currently viewing and displays them, allowing you to copy the link or subscribe directly.

### **2. Online Tools**
- **RSS.app**: 
  - You can enter a URL, and it will check whether an RSS feed exists for that page. If no RSS feed is found, it sometimes can generate a custom feed for the content on that site.
  - Website: [https://rss.app](https://rss.app)
  
- **FetchRSS**:
  - FetchRSS allows you to enter the URL of a page and discover any available RSS feeds. If a feed does not exist, you can also create one manually.
  - Website: [https://fetchrss.com](https://fetchrss.com)

- **FiveFilters Feed Creator**:
  - This tool allows you to enter a URL, and it will attempt to create an RSS feed from pages that don’t natively have one.
  - Website: [https://createfeed.fivefilters.org/](https://createfeed.fivefilters.org/)

### **3. Manual Check Methods**
- **View Page Source**:
  - Go to the website, right-click anywhere on the page, and select "View Page Source" (or press `Ctrl+U`). Look for common RSS link tags, such as:
    ```html
    <link rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml" title="RSS" href="URL_TO_RSS_FEED" />
    ```
  - You can also use the `Find` (`Ctrl+F`) function to search for "RSS" or "feed" in the HTML source code.

- **Common RSS URLs**:
  - Many websites use predictable URLs for RSS feeds. Try appending `/feed`, `/rss`, `/atom`, or similar to the base URL:
    - `https://example.com/feed`
    - `https://example.com/rss`
    - `https://example.com/blog/feed`

### **4. Command-Line Tool**
- **curl and grep**:
  - You can use command-line tools like `curl` and `grep` to look for RSS feeds:
    ```bash
    curl -s https://example.com | grep -i "application/rss+xml"
    ```
  - This command will download the HTML of the page and search for references to RSS feeds.

### **5. Website Crawlers and Custom Scripts**
- **Python Script with BeautifulSoup**:
  - You can use Python to scrape the HTML of a given website and detect RSS links. Here's a simple script to do this:
    ```python
    import requests
    from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

    def find_rss_feed(url):
        try:
            response = requests.get(url)
            soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')
            feed_links = soup.findAll('link', type='application/rss+xml')
            feeds = [link['href'] for link in feed_links if link.has_attr('href')]
            return feeds if feeds else "No RSS feeds found"
        except Exception as e:
            return f"An error occurred: {e}"

    # Example usage
    url = "https://example.com"
    print(find_rss_feed(url))
    ```
  - This script sends an HTTP request to the provided URL, parses the HTML using `BeautifulSoup`, and looks for `<link>` tags with an RSS type.

### **6. RSS Aggregators with Feed Detection**
- **Inoreader** or **Feedly**:
  - These feed aggregators automatically detect RSS feeds when you enter a website URL. If you add a URL that doesn’t have an obvious feed, they may suggest possible feeds.

### **Summary**:
- **Browser extensions** like **RSS Feed Reader** are probably the easiest solution for frequent use.
- **Online tools** such as **RSS.app** or **FetchRSS** are great if you want a straightforward web interface to find feeds.
- If you're comfortable with more technical approaches, using **curl** or writing a simple **Python script** could also work well for checking feeds systematically.
