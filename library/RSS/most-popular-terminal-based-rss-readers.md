# Prompt

Which terminal based RSS readers are the most popular across platforms? Do any support multi pane / grid layout views?

# Output

Here’s a breakdown of the **most popular terminal-based RSS readers** that work across platforms and the layout features they offer, particularly focusing on multi-pane or grid layouts:

### 1. **Newsboat**
   - **Popularity**: Probably the most popular terminal-based RSS reader, especially among Linux users.
   - **Platform Support**: Primarily Linux and macOS, though it can be compiled on Windows with Cygwin or WSL.
   - **Multi-Pane/Grid Layout**: 
     - **No native multi-pane layout**. Newsboat has a single-column layout by default: the feed list, followed by article headlines, followed by the content view.
     - You can simulate some form of multitasking by splitting your terminal (e.g., using **tmux** or **tiling window managers**) to have multiple Newsboat instances open in different panes.
   - **Customization**: Highly configurable, but no multi-pane/grid layout support out-of-the-box.

### 2. **Canto**
   - **Popularity**: Popular for its minimalist approach and focus on speed and simplicity.
   - **Platform Support**: Linux, macOS, and other Unix-like systems.
   - **Multi-Pane/Grid Layout**:
     - **No native multi-pane layout**.
     - Canto displays a list of articles in a single-column layout, and when you select an article, the content is shown in the same window. However, Canto is designed to be **lightweight and fast** and works well in combination with tools like **tmux**.
   - **Special Features**: Supports **auto-fetching** and is very customizable via configuration files.

### 3. **sfeed**
   - **Popularity**: Favored by users who prefer minimalist, scriptable, and lightweight solutions.
   - **Platform Support**: Linux and other Unix-based systems.
   - **Multi-Pane/Grid Layout**:
     - **No native multi-pane layout**.
     - sfeed is a collection of shell scripts designed to process and display RSS feeds in a terminal. It is very minimal and uses **one-column views** without multi-pane support. However, sfeed can be integrated with other terminal tools like **tmux** for more flexibility.
   - **Customization**: Extremely flexible for advanced users who want to integrate with custom scripts.

### 4. **Elfeed (in Emacs)**
   - **Popularity**: Very popular among **Emacs** users, especially for those who prefer having everything within a single interface.
   - **Platform Support**: Linux, macOS, Windows (via Emacs).
   - **Multi-Pane/Grid Layout**:
     - **Yes**. Elfeed, when used within Emacs, supports multi-pane and grid layouts. You can open multiple **windows** (panes) for different parts of Elfeed, such as a feed list on one pane, the article list on another, and the article view in a third pane.
   - **Customization**: Hugely customizable, leveraging Emacs' ability to create custom window setups and layouts.

### 5. **RSSTail**
   - **Popularity**: Popular for users who want a super-lightweight solution that simply displays RSS feeds in real time.
   - **Platform Support**: Linux and Unix-based systems.
   - **Multi-Pane/Grid Layout**:
     - **No native multi-pane layout**.
     - RSSTail is a simple tool that shows RSS updates in real time, much like a tail command. It does not support multi-pane layouts or complex navigation.
   - **Special Features**: Great for minimalists who want feeds displayed like a stream in the terminal.

### 6. **TICKR**
   - **Popularity**: Known for its scrolling ticker-like behavior.
   - **Platform Support**: Linux, macOS, and other Unix-based systems.
   - **Multi-Pane/Grid Layout**:
     - **No native multi-pane layout**, but its use case is different. TICKR scrolls through headlines in a ticker format, so it's less focused on traditional RSS browsing and more on a continuous feed of news.
   - **Special Features**: Continuous scrolling display of headlines in your terminal.

### Multi-Pane Layout Alternatives

While most terminal-based RSS readers don’t natively support **multi-pane** or **grid layouts**, you can simulate this functionality using terminal multiplexer tools like:

- **tmux**: Allows you to split your terminal into multiple panes, each running a different instance of a program like **Newsboat**, or showing a different feed or view. This can simulate a multi-pane layout.
- **Tiling window managers** (e.g., **i3**, **awesome**): These allow you to divide your screen into multiple windows, where you could have one window for feeds, another for reading articles, and even more panes for other tasks.

### Summary of Multi-Pane Capabilities:
- **Elfeed (Emacs)**: Supports multi-pane layouts natively within Emacs and is highly customizable.
- **Newsboat**: No native multi-pane support, but you can simulate this with tools like tmux.
- **Canto, sfeed, RSSTail, TICKR**: No multi-pane layouts, but they are lightweight, minimalist tools that can be enhanced with terminal multiplexers.

For users who want the flexibility of a **multi-pane** or **grid layout**, **Elfeed within Emacs** is the best option. For others, using a terminal multiplexer like **tmux** with tools like **Newsboat** can simulate a more dynamic and productive workflow.
