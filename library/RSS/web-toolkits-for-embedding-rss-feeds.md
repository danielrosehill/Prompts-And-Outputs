# Input

could you please provide a list of tools that allow you to create website widgets from rss feeds and which are free? or perhaps there are even python libraries that can achieve the same objective?

# Output
Based on the search results and my knowledge, here are some tools and Python libraries that allow you to create website widgets from RSS feeds, with a focus on free options:

Free Tools:

1. RSS.app - Offers a free plan to generate RSS feeds and create embeddable widgets for websites.

2. Tagembed - Provides a free RSS widget for websites to collect, organize, and embed RSS feeds.

3. Elfsight - Has a free plan for their RSS Feed widget that can be customized and embedded on websites.

4. Common Ninja - Offers a free RSS Feed widget that can be easily added to websites.

5. AGR Technology RSS Feed Widget - A free tool to insert RSS feeds into websites.

Python Libraries:

1. feedparser - A popular Python library for parsing RSS and Atom feeds. While it doesn't create widgets directly, it can be used to build custom RSS feed displays.

2. rfeed - An extensible RSS 2.0 feed generator written in Python. It can be used to create RSS feeds programmatically.

3. Flask-FeedGenerator - A Flask extension for generating RSS/Atom feeds. This could be used to create a simple web app that serves RSS content.

4. django-feed-generator - A Django app for generating RSS feeds. Similar to Flask-FeedGenerator, it can be used to create web applications that serve RSS content.

5. PyRSS2Gen - A Python library for generating RSS 2.0 feeds. It can be used to create RSS feeds that could then be displayed on a website.

While the Python libraries don't create widgets directly, they can be used in combination with web frameworks like Flask or Django to create custom RSS feed displays or widgets for websites. The free tools, on the other hand, offer more ready-to-use widget solutions that can be easily embedded into websites without requiring programming knowledge.
