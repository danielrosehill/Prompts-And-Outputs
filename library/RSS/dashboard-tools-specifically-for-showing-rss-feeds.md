If you're looking for dashboard tools specifically designed to display RSS feeds in custom configurations, here are a couple of excellent options to consider:

1. **Feeder**
   - Feeder allows you to create a customizable dashboard that can track and manage multiple RSS feeds live. You can set up to 10 columns or decks for specific feeds, folders, or types of feeds, making it easy to organize your information. It offers real-time updates, so you can see new posts as they come in, which is great for staying informed without needing to refresh constantly. More information can be found at [Feeder](https://feeder.co/product/dashboard)【215†source】.

2. **FeedDeck**
   - FeedDeck is an open-source RSS and social media feed reader inspired by TweetDeck. It enables you to follow your favorite feeds in a deck layout, allowing for a clear and organized display of information. FeedDeck supports a variety of sources, including RSS feeds, GitHub notifications, and YouTube channels, providing a versatile solution for tracking content across different platforms. You can explore its features further at [FeedDeck](https://feeddeck.app/)【216†source】.

Both of these tools are user-friendly and allow for significant customization, enabling you to create a tailored experience for monitoring your RSS feeds. They can help you consolidate information in a manageable way, making it easier to keep track of updates that matter to you.
