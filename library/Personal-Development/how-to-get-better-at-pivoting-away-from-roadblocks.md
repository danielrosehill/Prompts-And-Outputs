# Prompt

I'm beginning to realise something about myself: when I get stuck, I wait way too long to ask for help. You're making it so much easier! My philosophy is this: when something is proving unreasonably difficult (like getting this formatting to work in Zapier) .... give up and try something else. Can you encourage me to be a bit more decisive in making these pivots? How can I realise that it's not a bad thing to change course when I hit roadbumps? This makes these projects so stressful for me and I end up wasting so much time trying to get over little obstacles. I know I need to find a better way!

It sounds like you're having an important realization, and that’s a powerful first step toward positive change! Here’s something to keep in mind: **changing course when you're hitting roadblocks isn't giving up; it's a strategic move**. Let’s reframe this together.

Consider this analogy: imagine you’re hiking, and suddenly, the path is blocked by a massive boulder. One option is to spend hours trying to move it out of the way—feeling exhausted and stuck. The other is to look around for an alternate route. That doesn’t mean you're giving up on reaching your destination; you're just taking a smarter path to get there. Pivoting is **adaptive** and makes you a more effective problem solver.

Here's how you can practice being more decisive about these pivots:

1. **Set a Time Limit for Roadblocks**: Give yourself a set amount of time—say 30 minutes—to solve a problem. If you don't make significant progress in that time, **pause and reconsider your approach**. This helps you actively decide to change course rather than feeling like you’re reluctantly giving up after hours of frustration.

2. **Normalize Asking for Help**: Recognize that asking for help or switching tools isn’t a sign of weakness, it’s a skill. When you ask for help earlier, you actually show **self-awareness and efficiency**. Remind yourself that every expert or skilled professional does this, often more than you'd think.

3. **Focus on Your Energy, Not Just the Task**: If a task is draining you, it might be a sign to move on or try something else. Energy is a precious resource, and maintaining momentum often leads to better results. When you find yourself losing energy, take that as a cue that it might be time to change directions.

4. **Celebrate Your Pivots**: Every time you choose to move on from something that isn't working, **acknowledge the decision as progress**. It's like cleaning up mental clutter—each pivot frees you to work on what’s most effective and fulfilling. It might help to even jot it down: "Today, I pivoted to make things work better." This helps you see pivots as victories, not defeats.

5. **Visualize Future Success, Not Stagnation**: Imagine what it feels like to keep making steady progress toward your goals without the weight of endless little obstacles. Every time you make the choice to change tools or approaches, you're stepping toward that lighter, more productive future. The faster you adapt, the quicker you reach that point where things feel easier, not harder.

You have great instincts about what's working and what isn’t, and you're already moving in the right direction by recognizing this pattern. The next step is to **give yourself permission** to change course early. If something is proving unreasonably difficult, remember: there’s nothing noble about struggling through it if there’s a better option available. Real progress doesn’t always come from brute force; it often comes from making smart, strategic decisions.

You've got this, and I'm here whenever you need help finding those new paths. Let's make sure every roadblock is an opportunity to discover something better.
