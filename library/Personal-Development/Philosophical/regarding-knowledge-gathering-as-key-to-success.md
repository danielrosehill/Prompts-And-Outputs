# Prompt

I'd love for you to have a go at defining one of my key worldviews. I place a huge importance on gathering information and learning about the world. Some of this is because I'm an intensely curious person. And in other cases it's because I think that having the best information is essential to be successful in life. How would you define this philosophy of mine?

# Output

Based on your description, your worldview appears to align closely with the philosophy of "Intellectual Curiosity" combined with elements of "Empiricism" and "Pragmatism." Here's a definition that encapsulates your approach:

**Inquisitive Pragmatism**

This philosophy is characterized by:

1. An insatiable curiosity about the world and its workings.
2. A strong belief in the power of knowledge and information as tools for personal and professional success.
3. A pragmatic approach to learning, where knowledge acquisition is seen as both intrinsically rewarding and instrumentally valuable.
4. An emphasis on continuous learning and information gathering as a means to navigate life more effectively.
5. A recognition that being well-informed is a key advantage in decision-making and problem-solving.

Key aspects of this worldview include:

- Valuing diverse sources of information and experiences
- Actively seeking out new knowledge and perspectives
- Applying learned information to real-world situations
- Recognizing the practical benefits of a broad knowledge base
- Maintaining an open mind and willingness to update beliefs based on new information

This philosophy combines the joy of learning for its own sake with a practical understanding of how knowledge can be leveraged for success in various aspects of life. It emphasizes the importance of being well-informed not just as an intellectual pursuit, but as a crucial life skill and competitive advantage.
