A worldview that places immense value on conducting research and acquiring knowledge to understand the world is often described as epistemophilic or driven by a rationalist and empiricist mindset. It emphasizes the belief that knowledge is the foundation for progress, problem-solving, and making sense of reality. This worldview holds that through systematic inquiry, observation, and reasoning, one can uncover truths about the universe, human behavior, and societal systems. It also champions the idea that knowledge should be continuously sought, questioned, and updated as new discoveries emerge, and it considers intellectual curiosity and critical thinking as essential virtues for personal growth and societal advancement.
