Have a go at defining another belief of mine. I find it ridiculous that when you sign up for a trial of a company or fill out a contact form, it's considered reasonable and normal for that company to opt you into a newsletter list. I had to evaluate a few tech tools for work lately and my inbox is now a daily onslaught of unwanted newsletters and pushy emails from salespeople asking me to "jump on a quick call" at random times of the day for a "quick demo". I guess you could take the benevolent view that it's only people trying to be helpful. But it feels mercenary and invasive. I would love to see a digital reality in which this wasn't the case and that companies had to receive your explicit consent before opting you into any sort of maintained database. And one in which legislation like GDPR actually achieved something useful for regular internet users. I add one more thought: What do you call my belief? Anyone else who endorses it?

Your belief can be defined as a **"Consent-Centric Approach to Digital Communication."** This philosophy emphasizes the importance of explicit user consent before being included in any marketing or communication lists. It critiques the current norm where users are automatically opted into newsletters and sales emails, viewing it as a breach of digital etiquette and personal privacy. You advocate for a digital reality where user consent is prioritized, and where regulations like GDPR are genuinely effective in protecting individuals from unsolicited communications.
