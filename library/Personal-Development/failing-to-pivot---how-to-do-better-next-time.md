# Prompt

Let's take this case. How long do you think I should have tried attempting to get this stage of the automation to work (converting the JSON from the API into markdown to put into GPT). I must have spent an hour and I've given up in frustration. That seems like a waste of time, no? Tell me what to do differnently next time!

# Output

It sounds like you’ve put a lot of effort into this particular stage, and it’s completely understandable to feel frustrated. Spending an hour trying to solve something without progress can definitely feel like a waste of time, and it signals that it might be time to adjust your approach earlier. Here's what you could do differently next time:

### 1. **Implement a Time Limit Rule**
   - **Set a Time Limit (30-45 Minutes)**: When you encounter a problem like this, set a timer for 30 to 45 minutes. If you’re not making significant headway by then, it’s a sign to either ask for help, take a break, or consider a different tool or approach.
   - This lets you make progress without getting bogged down and prevents frustration from setting in. Next time, if 30 minutes pass without a breakthrough, you’ll have a prompt to take a step back.

### 2. **Adopt a “Three-Step Pivot” Approach**
   - **Step 1**: **Search for Similar Solutions** – Spend a short, focused session (5-10 minutes) researching whether anyone else has solved a similar issue with the tool you’re using (e.g., Zapier).
   - **Step 2**: **Ask for Help** – Tap into forums, communities (e.g., Reddit, Stack Overflow, Zapier forums), or ask someone in your network. Often, someone else’s insight can get you unstuck in just a few minutes.
   - **Step 3**: **Decide on a Change of Course** – If neither research nor reaching out brings you closer to a solution, it’s time to pivot. Find an alternative approach, such as a different tool or a simpler way to achieve your goal.

### 3. **Recognize the “Frustration Threshold” Early**
   - If you notice yourself getting frustrated—your energy drops, you feel irritable, or you’re tempted to “just make it work” out of sheer determination—**pause**. This is your brain’s signal that you’re not making effective progress.
   - When you notice frustration setting in, give yourself **permission to move on**. Switching gears when frustration kicks in isn’t a failure; it’s a sign of good decision-making. Use that moment to step back and consider your options.

### 4. **Leverage Simpler Alternatives**
   - If something like formatting JSON is proving challenging, think about whether there’s a **simpler way** to achieve a similar outcome. Instead of spending more time trying to get it perfect in Zapier, you could:
     - Use another tool that is easier for that specific task (e.g., Make, Pipedream).
     - Extract the core information in a simpler way first (maybe just parts of the JSON) and build on that.
   - Start with a “good enough” solution rather than a perfect one, and iterate from there.

### 5. **Celebrate the Early Pivot**
   - Whenever you decide to stop spending time on an approach that’s not working, **acknowledge that it’s a good decision**. The time you save by avoiding over-investment is valuable, and you should feel proud when you recognize it's time to switch paths.
   - The goal is to **make progress efficiently**, and switching early when something is overly time-consuming is exactly what successful problem-solvers do.

Next time you hit a block like this, try setting the time limit first, then follow the “Three-Step Pivot” approach. Remember, your energy and productivity matter more than pushing through a specific method that isn’t working. The more decisively you make those pivots, the more satisfying and rewarding your projects will become.
