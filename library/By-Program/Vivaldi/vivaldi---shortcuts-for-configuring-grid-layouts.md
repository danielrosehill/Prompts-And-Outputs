# Prompt

Great. Is there a way in Vivaldi to create shortcuts to open a group of tabs in a specific grid layout? Let's say I had 4 URLs that I wanted to open in a 2 x 2 laytout

# Output
Yes, Vivaldi allows you to create **Tab Sessions**, which can save a group of open tabs, and you can then restore them with a specific layout (such as a 2x2 grid). By saving your preferred URLs in a session and tiling them in a 2x2 layout, you can easily reopen them in the same arrangement.

Here’s how you can create a shortcut to open a group of tabs in a specific grid layout in Vivaldi:

### Steps to Create and Save a Group of Tabs in a 2x2 Grid Layout:

1. **Open the Tabs You Want to Tile**:
   - Open the 4 URLs that you want to use in your 2x2 layout.

2. **Tile the Tabs into a 2x2 Layout**:
   - Select all four tabs by holding `Ctrl` (or `Cmd` on macOS) and clicking on each tab.
   - Right-click on one of the selected tabs, go to **Tile Tabs** > **Tile to Grid**.
   - The tabs should now appear in a 2x2 grid.

3. **Save the Group as a Session**:
   - Click on the **Vivaldi menu** (Vivaldi icon in the top left) or use the **File** menu.
   - Navigate to **File** > **Save Open Tabs as Session**.
   - In the dialog that opens, give your session a name (e.g., "My 2x2 Grid Layout") and ensure all the tabs are selected.
   - Click **Save**.

### Steps to Open the Saved Session:

1. **Open the Saved Session**:
   - To reopen the session, go to **File** > **Open Saved Session**.
   - Select the session you saved earlier (e.g., "My 2x2 Grid Layout").
   - In the dialog, make sure **Open in a New Window** is checked (this helps preserve the tiling layout).
   - Click **Open**.

2. **Tile the Tabs Automatically**:
   - Once the session is opened in a new window, you may need to reapply the 2x2 tiling layout:
     - Select all tabs (`Ctrl` + click each tab).
     - Right-click and select **Tile Tabs** > **Tile to Grid**.

### Automating the Process with Custom Shortcuts:

While Vivaldi doesn’t have built-in shortcuts for opening sessions and applying specific layouts directly, you can streamline the process further by using the following options:

1. **Assigning a Custom Keyboard Shortcut for Session Management**:
   - Go to **Settings** > **Keyboard** > **Tabs**.
   - Look for the option called **Save Open Tabs as Session** and **Open Saved Session**.
   - You can assign a custom shortcut to quickly open your saved session with just a few keystrokes.

2. **Bookmarking the Group of URLs**:
   - If you prefer not to use sessions, you can bookmark all the tabs and open them as a group:
     - Right-click on an open tab and choose **Bookmark All Tabs**.
     - Save them in a folder (e.g., "My 2x2 Layout").
     - You can later right-click on the folder in the bookmarks bar and choose **Open All in New Window**.
     - Then manually tile the tabs into a grid layout.

### Summary of Workflow:
1. Open the URLs and arrange them in a 2x2 grid.
2. Save the layout as a session for future use.
3. Reopen the session from the menu or assign a custom shortcut.
4. Reapply the tiling (if necessary) after opening the session.

This setup ensures that you can easily return to your preferred grid layout with just a few clicks or a keyboard shortcut. Let me know if you need help automating this process further!
