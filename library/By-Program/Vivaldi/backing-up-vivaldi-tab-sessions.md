In **Vivaldi**, sessions are not automatically backed up by default. However, you can manually back them up or restore them if needed. Sessions are stored locally on your system, and there are ways to back them up and ensure you don't lose your saved tab arrangements.

### Where Are Vivaldi Sessions Stored?
Vivaldi stores session data in its user profile directory. On **Linux**, the path is typically:
```
~/.config/vivaldi/Default/Sessions/
```

This directory contains files representing your saved sessions. If you want to **back up your sessions**, you can manually copy the contents of this directory to another location.

### How to Back Up Vivaldi Sessions:
1. **Manual Backup**:
   - Navigate to the **Sessions** directory:
     ```bash
     cd ~/.config/vivaldi/Default/Sessions/
     ```
   - Copy the entire **Sessions** folder to a backup location (like a cloud service, external drive, or another directory):
     ```bash
     cp -r ~/.config/vivaldi/Default/Sessions/ ~/my-vivaldi-backups/sessions/
     ```

2. **Automated Backup**:
   - You can create a cron job or a script to automatically back up your sessions directory periodically to ensure you donâ€™t lose any saved sessions.
   - Example script to copy the session files daily:
     ```bash
     #!/bin/bash
     cp -r ~/.config/vivaldi/Default/Sessions/ ~/my-vivaldi-backups/sessions/
     ```

3. **Restoring Backups**:
   - If you need to restore your sessions, simply replace the **Sessions** folder in the Vivaldi profile directory with your backup.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     cp -r ~/my-vivaldi-backups/sessions/ ~/.config/vivaldi/Default/Sessions/
     ```

### Additional Backup Options:
1. **Backing Up Entire Vivaldi Profile**:
   - You can back up your entire Vivaldi profile, which includes not only sessions but also bookmarks, settings, and extensions.
   - The profile is typically stored here on **Linux**:
     ```
     ~/.config/vivaldi/Default/
     ```
   - Copy the entire `Default` folder to another location for a full backup:
     ```bash
     cp -r ~/.config/vivaldi/Default/ ~/my-vivaldi-backups/full-backup/
     ```

2. **Sync Feature**:
   - **Vivaldi Sync** allows you to synchronize bookmarks, passwords, settings, and open tabs across devices. However, as of now, **sessions are not included** in the Sync feature.
   - You can still use Sync to back up many other settings, but for sessions, manual or local backup is the best option.

### Conclusion:
Vivaldi **does not automatically back up sessions**, but you can easily create manual backups by copying the session files from the user profile directory. For added convenience, you can automate the process using scripts or cron jobs. Alternatively, consider backing up your entire Vivaldi profile to safeguard all your settings and data.
