# Prompt

I'm not able to control my monitor brightness with DDCUTIL. I'm using Fedora Linux and have a few external AOC monitors. I'm trying to configure a decreased screen brightness for the displays.

# Output

Based on the information provided, it seems you're having trouble controlling your AOC monitor brightness using ddcutil on Fedora Linux. This is a common issue, as not all monitors fully support DDC/CI (Display Data Channel Command Interface) or implement it correctly. Here are some steps you can try to troubleshoot and potentially resolve the issue:

1. Ensure ddcutil is properly installed and configured:

   ```
   sudo dnf install ddcutil
   ```

   Then, make sure the i2c-dev module is loaded:
   ```
   sudo modprobe i2c-dev
   ```

2. Check if ddcutil detects your monitors:

   ```
   sudo ddcutil detect
   ```

   This should list all detected monitors. If your AOC monitors are not listed, there might be an issue with detection.

3. Try to get the current brightness value:

   ```
   sudo ddcutil getvcp 10
   ```

   If this returns a value, it means ddcutil can communicate with your monitor.

4. Attempt to set the brightness:

   ```
   sudo ddcutil setvcp 10 50
   ```

   This tries to set the brightness to 50%. If it doesn't work, try different values.

5. If the above steps don't work, it's possible that your AOC monitors don't fully support DDC/CI or have a non-standard implementation. In this case, you might need to try alternative methods:

   - Use xrandr for software brightness control:
     ```
     xrandr --output HDMI-1 --brightness 0.7
     ```
     Replace HDMI-1 with your actual output name (use `xrandr` to list outputs).

   - Try using the "Brightness Controller" tool, which provides a GUI for adjusting brightness[2].

6. Check if your monitor has a "DDC/CI" option in its on-screen display menu. If it does, make sure it's enabled.

7. Some users have reported that disabling Dynamic Contrast on the monitor settings can help ddcutil work properly[9].

8. If you're still having issues, you might want to check the ddcutil GitHub issues page for any known problems with AOC monitors or similar issues[10].

Remember that hardware brightness control via DDC/CI is not always reliable across all monitors and may depend on the specific model and firmware of your AOC displays. If none of these solutions work, you might need to resort to using the physical buttons on your monitors to adjust brightness.
