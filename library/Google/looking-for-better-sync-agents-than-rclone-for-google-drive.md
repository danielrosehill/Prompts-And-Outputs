# Prompt

When I try to mount it is doesn't work. Do you think rclone is the best program for this or maybe there are better ones? It seems buggy

# Output

If you're experiencing persistent issues with **rclone**, there are several alternatives you might consider for mounting and accessing Google Drive (including Shared Drives) on Linux. Each option has its own strengths and weaknesses, so it might be worth trying a few to see which one works best for your use case.

### Alternative Options

1. **google-drive-ocamlfuse**
   - **Overview**: This is a FUSE filesystem for Google Drive that allows you to mount your Google Drive (including Shared Drives) as a local filesystem.
   - **Installation**:
     ```bash
     sudo dnf install google-drive-ocamlfuse
     ```
   - **Configuration**:
     Run the following command to authorize your account:
     ```bash
     google-drive-ocamlfuse
     ```
   - **Mounting**:
     To mount, create a directory and use:
     ```bash
     mkdir -p /home/daniel/Cloud_Drives/Google/Shared-Drives/DSR-Holdings-Accounts
     google-drive-ocamlfuse /home/daniel/Cloud_Drives/Google/Shared-Drives/DSR-Holdings-Accounts
     ```

2. **gdrive**
   - **Overview**: This is a simple command-line utility for interacting with Google Drive.
   - **Installation**: Download the binary from the [gdrive GitHub releases](https://github.com/prasmussen/gdrive/releases).
   - **Usage**: You can list, upload, and download files easily, but it doesn't mount like a filesystem. If your use case can work with file uploads/downloads rather than real-time access, this might be sufficient.

3. **RaiDrive**
   - **Overview**: RaiDrive is a Windows application that allows you to map cloud storage as a network drive, but you can run it under Wine on Linux.
   - **Installation**: Install Wine on your system, then download and run RaiDrive. This might not be the most efficient method, but it could work depending on your needs.

4. **ExpanDrive**
   - **Overview**: ExpanDrive is a commercial software that allows you to mount various cloud storage services (including Google Drive) as local drives.
   - **Cost**: Paid software, but it offers a trial period.
   - **Installation**: Follow the instructions on the [ExpanDrive website](https://www.expandrive.com/).

5. **KDE Connect with WebDAV**
   - **Overview**: If you prefer a more integrated KDE solution, you can use KDE Connect with WebDAV to access Google Drive directly from Dolphin.
   - **Configuration**: Set up your Google Drive as a WebDAV resource and access it directly from your file manager.

### Troubleshooting rclone
Before switching away from **rclone**, it might be worth investigating potential fixes to the issues you're experiencing. Here are some common troubleshooting steps:
- Ensure you’re using the latest version of rclone.
- Experiment with different VFS cache modes or settings.
- Check system logs for any errors related to rclone.
- Test the mounting in a minimal environment (e.g., without additional desktop effects or heavy resource usage).

### Conclusion
**rclone** is a powerful tool, but if it’s causing persistent issues, trying alternatives like **google-drive-ocamlfuse** or **ExpanDrive** might yield better results for your workflow. Each tool has its pros and cons, so testing a few options is the best way to find what works for you. Let me know if you want to explore any of these options further!
