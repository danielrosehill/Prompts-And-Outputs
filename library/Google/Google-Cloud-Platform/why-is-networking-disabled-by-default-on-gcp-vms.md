# Prompt

out of interest, why is http and https disabled by default when creating instances in gcp. don't most people use these to host websites that they want to be accssible from the internet?

# Output

The reason **HTTP** and **HTTPS** traffic is **disabled by default** when creating instances in **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** is mainly for **security** and **best practices** in cloud environments. Here are the key reasons why GCP (and other cloud providers) take this approach:

### 1. **Security by Default**
- **Restricting Public Access**: GCPâ€™s default settings prioritize security by ensuring that no open ports are exposed to the public internet unless explicitly allowed. This reduces the risk of accidental exposure of services or data to unauthorized access.
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: By default, GCP applies the **principle of least privilege**, which means that resources are configured with minimal access and permissions. Only the ports and services that are necessary should be opened intentionally.
- **Preventing Misconfigurations**: New users might inadvertently expose sensitive services (such as admin panels, databases, etc.) if HTTP/HTTPS were enabled by default, leading to potential security vulnerabilities. Disabling these by default gives administrators more control and forces them to consciously configure public access only when needed.

### 2. **Not Every VM is Public**
- **Diverse Use Cases**: While many users deploy VMs to host websites, not all VM instances are meant to be public-facing. Some instances might be used for:
  - **Internal services**: Running backend applications, databases, or APIs that do not need public access.
  - **Private networks**: Virtual machines that operate within a private or isolated environment (e.g., connected to a VPN or internal corporate network).
- Enabling HTTP/HTTPS by default could unnecessarily expose VMs that are meant for private or internal use only.

### 3. **Customizable Firewall Rules**
- **User Control**: Disabling HTTP and HTTPS by default gives users full control over which traffic to allow and from which sources. Users can create custom firewall rules to allow specific types of traffic, from specific IP ranges, or only after certain security configurations (e.g., SSL/TLS certificates) are set up.
- **Custom Traffic Configurations**: Some users may want to only expose HTTPS (for secure traffic) and not HTTP, or may want to configure additional security layers (like VPNs or private networks) before opening services to the internet.

### 4. **Encouraging Proper Setup of HTTPS**
- **Encouraging HTTPS Use**: Disabling HTTP/HTTPS by default encourages users to take the necessary steps to secure their website, such as setting up SSL/TLS certificates before making a website publicly accessible. This aligns with best practices for hosting secure websites.

### Conclusion
While it may seem counterintuitive at first, especially for public-facing websites, the default settings help protect users from accidentally exposing services to the internet and reduce security risks. It forces intentional configuration and ensures that users only allow the traffic they really need for their specific use case. Once the appropriate firewall rules are configured, the VMs can safely host public-facing websites.

If you are planning to host a website, enabling HTTP and HTTPS traffic in the firewall settings after creating the instance is a simple and intentional step, ensuring you're opening only the ports necessary for your project.
