Yes, **Termius** can connect to VMs on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using the **gcloud SDK**, but there are a few steps to configure it properly. Termius is a popular SSH client that allows you to manage and connect to your servers easily. Here's how to set it up:

### Steps to Connect Termius to GCP VMs Using gcloud SDK

1. **Install gcloud SDK**:
   - Ensure that you have the **gcloud SDK** installed on your local machine. You can download it from the [Google Cloud SDK documentation](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install).

2. **Authenticate with Google Cloud**:
   - Open a terminal and run the following command to authenticate your gcloud session:
     ```bash
     gcloud auth login
     ```
   - Follow the prompts to log in with your Google account.

3. **Set the Project**:
   - Set your active project in gcloud:
     ```bash
     gcloud config set project YOUR_PROJECT_ID
     ```

4. **Retrieve SSH Keys**:
   - The gcloud SDK automatically manages SSH keys for you, creating and using them for connections. Make sure you have SSH access enabled on your VM instances.

5. **Get the External IP of the VM**:
   - Use the following command to get the external IP address of your VM:
     ```bash
     gcloud compute instances list
     ```
   - Note the external IP address of the instance you want to connect to.

6. **Configure Termius**:
   - Open **Termius** and create a new host entry:
     - **Host**: Enter the external IP address of the VM.
     - **Port**: Typically `22` for SSH.
     - **User**: This will usually be `your_username` or `ubuntu` for Ubuntu instances.
     - **SSH Key**: You can configure Termius to use the SSH keys managed by gcloud. If you've set up your SSH keys correctly with gcloud, Termius should recognize them.

7. **Connecting**:
   - Once everything is configured, simply click to connect to your VM from Termius. The SSH connection should be established using the SSH keys created by gcloud.

### Additional Considerations

- **Firewall Rules**: Ensure that your GCP firewall rules allow incoming SSH traffic (port 22) to your VM instance.
- **IAM Permissions**: Ensure that your Google account has sufficient permissions to access the VM instances.
- **Custom Key Management**: If you prefer to use custom SSH keys, you can generate them and add them to your VM instances using the gcloud command or through the GCP Console.

### Conclusion

By following these steps, you can easily connect Termius to your GCP VMs using the gcloud SDK. This setup allows you to leverage Termiusâ€™s user-friendly interface while benefiting from the security features of the gcloud SDK for managing SSH connections.
