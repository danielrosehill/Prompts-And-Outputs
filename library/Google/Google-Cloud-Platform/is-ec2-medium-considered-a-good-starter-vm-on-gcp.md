The **t2.medium** or **t3.medium** EC2 instance type can be considered a good starter VM for a personal project like deploying Outline KM, especially for moderate workloads. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of its specifications and suitability for your needs:

### Specifications of t2.medium / t3.medium

- **vCPUs**: 2 vCPUs
- **Memory**: 4 GB RAM
- **Storage**: EBS-optimized with additional Elastic Block Store (EBS) volumes available
- **Network Performance**: Up to moderate levels of network performance

### Advantages for Personal Projects

1. **Balanced Performance**:
   - The **2 vCPUs and 4 GB of RAM** provide a decent balance for running both the Outline application and a PostgreSQL database, especially for personal use where demand may fluctuate.

2. **Cost-Effective**:
   - t2 and t3 instances are relatively affordable, making them suitable for personal projects. You can also take advantage of the AWS Free Tier if eligible, which offers up to **750 hours/month** of t2.micro instances for the first 12 months.

3. **Burstable Performance**:
   - The **t2** instance type allows for burstable CPU performance, meaning that it can handle spikes in demand while remaining cost-effective during low-usage periods. This is particularly useful for occasional intensive usage when you might be actively writing or reading notes.

4. **Scalability**:
   - If your usage grows or if you require more resources, you can easily upgrade to larger instance types without needing to migrate to a different architecture.

### Considerations

1. **Memory Limitations**:
   - If your usage becomes intensive (e.g., multiple simultaneous actions or a larger database), you might hit the memory limit. In such cases, monitoring usage will be important to determine if an upgrade is necessary.

2. **Storage Configuration**:
   - Make sure to configure your EBS storage appropriately (e.g., using General Purpose SSD) to ensure good performance for your database operations.

3. **Backup and Security**:
   - Set up regular backups and security measures, as with any cloud deployment. Use IAM roles and security groups effectively to manage access.

### Conclusion

Overall, a **t2.medium** or **t3.medium** EC2 instance is a solid choice for a personal project like Outline KM. It provides enough resources for moderate workloads and allows for cost-effective and scalable solutions. Just be mindful of your usage patterns and monitor performance to ensure it meets your needs as your project grows.
