Yes, you can configure your preferred font and styles as the **default** for all Google Docs by creating a custom **default template** with your chosen font, headers, and other formatting options. Here’s how you can set this up:

### Steps to Set Default Styles in Google Docs:

1. **Open Google Docs**:
   - Open a new or existing document where you have applied the styles (font, headers, etc.) that you want to use as the default.

2. **Set Your Font and Styles**:
   - Highlight some text, go to the **font menu**, and choose the font you like.
   - Do the same for **paragraph styles** (e.g., Heading 2 for headers) by selecting the text and applying the style you want to make default.
   
3. **Update the Styles**:
   - Once you have formatted text in your preferred style, set it as the default style for that text type:
     - Highlight the text for which you want to save the style.
     - In the toolbar, go to the **Styles** dropdown (usually labeled as “Normal text” or “Heading”).
     - Click the arrow next to the style you want to update (e.g., **Heading 2**).
     - Choose **Update ‘Heading 2’ to match** or the respective style for Normal text, Heading 1, etc.

4. **Set Default Styles for All New Docs**:
   - Once you've updated all the styles (normal text, headings, etc.) in the document:
     - Go to **Format > Paragraph Styles > Options**.
     - Click **Save as my default styles**.
   - This will make your chosen styles the default for all new Google Docs you create.

5. **Creating a Template (Optional)**:
   - If you want more flexibility, you can also create a **template** that includes your default styles:
     - Open a new Google Doc, apply your desired formatting.
     - Once finished, **save** this document as a template.
     - While Google Docs doesn’t have a built-in template gallery for personal templates, you can bookmark the template and simply **make a copy** each time you need a new document.

### Setting Headers (H2) as Default:
   - If you want to make **H2 headers** (Heading 2) your default for all headings:
     - After setting your **Heading 2** style as described above, every time you use **Ctrl+Alt+2** (or choose Heading 2 from the styles dropdown), it will apply your custom header style.

Now, every time you open a new Google Doc, it should use your preferred font and styles by default!
