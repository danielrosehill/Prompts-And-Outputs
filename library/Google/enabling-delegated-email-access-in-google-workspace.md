 To enable the **"Grant access to your account"** feature in Google Workspace, you'll need to adjust settings in the **Google Admin Console** to make sure account delegation is allowed. Follow these steps:

### Step 1: Access the Google Admin Console
1. **Go to the Admin Console**:
   - Visit [admin.google.com](https://admin.google.com) and sign in with your **admin account** for the business workspace (`daniel@yourbusiness.cloud`).

### Step 2: Navigate to User Settings
1. **Click on "Apps"**:
   - In the Admin Console dashboard, click on **"Apps"**.

2. **Click on "Google Workspace"**:
   - Select **"Google Workspace"** from the list of apps.

3. **Click on "Gmail"**:
   - Select **"Gmail"** to access Gmail settings for your organization.

### Step 3: Allow Mail Delegation
1. **Go to User Settings**:
   - Under the Gmail settings, select **"User settings"**.

2. **Enable Mail Delegation**:
   - Scroll down to the **"Mail delegation"** section.
   - Make sure the option to **"Let users delegate access to their mailbox"** is checked. This allows users to grant other people access to their mailbox.

3. **Save Changes**:
   - After enabling this setting, click **"Save"** at the bottom to apply the changes.

### Step 4: Propagation Time
- The changes may take some time to propagate (up to 24 hours, but often much quicker).
  
### Step 5: Test Delegation
1. **Log Back In to Your Business Account** (`daniel@yourbusiness.cloud`):
   - Go to [Gmail](https://mail.google.com) and log in again after the settings have been updated.

2. **Go to Gmail Settings**:
   - Click on the **gear icon** > **"See all settings"** > **"Accounts and Import"**.

3. **Grant Access**:
   - You should now see the option to **"Grant access to your account"** under the **"Accounts and Import"** tab.

This should allow you to successfully enable the feature and grant access to your personal workspace account.

If you donâ€™t have admin privileges, you may need to contact your Google Workspace admin to make these changes. Let me know if you need further guidance!
