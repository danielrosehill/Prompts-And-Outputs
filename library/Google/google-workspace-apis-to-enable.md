# Prompt

I was thinking recently that it might be a good idea to tun on a few of the Google Workspace APIs. Could you give me a list of the basic ones that it might be sensible to enable for this kind of thing?

# Output

For the kind of tasks you're aiming to automate, such as analyzing orders and scanning emails, enabling certain **Google Workspace APIs** can streamline the process. Here’s a list of the essential Google Workspace APIs that would make sense to enable:

### 1. **Gmail API**
   - **Purpose**: This API allows you to read, send, delete, and manage email threads and messages directly from your Gmail account.
   - **Use Case**: You can use it to programmatically retrieve emails, such as order confirmations and receipts, and then process them to extract relevant details for business deductions.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Search and filter emails (e.g., searching for keywords like "receipt" or "order confirmation").
     - Fetch email metadata (subject, sender, date).
     - Parse email content to extract receipts and expenses.

### 2. **Google Drive API**
   - **Purpose**: This API allows you to store, organize, and share files in Google Drive programmatically.
   - **Use Case**: You can use it to store extracted data (like parsed receipts or CSVs of order histories) in a centralized location. It’s also useful for backing up any files or generating reports on the fly.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Upload and manage files in Google Drive.
     - Organize receipts or accounting documents in a shared drive for easy access.

### 3. **Google Sheets API**
   - **Purpose**: This API allows you to read from and write to Google Sheets.
   - **Use Case**: You can create a system to automatically populate a shared Google Sheet with extracted business expenses or utility data. It can also help in managing and reviewing expenses from a user-friendly interface.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Update or append data into spreadsheets for accounting or tracking purposes.
     - Perform calculations and generate reports dynamically.
     - Share sheets with collaborators or automate report generation.

### 4. **Google Calendar API**
   - **Purpose**: This API provides access to manage and organize events in Google Calendar.
   - **Use Case**: If you receive calendar invites related to business meetings, events, or transactions, you can programmatically retrieve this information and link it with expenses (e.g., associating calendar events with travel expenses).
   - **Key Features**:
     - Retrieve calendar events to tie business activities (meetings, conferences) with expenses.
     - Automate the addition of recurring business-related events that generate expenses.

### 5. **Google People API**
   - **Purpose**: This API provides access to contact and profile information.
   - **Use Case**: If your business deductions are associated with specific contacts or vendors, the People API can help you cross-reference expenses with contacts. You could automate tagging of business-related contacts or suppliers.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Retrieve and manage your contacts and details for expense categorization.
     - Associate expenses with specific people or suppliers in your contact list.

### 6. **Google Cloud Vision API** (Optional)
   - **Purpose**: This API provides powerful OCR (Optical Character Recognition) capabilities.
   - **Use Case**: If you receive scanned or image-based receipts, the Vision API can extract text from those images and help identify key business-related expenses.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Extract text from receipts or documents stored as images.
     - Automate scanning of receipt images to extract item descriptions and prices.

### Workflow Example Using These APIs:
- **Gmail API**: Retrieve emails containing order confirmations and receipts.
- **Google Drive API**: Store any extracted data, such as CSV files or categorized expenses.
- **Google Sheets API**: Automatically populate a shared Google Sheet with business expenses extracted from emails and documents.
- **Google Calendar API**: Tie business expenses to specific meetings or trips in your calendar.
- **Google People API**: Associate expenses with contacts (e.g., vendors or clients).
- **Google Cloud Vision API**: If needed, extract text from image-based receipts or invoices.

These APIs provide a comprehensive solution for handling business deductions, data extraction, and centralizing your information. You can easily integrate them into your workflow using Python or another language with Google’s SDKs.
