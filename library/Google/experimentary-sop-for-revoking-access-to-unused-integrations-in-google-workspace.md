**Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Reviewing Third-Party Access to Google Workspace**

**Purpose**: To ensure that only necessary third-party services have access to the Google Workspace account, thereby minimizing security risks and maintaining data privacy.

**Frequency**: Monthly

**Steps**:

1. **Access the Connections Page**
   - Go to the following URL: [Google Account Connections Page](https://myaccount.google.com/connections?continue=https%3A%2F%2Fmyaccount.google.com%2Fsecurity%3Fnlr%3D1%26authuser%3D0&authuser=0).

2. **Review Connected Services**
   - Review the list of third-party apps and services that have access to your Google Workspace account.
   - Identify services that are no longer in use or no longer necessary for business operations.

3. **Revoke Unnecessary Access**
   - Click on any service that you no longer require and select the option to **Remove Access**.

4. **Document the Changes**
   - Record the date of the review and list the services that had their access revoked.
   - Document any issues or concerns and note any follow-up actions required.

5. **Confirmation**
   - Verify that all access removals have been completed by reloading the page and ensuring the listed services are correct.

**Notes**:
- Always be cautious when removing access to ensure that essential tools required for operations are not impacted.
- If unsure whether a service is necessary, consult your team or test its absence before permanent removal.
