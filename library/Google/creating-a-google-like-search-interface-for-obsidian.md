# Prompt
Are there any Obsidian extensions to get a Google like search interface over a search vault? Or local search programs that can achieve the same indexing a local folder?

For **Obsidian** users looking for a **Google-like search interface** or more powerful search capabilities within a vault, there are several **extensions** and **local search tools** that can enhance the default search functionality. Here's how you can achieve better indexing and search experience in **Obsidian** or for local folders in general:

### Obsidian Extensions for Enhanced Search
