# Prompt

I've been using Google Workspace to manage my small business for years but I feel like I've outgrown it. I need to invoice clients and I can't do that within Workspace. I used Airtable recently and being able to configure my own custom data tables was very powerful. I'd like a dedicated company wiki too where I can begin storing AI outputs like those which I get from Claude and which are helpful for my business. Can you think of any directions I could take?

# Output

Based on your needs and experiences, it seems you're looking for a more comprehensive and customizable solution that can handle invoicing, data management, and knowledge storage. Here are some suggestions that could meet your requirements:

1. Zoho One

Zoho One could be an excellent upgrade from Google Workspace for your small business. It offers a comprehensive suite of business applications, including:

- Zoho Invoice for client invoicing
- Zoho Creator for custom database creation (similar to Airtable)
- Zoho Wiki for internal knowledge management
- Zoho CRM for customer relationship management
- Zoho Workplace for email, document creation, and collaboration (similar to Google Workspace)

**Pros:**
- Comprehensive solution covering multiple business needs
- AI assistant (Zia) integrated across apps
- Customizable and scalable
- Affordable pricing for the range of features offered
- Integrates with Backblaze B2 for backups

**Cons:**
- Learning curve due to the number of applications
- Some advanced features may require higher-tier plans

Pricing: Starts at $37/user/month (billed annually), which fits within your $100/month budget[1].

2. HubSpot

While primarily known for its CRM and marketing tools, HubSpot also offers:

- Invoicing capabilities
- Custom objects for database-like functionality
- Knowledge base tools for internal wikis
- AI-powered content creation and optimization tools

**Pros:**
- User-friendly interface
- Excellent marketing and sales tools
- Regular updates and new feature releases

**Cons:**
- More advanced features require higher-tier plans
- Can become expensive as you add more tools and contacts

Pricing: The Starter CRM Suite starts at $50/month for 2 users[1].

3. Notion

Notion is a versatile tool that could replace several of your current solutions:

- Custom databases (similar to Airtable)
- Wiki-style knowledge management
- Project management
- Document collaboration

While Notion doesn't offer native invoicing, you could integrate it with a dedicated invoicing tool like Wave (which is free for basic invoicing)[1][3].

**Pros:**
- Highly customizable and flexible
- Excellent for knowledge management and collaboration
- Affordable pricing

**Cons:**
- Lacks native invoicing capabilities
- May require some time to set up and organize effectively

Pricing: Team plan starts at $8/user/month

4. Confluence + Jira + Trello (Atlassian Suite)

While this combination doesn't include invoicing, it offers powerful tools for knowledge management, project tracking, and data organization:

- Confluence for wiki and knowledge management
- Jira for project and task management
- Trello for visual organization (similar to Airtable in some aspects)

You could pair this with a dedicated invoicing tool like FreshBooks or Wave[1][3].

**Pros:**
- Robust tools for collaboration and project management
- Integrates well with many other business tools
- Scalable for growing businesses

**Cons:**
- Lacks native invoicing capabilities
- Can be complex to set up and manage
- Pricing can add up when combining multiple tools

Pricing: Varies based on the combination of tools and team size

Conclusion:

Given your requirements for invoicing, custom data management (like Airtable), and a company wiki, Zoho One appears to be the most comprehensive solution that fits within your budget. It offers all the functionalities you need in one integrated platform, including AI capabilities and backup options to Backblaze B2.

However, if you prefer a more modular approach or want to prioritize certain aspects, the other options could be worth exploring. Remember to take advantage of free trials to test these solutions and ensure they meet your specific needs before committing.
