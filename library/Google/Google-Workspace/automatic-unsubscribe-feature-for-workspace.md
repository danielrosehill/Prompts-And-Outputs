Unfortunately, Gmail or Google Workspace does not provide a built-in feature to **automatically unsubscribe** from every newsletter or promotional email. However, you can use some methods and tools to make this process easier and manage unwanted emails more effectively.

Here are a few strategies to help you unsubscribe from newsletters or promotional emails:

### 1. **Gmail's Built-In Unsubscribe Feature**
Gmail does offer a **built-in unsubscribe** option for emails that contain an unsubscribe link in their headers. When Gmail detects this, it shows an **"Unsubscribe"** button at the top of the email, next to the sender's email address.

#### Steps:
1. Open a newsletter or promotional email.
2. Look for the **"Unsubscribe"** link at the top next to the sender's name.
3. Click **"Unsubscribe"**, and Gmail will automatically process the unsubscribe request or redirect you to the sender's unsubscribe page.

However, this still requires you to manually review each email.

### 2. **Filters to Automatically Archive or Delete Newsletters**
While Gmail can’t automatically unsubscribe you from newsletters, you can create **filters** to automatically archive or delete them as they come in. This way, they won’t clutter your inbox, even if you don’t technically unsubscribe.

#### Steps:
1. **Create a Filter**:
   - In Gmail, click the **search bar** and type something like `unsubscribe OR newsletter`.
   - Click the **small arrow** at the right of the search bar to open the advanced search menu.
   - At the bottom, click **Create filter**.

2. **Set Actions**:
   - Choose to **skip the inbox** (archive), **delete**, or apply a **label** to these emails so you can review them later.
   - Click **Create filter**.

This will automatically handle any incoming newsletters without requiring you to manually unsubscribe.

### 3. **Third-Party Tools to Unsubscribe from Newsletters**
There are third-party tools that integrate with Gmail or Google Workspace and offer bulk or automatic unsubscribe features. These tools scan your inbox for newsletters and give you an easy way to unsubscribe from them.

#### 1. **Unroll.Me**
   - **Unroll.Me** is a popular free tool that connects to your Gmail inbox, scans for newsletters, and allows you to **bulk unsubscribe** from them.
   - It also lets you organize emails into a daily "Rollup" to minimize inbox clutter.

   **Website**: [Unroll.Me](https://unroll.me/)

#### 2. **Leave Me Alone**
   - **Leave Me Alone** offers a privacy-focused alternative that helps you unsubscribe from unwanted emails and newsletters.
   - It scans your inbox and lets you unsubscribe from multiple newsletters at once.

   **Website**: [Leave Me Alone](https://leavemealone.app/)

#### 3. **Clean Email**
   - **Clean Email** offers tools for email cleaning and management, including bulk unsubscribing from newsletters.
   - It connects to Gmail and helps you clean up your inbox with filters, bulk actions, and unsubscribe features.

   **Website**: [Clean Email](https://clean.email/)

### 4. **Google Workspace Admin Tools for Bulk Unsubscribe**
If you're a **Google Workspace Admin**, you can’t directly manage unsubscribing users from newsletters, but you do have some control over how unwanted emails are handled at a **domain level**:
- Use **Content Compliance Policies** to filter out promotional emails for all users.
- **Spam filter settings** can help prevent newsletters from reaching users' inboxes.

### 5. **Use Email Clients with Unsubscribe Features**
Some third-party email clients, such as **Microsoft Outlook** or **Apple Mail**, offer features to make it easier to bulk unsubscribe from newsletters or promotional emails. You can connect Gmail or Google Workspace accounts to these clients and manage your inbox using their tools.

### Summary of Options:
1. **Manually use Gmail's built-in unsubscribe link** for each newsletter.
2. **Create filters** to automatically archive or delete newsletters and promotional emails.
3. Use **third-party tools** like **Unroll.Me**, **Leave Me Alone**, or **Clean Email** to bulk unsubscribe.
4. If you're a Google Workspace admin, consider **email filters** and **compliance rules** at the organizational level.

While none of these options fully automate the process within Gmail itself, these tools and strategies can significantly reduce the manual effort required to manage or unsubscribe from newsletters.
