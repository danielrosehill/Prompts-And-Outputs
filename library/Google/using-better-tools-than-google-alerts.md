# Prompt

Getting back to my job! I try to keep up with a lot of news on a range of topics to do with financial sustainability but it's a bit overwhelming. I have Google Alerts set up but I never really enjoy reading them. Can you suggest some other ways of doing media and news monitoring that might be a little friendlier and fun?

# Output

Here are a few friendlier and more engaging alternatives to Google Alerts for monitoring news on financial sustainability:

### 1. **RSS Feeds with a Custom Reader**
   - **Why it's fun**: You can personalize an RSS reader to include only sources you love, and organize them into categories like sustainability, climate, and finance.
   - **How**: Use tools like **Feedly** or **Inoreader** to subscribe to blogs, news outlets, or specific sections of financial sustainability websites. You can choose to get daily digests, prioritize topics, and integrate multimedia (podcasts, videos) in your feed.
   - **Bonus**: Many RSS readers include a clean reading mode for a distraction-free experience.

### 2. **Podcasts and Audio News**
   - **Why it's fun**: Podcasts let you stay informed without having to read! You can listen to news on sustainability while doing other tasks.
   - **How**: Platforms like **Spotify**, **Apple Podcasts**, and **Google Podcasts** have many shows on sustainability, financial innovation, and climate finance. Look for shows like **"Sustainability Leaders"**, **"Impact Investing Podcast"**, or **"The Green Finance Podcast"**.
   - **Bonus**: Many news outlets also have daily podcast versions of their major stories.

### 3. **Newsletters with Personality**
   - **Why it's fun**: Newsletters are often curated by passionate individuals, giving a human touch to updates. Some have humor, insights, and personal takes, making them more enjoyable than alerts.
   - **How**: Sign up for newsletters like **"Sustainable Finance Daily"**, **"GreenBiz"**, or **"ImpactAlpha"**. Platforms like **Substack** allow you to discover independent writers focused on sustainability and finance.
   - **Bonus**: You can skim through email summaries at your own pace, or save them for later.

### 4. **Customized Twitter Lists**
   - **Why it's fun**: Twitter is fast-paced and interactive. You can engage with experts, follow breaking news, and curate your feed to focus on your specific interests.
   - **How**: Create or follow public **Twitter lists** that group sustainability and financial thought leaders, journalists, and organizations in one place. Tools like **TweetDeck** make it easy to manage and scan multiple lists.
   - **Bonus**: Twitter threads often break down complex topics into digestible bites.

### 5. **Automated News Summaries via AI Tools**
   - **Why it's fun**: AI-based platforms can summarize news articles, making it quicker to digest long reports and stay updated.
   - **How**: Try tools like **Perplexity AI**, **Summari**, or use **ChatGPT** itself to generate a quick news summary. Some apps, like **Pocket**, also offer text-to-speech features to turn articles into audio.
   - **Bonus**: You get concise versions of important news, curated to your preferences.

### 6. **Interactive News Platforms**
   - **Why it's fun**: Platforms like **Flipboard** and **Medium** offer interactive ways to browse news based on interests. Flipboard, for instance, turns your topics into a digital magazine format, making it visually appealing.
   - **How**: Subscribe to sustainability and finance sections, and use the appâ€™s algorithms to suggest content based on what you engage with most.
   - **Bonus**: Medium also has discussions and thought pieces that can provide deeper insights, often presented in a conversational style.

### 7. **Video News**
   - **Why it's fun**: Watching news videos or documentaries adds a visual and emotional element that reading often lacks.
   - **How**: Use YouTube or **Bloomberg Green**, which offers video content on environmental and sustainability issues. Channels like **DW Planet A**, **The Guardian's Climate Channel**, or **BBC Global News** often provide video reports on finance and sustainability.
   - **Bonus**: Many platforms allow you to create playlists or subscribe to specific topics, so you always have fresh content waiting.

By diversifying your sources and formats, you can make news monitoring a more engaging and enjoyable part of your routine!
