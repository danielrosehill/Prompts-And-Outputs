In the **Terminal & SSH add-on** for **Home Assistant OS**, the **`authorized_keys`** section is located in the **configuration settings** for the add-on. Here is how you can find and add your SSH public key:

### **Location of the `authorized_keys` Section**:
1. **Access the Terminal & SSH Add-on**:
   - Open **Home Assistant**.
   - Go to the **Supervisor** tab (or **Settings > Add-ons**, depending on your version).
   - Find the **Terminal & SSH** add-on in the list of installed add-ons and click on it.

2. **Navigate to the Configuration Tab**:
   - After opening the add-on, you should see different tabs, such as **Info**, **Configuration**, and **Logs**.
   - Click on the **Configuration** tab.

3. **Find the `authorized_keys` Section**:
   - In the **Configuration** tab, you will see a **YAML-like text box** where you can configure various settings for the add-on.
   - The default configuration will look something like this:
     ```yaml
     ssh:
       username: root
       password: ''
       authorized_keys: []
       sftp: false
       compatibility_mode: false
     ```
   - The **`authorized_keys`** line is where you need to add your SSH key. It is empty by default (`[]`), but you will need to modify it to include your SSH public key.

4. **Add Your SSH Key**:
   - Replace the empty list (`[]`) with your **SSH public key** in YAML format. It should look like:
     ```yaml
     ssh:
       username: root
       password: ''
       authorized_keys:
         - ssh-rsa xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxMruWE3RNIeAyP/xxxxxxxNv/xxxxxxxVpQz+DdS2VEaxWCm9/gjuIWJuXKzW4z6Kc7lcwgq/ZSCnDiBNQ6YRQKoUUO1W9Q5OlbAw6/yQgxvh57m0/xxxxxxx80hKSVCVuOm2J/tMyvf+xxxxxxxmqiPZsGztj7doJfkTbpRMzxL/xxxxxxxM1qvEOO36k= daniel@danielworkstation
       sftp: false
       compatibility_mode: false
     ```

5. **Save the Configuration**:
   - Once you've pasted your public key into the `authorized_keys` section, click **Save** to apply the changes.

6. **Start or Restart the Add-on**:
   - Go to the **Info** tab of the SSH add-on.
   - If the add-on is already running, click **Restart**. If itâ€™s not running, click **Start**.

After adding your key and restarting the add-on, you should be able to SSH into your Home Assistant instance using the **private key** associated with the public key you added. 

### **Summary**:
- Navigate to **Supervisor** > **Terminal & SSH** add-on > **Configuration**.
- Add your SSH public key under the **`authorized_keys`** section.
- Save the configuration and start or restart the add-on.
