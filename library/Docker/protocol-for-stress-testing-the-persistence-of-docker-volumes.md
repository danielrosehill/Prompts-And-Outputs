**Summary:** You want to "stress test" your Outline KM system (running on Docker) to ensure that your persistent volumes are set up correctly and that the system can handle various scenarios without data loss or failures.

### Protocol for Stress Testing Persistent Volumes in Outline KM

To stress test your Outline KM system and verify that your Docker volumes are properly configured for persistence, you can follow a series of planned actions. This protocol will help you confirm that data remains intact under different conditions, including service restarts, Docker reboots, and system stress.

### Step 1: Prepare Your Environment for Testing

1. **Backup Existing Data (If Any)**
   - Before running any tests, make sure to back up your existing Outline data and PostgreSQL database. You can use Docker commands to create snapshots or use the `pg_dump` command for the PostgreSQL database:
     ```bash
     docker exec -t <postgres-container-id> pg_dump -U outline -d outline > backup.sql
     ```

2. **Document the Initial State**
   - Take note of the current setup, including the number of documents, existing folders, collections, and any data configurations.

### Step 2: Simulate Normal Use with Continuous Write and Read Operations

1. **Create and Upload a Series of Documents**
   - Use the Outline interface or its API to create multiple new documents in quick succession. Ensure that these documents vary in content, size, and structure (e.g., text, images, attachments).
   - **Automate Document Creation**:
     - If you want to automate this, use a script to upload documents via the Outline API. This can simulate multiple users adding content at once.

2. **Read and Modify Documents Simultaneously**
   - Open multiple documents and modify them. Save the changes, and check if changes are reflected across other connected devices.
   - **Note**: Monitor any lags or errors, which could indicate issues with Docker or network performance.

3. **Monitor Logs and Performance**
   - Use Docker logs to monitor for errors or warnings during these operations:
     ```bash
     docker logs <outline-container-id> --follow
     ```

### Step 3: Restart and Reboot Scenarios

1. **Restart Outline Container**
   - Restart the Outline container without stopping the PostgreSQL or Redis containers:
     ```bash
     docker restart <outline-container-id>
     ```
   - Verify that all documents, collections, and settings are still intact. Ensure the changes made before the restart are still saved.

2. **Restart PostgreSQL and Redis Containers**
   - Restart the PostgreSQL and Redis containers separately to confirm that the Outline container can still connect and function correctly:
     ```bash
     docker restart <postgres-container-id>
     docker restart <redis-container-id>
     ```
   - Test document creation and editing to ensure smooth reconnections.

3. **Reboot Entire Docker System**
   - Restart the Docker service or daemon:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl restart docker
     ```
   - Ensure all containers (Outline, PostgreSQL, Redis) come back online automatically. Verify data persistence by checking that all previously created documents are still available.

4. **Reboot Google Cloud VM**
   - Execute a full system reboot of the VM to simulate a power outage or system crash:
     ```bash
     sudo reboot
     ```
   - After the VM restarts, connect back and verify that the Outline system and data are intact:
     ```bash
     gcloud compute ssh <vm-instance-name> --zone <zone>
     ```

### Step 4: Simulate System Stress (High Load Testing)

1. **Simulate High Traffic**
   - Use a tool like **Apache JMeter** or **locust.io** to simulate multiple users accessing Outline KM at the same time. Create multiple connections, perform document creation, editing, and browsing, and see how the system behaves.
   - **Monitor Resource Utilization**: Track CPU, memory, and disk I/O on your Google Cloud VM during this stress test to identify any performance bottlenecks.

2. **Verify Data Integrity During High Load**
   - While the system is under load, perform a series of read and write operations:
     - Create documents.
     - Edit existing ones.
     - Delete some documents.
   - After the high-load period, verify that all operations completed successfully and no data was lost or corrupted.

### Step 5: Check Data Persistence After Manual and Unexpected Shutdowns

1. **Force Stop and Start Containers**
   - Force stop the Outline container without a graceful shutdown:
     ```bash
     docker kill <outline-container-id>
     ```
   - Restart it and verify that all data remains intact:
     ```bash
     docker start <outline-container-id>
     ```

2. **Simulate Unexpected VM Shutdown**
   - You can simulate an unexpected shutdown by stopping the Google Cloud VM forcefully through the Google Cloud Console or command-line:
     ```bash
     gcloud compute instances stop <vm-instance-name> --zone <zone>
     ```
   - After forcing a stop, restart the VM and check if all data persists correctly.

### Step 6: Monitor and Log Results

1. **Use Docker Logs for Insight**
   - Continuously monitor Docker logs for any anomalies:
     ```bash
     docker logs <outline-container-id> --follow
     ```

2. **Check Disk Space and Docker Volumes**
   - Ensure that your persistent volumes are properly configured and thereâ€™s no unexpected growth in disk usage:
     ```bash
     docker volume inspect <volume-name>
     df -h
     ```

3. **Verify PostgreSQL Data**
   - Use `psql` commands to check that the `documents` table still has all the expected entries:
     ```sql
     SELECT COUNT(*) FROM documents;
     ```

### Step 7: Prepare for Regular Backups and Monitoring

1. **Automate Regular Backups**
   - Schedule periodic backups of your PostgreSQL data using cron jobs or Docker backup strategies to maintain data integrity even if issues arise:
     ```bash
     docker exec -t <postgres-container-id> pg_dump -U outline -d outline > /path/to/backup/daily_backup.sql
     ```

2. **Set Up Monitoring and Alerts**
   - Consider using tools like **Prometheus** and **Grafana** for real-time monitoring of resource usage, container health, and more.
   - Set up alerts to notify you of potential issues like high CPU usage, low disk space, or container failures.

### Summary of Stress Test Protocol:
1. **Simulate Normal Use**: Create and edit documents while monitoring the system.
2. **Restart Services**: Restart individual containers and the entire Docker system.
3. **Reboot the VM**: Ensure everything restarts properly and data remains persistent.
4. **High Load Testing**: Use tools to simulate heavy traffic and check for system stability.
5. **Force Shutdowns**: Force stop containers and the VM, then verify data integrity.
6. **Monitor System**: Use logs and monitoring tools to track performance and issues.
7. **Regular Backups**: Set up backups and monitoring to ensure data protection.

Following this protocol will help you confirm that your Outline KM setup on Docker is correctly configured and that your data volumes are truly persistent across various scenarios.
