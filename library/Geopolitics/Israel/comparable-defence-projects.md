The interception of approximately 200 interceptors during the recent **Arrow 2 and Arrow 3** engagement against Iranian missiles targeting Israeli civilian areas is an extraordinary event. While missile defense systems have been employed in various conflicts over the past decade, few instances approach the scale and complexity of **Israel's missile defense systems** operating under sustained attack.

Here are some comparable **large-scale missile interception projects** over the past decade, focusing on missile defense systems used to protect civilian and military targets:

### 1. **Operation Protective Edge (2014) – Israel’s Iron Dome and David's Sling**
   - **Conflict**: During the **2014 Gaza conflict**, known as **Operation Protective Edge**, Hamas and other militant groups in Gaza launched thousands of rockets toward civilian targets in Israel. The **Iron Dome** system intercepted **short-range rockets** fired at cities such as **Tel Aviv**, **Ashdod**, and **Jerusalem**.
   - **Interceptions**: Over the course of the conflict, **Iron Dome** successfully intercepted over **700 rockets**, with a success rate estimated at around **90%**. This large-scale defense against a sustained barrage of rockets over civilian areas is comparable in scale to the recent Iranian missile attack, albeit involving shorter-range rockets rather than ballistic missiles.
   - **Comparable to Arrow 2/3?**: The **Iron Dome** interceptions during Operation Protective Edge were focused on short-range rockets, while **Arrow 2 and 3** are designed for **ballistic missile** threats. However, the scale and intensity of the attacks against civilian areas in Israel make the defense efforts comparable in terms of the sheer volume of interceptions.

### 2. **Saudi Arabia’s Missile Defense Against Houthi Missile Attacks**
   - **Conflict**: Since **2015**, Saudi Arabia has faced a barrage of missile and drone attacks from the **Houthi rebels** in Yemen. The Houthis have fired **short- and medium-range ballistic missiles** (often believed to be supplied by Iran) at military and civilian targets, including the Saudi capital, **Riyadh**, and key infrastructure sites such as **oil refineries**.
   - **Interceptions**: Saudi Arabia relies heavily on **Patriot missile defense systems** to intercept these missile attacks. While there are no official numbers, estimates suggest that Saudi Arabia has intercepted **hundreds of missiles** over the course of the conflict. The **Patriot PAC-3** system has been used to intercept incoming ballistic missiles, particularly over civilian areas like **Riyadh** and **Jeddah**.
   - **Comparable to Arrow 2/3?**: The Patriot PAC-3 operates similarly to **Arrow 2**, intercepting short- and medium-range ballistic missiles. However, the Saudi interceptions are smaller in scale compared to Israel’s recent 200-interceptor event, and Saudi missile defense has occasionally been less successful, with some missiles getting through to hit their targets.

### 3. **North Korean Missile Tests – U.S. and Allied Missile Defense Systems**
   - **Conflict**: North Korea’s repeated ballistic missile tests in recent years have triggered defensive responses from **South Korea**, **Japan**, and the **United States**. As North Korea has tested **long-range ballistic missiles**, including **ICBMs**, missile defense systems such as **THAAD** (Terminal High Altitude Area Defense) and **Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD)** have been deployed to counter potential threats.
   - **Interceptions**: While no direct combat interceptions have taken place between North Korean missiles and U.S. or allied missile defense systems, numerous tests have been conducted to ensure preparedness for large-scale missile attacks. THAAD and Aegis systems in both **South Korea** and **Japan** are on high alert, and their ability to intercept **long-range ballistic missiles** parallels the **Arrow 3** system’s capabilities.
   - **Comparable to Arrow 2/3?**: Although no real-world interceptions have occurred, the threat of North Korean missile attacks has led to large-scale deployment and testing of missile defense systems that are comparable to **Arrow 3** in terms of targeting high-altitude, long-range missiles.

### 4. **India’s Ballistic Missile Defense Program**
   - **Conflict**: India has developed its own **Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) program** to counter potential threats from neighboring adversaries, particularly Pakistan. India’s BMD system consists of two layers: the **Prithvi Air Defense (PAD)** for exo-atmospheric interception and the **Advanced Air Defense (AAD)** for endo-atmospheric interception, somewhat comparable to **Arrow 3** and **Arrow 2**.
   - **Interceptions**: While India has conducted several tests of its BMD system, the program remains in its testing phase, and there have been no large-scale operational deployments or interceptions on the scale of Israel’s recent operations.
   - **Comparable to Arrow 2/3?**: India’s BMD is designed to counter **ballistic missile threats**, much like Arrow 2 and 3. However, India’s system is still in development, and large-scale interceptions have not yet been required in active conflict.

### 5. **Gulf War (1991) – Patriot Interceptions of Iraqi Missiles**
   - **Conflict**: During the **Gulf War (1991)**, Iraq launched **Scud missiles** at Israel and Saudi Arabia. The **U.S. Patriot missile defense system** was deployed to intercept these missiles, primarily over civilian areas in Israel and Saudi Arabia.
   - **Interceptions**: The **Patriot system** intercepted numerous Scud missiles, though its effectiveness was debated at the time. The **large-scale deployment** of missile defense to protect civilian areas is one of the closest historical examples of a missile defense project on the scale of the recent Arrow interceptions.
   - **Comparable to Arrow 2/3?**: The Patriot system used during the Gulf War is a precursor to modern missile defense systems like **Arrow 2**. While not as advanced as today’s systems, it was the first large-scale attempt to defend civilian populations from ballistic missile attacks, setting the stage for the development of systems like Arrow.

### What Makes the Recent Arrow 2 and 3 Interceptions Unique?
The use of **200 interceptors** in a relatively short timeframe is a remarkable feat and represents one of the largest and most intense missile defense operations in recent memory. Several factors make this event stand out:

1. **Multi-Layered Defense System**: Israel’s defense against ballistic missiles relies on a combination of **Arrow 2**, **Arrow 3**, **David’s Sling**, and **Iron Dome**. No other country has deployed such a comprehensive missile defense network, covering everything from **short-range rockets** to **long-range ballistic missiles**.
   
2. **High Volume of Missiles**: The sheer number of interceptors used (around 200) suggests a **massive and coordinated missile attack** from Iran, potentially involving both **ballistic missiles** and **decoys**. Few other missile defense systems have been tested under such conditions.

3. **Accuracy and Precision**: While Saudi Arabia and other countries have faced large numbers of missile threats, **Israel’s success rate** in intercepting missiles (thanks to systems like Arrow and Iron Dome) is among the highest in the world. Many other countries’ systems (e.g., Saudi Patriot) have experienced less consistent success, with missiles sometimes penetrating the defense layers.

### Conclusion: Comparable Interception Projects
Over the past decade, no other missile defense system has faced the exact scale of the Arrow 2 and 3 interception event, where **200 interceptors** were deployed to protect a civilian population from ballistic missile threats. While similar interception projects have taken place, such as Saudi Arabia’s defense against Houthi missile attacks or Israel’s own use of Iron Dome during the 2014 Gaza conflict, **Arrow 2 and 3’s recent success** represents a new milestone in missile defense capabilities.
