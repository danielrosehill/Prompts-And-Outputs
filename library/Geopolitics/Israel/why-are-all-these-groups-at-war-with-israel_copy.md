The conflicts between Israel and these groups—**Palestinian factions**, **Hezbollah**, **Iran**, and the **Houthis**—are driven by a combination of territorial disputes, religious motivations, historical grievances, and regional power dynamics. Each group has its own specific reasons for hostility against Israel, but all share an opposition to Israel’s existence as a state in its current form.

### 1. **Palestinian Factions (Hamas, Islamic Jihad, etc.)**
- **Historical Grievances and Land Disputes**: The root of the conflict lies in the establishment of the state of **Israel in 1948**, which led to the displacement of a large number of Palestinian Arabs, often referred to as the **Nakba** (Catastrophe). Palestinian factions, including **Hamas** and **Islamic Jihad**, do not recognize Israel’s right to exist and are committed to the establishment of a Palestinian state covering the entire territory of historic Palestine.
- **Occupation of Territories**: Since **1967**, Israel has occupied the **West Bank** and **Gaza Strip**, which Palestinians view as the foundation for their future state. The continued settlement building, military presence in the West Bank, and blockade of Gaza have fueled the hostility of Palestinian groups.
- **Religious Ideology**: **Hamas** is an Islamist movement that believes in the religious duty of resisting the occupation. Hamas’s charter calls for jihad to liberate all of Palestine. The **Al-Aqsa Mosque** in Jerusalem, one of Islam’s holiest sites, also plays a crucial role in motivating many Palestinians to resist Israeli control over the city.

### 2. **Hezbollah**
- **Support for Palestine**: **Hezbollah** was formed in the early 1980s in response to Israel’s invasion of **Lebanon** in 1982. Hezbollah sees itself as part of the broader resistance against Israel, aligning with Palestinian groups in their struggle. Hezbollah’s leaders have repeatedly stated their objective of ending the Israeli occupation and supporting Palestinian sovereignty.
- **Lebanese Territorial Claims**: Hezbollah has territorial grievances, primarily over the **Shebaa Farms**, a small strip of land occupied by Israel but claimed by Lebanon. Although Israel withdrew from most of Lebanon in 2000, Hezbollah insists that Shebaa Farms is still occupied Lebanese territory, thus justifying its continued military actions against Israel.
- **Iranian Influence**: Hezbollah is heavily supported by **Iran** in terms of funding, weapons, and training. It serves as an extension of Iran’s influence in the Levant, and its animosity toward Israel also aligns with Iranian goals to counteract Israeli and Western influence in the region.

### 3. **Iran**
- **Religious and Ideological Opposition**: **Iran** does not recognize the legitimacy of Israel and has consistently called for its dismantling. Since the 1979 **Islamic Revolution**, Iran has promoted the idea of liberating Palestine as a central tenet of its foreign policy. Iranian leaders often describe Israel as the “**Zionist regime**” and view its existence as incompatible with regional stability and Islamic values.
- **Regional Power Struggle**: Iran sees Israel as an extension of Western power in the Middle East, primarily due to Israel’s close alliance with the **United States**. Iran views itself as the leader of the “**Axis of Resistance**,” which also includes Hezbollah, Palestinian groups, and the Syrian government, all of whom oppose Western and Israeli influence in the region. The rivalry between **Sunni Arab states** and Iran, which has intensified over recent years, also contributes to Iran’s continued enmity towards Israel, as support for Palestinian resistance offers Iran an opportunity to bolster its influence.
- **Nuclear Program and Defense**: Israel has repeatedly targeted Iranian assets in Syria and has opposed Iran’s **nuclear program**, which it views as a direct threat. This has exacerbated hostility and led to a consistent Iranian policy of supporting anti-Israel armed groups as a deterrent against any Israeli action.

### 4. **Houthis (Ansar Allah)**
- **Solidarity with the Palestinian Cause**: The **Houthis**, based in Yemen, see themselves as part of the broader resistance axis against Israel and the United States. Although the Houthis have little direct involvement in fighting Israel, their leadership frequently echoes the rhetoric of Hezbollah and Iran, describing Israel as an illegitimate occupier and expressing solidarity with the Palestinian cause.
- **Iranian Backing**: The Houthis receive support from **Iran**, both ideologically and materially. As a Shia group in Yemen, they align with Iran’s broader regional strategy to create a front against Israel and Saudi Arabia. Their animosity toward Israel is driven by this relationship, and they have declared readiness to engage against Israel should a wider regional war break out.

### Summary of Motivations:
- **Palestinian Factions**: Driven by historical grievances, displacement, and religious motivations; they seek a Palestinian state and the end of Israeli occupation.
- **Hezbollah**: Motivated by territorial claims, anti-Israel resistance ideology, and Iranian influence; seeks to liberate occupied lands and support Palestinians.
- **Iran**: Driven by ideological opposition to Israel’s existence, anti-Western sentiment, and regional power ambitions; seeks to limit Israeli influence and challenge U.S. allies.
- **Houthis**: Inspired by solidarity with Palestinians and Iranian influence; view Israel as an illegitimate power in the region.

These groups, each with distinct motivations and regional dynamics, share a common adversarial stance towards Israel, often rooted in a mix of religious, ideological, historical, and geopolitical factors. Iran’s influence is particularly significant, as it helps drive the alignment of these groups against Israel in pursuit of Tehran’s regional ambitions.
