# Output

Israel is currently engaged in a multi-front conflict, with active fighting against several groups across different fronts. Here's a breakdown of the main fronts and the groups involved:

### 1. **Gaza Front**
   - **Group:** **Hamas** and **Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ)**
   - **Conflict:** The Gaza Strip, controlled by Hamas, is a major front in the conflict. Hamas initiated a large-scale attack on Israel, including rocket fire, ground incursions, and terrorist attacks, prompting Israel to respond with airstrikes and a ground offensive.

### 2. **Northern Front (Lebanon and Syria)**
   - **Group:** **Hezbollah** (Lebanon-based) and **Syrian-based militias**
   - **Conflict:** In the north, Hezbollah, a powerful Iranian-backed militia in Lebanon, has exchanged rocket and missile fire with Israel. There are also concerns about Iranian proxy militias operating from Syria, contributing to a possible northern escalation.

### 3. **West Bank (Judea and Samaria)**
   - **Groups:** **Various Palestinian militant groups** (some affiliated with Hamas, PIJ, and other factions)
   - **Conflict:** In the West Bank, there has been an increase in attacks on Israeli civilians and military personnel. Israel has been conducting raids and operations to suppress militant activities.

### 4. **Israeli Domestic Front**
   - **Groups:** **Arab-Israeli extremists** and **Palestinian factions**
   - **Conflict:** Within Israel, there have been internal unrest and violence between Jewish and Arab communities in mixed cities. Some Arab-Israeli extremists have aligned with Palestinian factions, leading to clashes with Israeli security forces and civilians.

### 5. **International Front (Cyber and Diplomacy)**
   - **Groups:** **Iranian cyber groups** and **Global Islamist networks**
   - **Conflict:** In addition to physical fronts, Israel is engaged in cyber warfare, particularly with Iran and Iranian proxies, as well as countering international diplomatic pressure and disinformation campaigns from various Islamist networks supporting the anti-Israel coalition.

These fronts represent the complexity of Israel's current war, involving a range of groups with differing capabilities, from well-armed militias like Hezbollah to smaller, localized factions across the region.
