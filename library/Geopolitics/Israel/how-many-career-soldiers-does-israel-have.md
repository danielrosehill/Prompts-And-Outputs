As of recent estimates, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has approximately **170,000 active-duty personnel**, including both full-time career soldiers and conscripts. The breakdown across different branches is approximately as follows:

### 1. **Army (Ground Forces)**
   - **Active Personnel**: Around **130,000**
   - The largest branch of the IDF, consisting of infantry, armor, artillery, and engineering units. This also includes elite units (e.g., Sayeret Matkal, Duvdevan) and specialized brigades. Many career soldiers are concentrated here, particularly in command, intelligence, and technical roles.

### 2. **Air Force (IAF)**
   - **Active Personnel**: Around **34,000**
   - The Israeli Air Force is a highly professional and technical branch, with a significant number of career pilots, technicians, and support staff. The IAF's personnel structure includes fighter pilots, UAV operators, air defense units, and maintenance crews.

### 3. **Navy**
   - **Active Personnel**: Around **10,000**
   - Although smaller in size, the Navy is a critical component of Israel's defense, especially for coastal and maritime security. It includes career officers who serve on missile boats, submarines, and in naval commando units (e.g., Shayetet 13).

### 4. **Intelligence Corps**
   - While specific numbers are classified, a **significant portion** of career soldiers are involved in the **Intelligence Corps**, including units like **Unit 8200** (signals intelligence), which plays a key role in cyber operations, electronic warfare, and intelligence gathering.

### Composition of Full-Time Career Soldiers
- **Career Professionals**: Of the approximately 170,000 active-duty personnel, a significant portion are career professionals (officers, NCOs, and technical staff). The **exact number of career soldiers** (as opposed to conscripts) is harder to specify publicly, but estimates suggest there are around **30,000 - 40,000** career soldiers across the IDF. These include high-ranking officers, pilots, naval officers, and long-term service members in technical, logistics, and intelligence roles.

### Reservists
- In addition to the active-duty forces, Israel relies heavily on its **reservist system**, which can mobilize around **465,000** trained personnel when needed. Many reservists have previous career experience or specialized training, allowing the IDF to scale up rapidly during conflicts.

These numbers offer a general sense of the structure of Israel's military forces, with a professional core of career soldiers supplemented by conscripts and a large, capable reserve force.
