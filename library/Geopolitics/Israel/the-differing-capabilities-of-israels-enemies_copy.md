# Prompt

Summarise the capabilities of the Palestinian factions, Hizbullah, Iran, and the Houthis. All from the perspective of the weapons they have at their disposal to use against Israel

# Output

Here's a summary of the **capabilities of Palestinian factions, Hezbollah, Iran, and the Houthis**, specifically from the perspective of the weapons they have at their disposal to use against Israel:

### **1. Palestinian Factions** (Hamas and Islamic Jihad)
- **Rocket Arsenal**: The primary offensive capability of Hamas and Islamic Jihad is their **rockets**, which range from crude, homemade short-range rockets like **Qassams** to more advanced systems supplied by Iran such as **Fajr-5** rockets, which have a range of about 75 km, allowing them to target central Israel, including Tel Aviv.
- **Anti-Tank Missiles**: Both factions have a range of **anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs)**, such as the **Kornet**, which they have used against Israeli armored vehicles.
- **Drones**: Hamas has developed and used **drones** for reconnaissance and offensive operations. These drones have limited payloads and are not as sophisticated as those used by Hezbollah or Iran.
- **Tunnels**: Another significant tool is the use of **tunnels** to smuggle weapons into Gaza and conduct cross-border attacks. These tunnels provide a strategic way to bypass Israeli defenses.

### **2. Hezbollah**
- **Rockets and Missiles**:
  - Hezbollah has around **130,000 to 150,000 rockets** of various ranges. Their arsenal includes **Katyusha** rockets for short-range attacks, **Fajr-5**, **Khaibar-1**, **Zelzal-1 and Zelzal-2**, and **Fateh-110/M-600** missiles. These missiles range from shorter-range projectiles to more advanced systems capable of reaching most parts of Israel.
  - **Zelzal** missiles have a range of up to 210 km, and the **Fateh-110** can reach up to 300 km with precision targeting capabilities, posing a significant threat to critical infrastructure in Israel【105†source】.
- **Drones**: Hezbollah operates a range of **Iranian-supplied drones**, including **Shahed-136** attack drones and other reconnaissance UAVs. These drones are capable of carrying payloads and conducting targeted attacks at distances up to 1,700 km, providing a substantial capability for both surveillance and offense【102†source】【103†source】.
- **Anti-Aircraft and Anti-Ship Missiles**: Hezbollah possesses **Yakhont** and **Silkworm** anti-ship missiles that can target naval vessels. They also have **surface-to-air missiles**, capable of targeting Israeli drones and low-flying aircraft【103†source】.

### **3. Iran**
- **Ballistic Missiles**: Iran has the most sophisticated missile arsenal of all these actors. It includes **short- to medium-range ballistic missiles** such as the **Shahab** and **Khorramshahr** families, capable of reaching targets up to 2,000 km away. This gives Iran the ability to strike anywhere within Israel from its own territory.
- **Cruise Missiles and Long-Range Ballistic Missiles**: The **Qiam-1** and **Zolfaghar** are ballistic missiles with ranges of up to 800 km. They also have advanced cruise missile capabilities like the **Soumar**.
- **Drones**: Iran has an extensive fleet of drones, including **Shahed-129** and **Shahed-136** models, which are capable of long-range reconnaissance and targeted attacks. These drones have been deployed by Iran’s proxies and are seen as a key tool for Iran’s asymmetric warfare strategy.
- **Naval Assets**: Iran also has a range of **anti-ship cruise missiles** that could target Israeli assets in the Persian Gulf or potentially be transferred to Hezbollah or other proxies.

### **4. Houthis (Ansar Allah)**
- **Missiles and Drones**: The Houthis have received significant support from Iran, particularly in the form of **ballistic missiles** and **drones**. They have used **Quds-1** cruise missiles and **Badr** series ballistic missiles. These capabilities have mostly been used against targets in Saudi Arabia and the UAE but could theoretically be used against Israeli targets if deployed strategically.
- **Long-Range Drones**: The Houthis have developed an advanced **drone capability** with Iran’s help, which has been used to strike Saudi infrastructure. These drones include **Samad-3**, with a range capable of reaching over 1,500 km, potentially threatening Israeli interests in the region.
- **Naval Mines and Anti-Ship Missiles**: The Houthis also have **anti-ship missiles** and **naval mines** capable of disrupting maritime activity, particularly in the Red Sea, which could affect Israeli maritime trade routes.

### **Comparative Summary**:
- **Palestinian Factions** rely mostly on short- to medium-range rockets and limited drone capabilities for their operations against Israel.
- **Hezbollah** is significantly more powerful, with a vast arsenal of rockets and missiles (up to 300 km range), sophisticated anti-ship and anti-aircraft weapons, and long-range attack drones.
- **Iran** holds the most advanced and diverse capabilities, with a comprehensive missile program, including medium-range ballistic missiles that can directly threaten Israel, and drones capable of carrying out long-range precision strikes.
- **Houthis**, while primarily focused on their conflict in Yemen, possess Iranian-supplied ballistic missiles and drones that could potentially be redirected against Israel if Iran wished to escalate tensions.

This distribution of weapons illustrates the strategic depth of Iran’s regional influence through its proxies. Each of these groups has been armed and trained by Iran to effectively target Israel in different ways, depending on their geographic positioning and operational role.
