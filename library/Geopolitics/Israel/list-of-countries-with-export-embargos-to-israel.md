There is no comprehensive, single database that globally tracks all export embargos against Israel, but multiple countries have recently imposed arms embargoes or restrictions on military exports to Israel, particularly in response to its military operations in Gaza.

Several countries, including **Italy**, **Belgium**, **Spain**, and **Turkey**, have halted or restricted arms sales to Israel in 2024, citing concerns about potential violations of international humanitarian law due to the conflict. Additionally, the **European Union** has encouraged its member states to limit arms sales to Israel【108†source】【110†source】【112†source】. The **United States**, while Israel's primary weapons supplier, has delayed or slowed certain shipments of precision-guided bombs【111†source】.

To track export restrictions or embargos globally, you would typically need to consult a combination of resources, such as the **United Nations Arms Embargo Database** or **sanction databases** managed by organizations like **OFAC** (Office of Foreign Assets Control), which track various export controls and restrictions, including arms sales. These resources can offer insights into which countries are imposing restrictions and the legal framework behind these decisions.
