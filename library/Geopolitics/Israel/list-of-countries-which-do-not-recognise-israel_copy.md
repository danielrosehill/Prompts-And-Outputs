2. **Egypt** – Recognized Israel under the **Camp David Accords** in 1979, though relations remain fragile due to public sentiment.
3. **Jordan** – Signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994, maintaining diplomatic relations, but there are tensions due to regional politics and the Palestinian issue.

6. **Qatar** – Has unofficial trade and diplomatic ties with Israel, but no formal recognition.
7. **Turkey** – Recognized Israel in 1949 and maintains diplomatic relations, but relations have been strained since 2010 due to the Gaza conflict.

### **Countries with Recent Normalization Efforts (Abraham Accords)**
Several countries have recently established or restored diplomatic relations with Israel under the **Abraham Accords**, though full recognition is still being implemented in stages in some cases:
1. **United Arab Emirates** – Normalized relations in 2020 under the Abraham Accords.
2. **Bahrain** – Normalized relations in 2020.
3. **Morocco** – Restored relations in 2020.
4. **Sudan** – Agreed to normalize relations in 2020, but full recognition is still being processed.

### **Notes on Partial Recognition and Frozen Relations**
- Some of these countries, such as **Qatar** and **Oman**, maintain unofficial or behind-the-scenes diplomatic ties or engage in trade with Israel without full formal recognition.
- Several countries, such as **Turkey** and **Egypt**, have full recognition but experience strained or complex diplomatic relationships due to regional conflicts and the broader Middle Eastern political landscape.

### **Countries with No Diplomatic Relations**
- **Syria**, **Lebanon**, and other nations neighboring Israel remain in a state of war with Israel, making formal recognition impossible.
- **North Korea** and **Pakistan** are among non-Arab countries that refuse to recognize Israel, often citing solidarity with Palestine as the reason for their position.

This list outlines the diplomatic status between Israel and various countries around the world, primarily influenced by the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict and regional politics.
