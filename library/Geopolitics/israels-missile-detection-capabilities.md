Yes, Israel is highly likely to detect the launch of Iranian missiles in real-time, thanks to its advanced multi-layered defense systems and close cooperation with global allies. Here's how Israel achieves this:

### 1. **Early Warning Systems**

\- **Radar Networks:** Israel operates a sophisticated network of ground-based and airborne radar systems designed to detect missile launches. These radars are capable of tracking the trajectory of incoming missiles from the moment they are launched, providing early warning of an attack. Key radar systems include:

\- **Green Pine Radar:** A long-range radar system used as part of Israel's Arrow missile defense system, capable of detecting and tracking ballistic missiles at ranges of up to 500 kilometers.

\- **Super Green Pine:** An upgraded version of the Green Pine radar, offering enhanced detection capabilities over longer distances and with greater precision.

\- **X-Band Radar:** A U.S.-provided radar system deployed in Israel, capable of detecting and tracking missile launches from hundreds of kilometers away, even from deep within Iran.

### 2. **Satellite Surveillance**

\- **Reconnaissance Satellites:** Israel operates its own reconnaissance satellites, such as the Ofek series, which provide real-time imagery and intelligence on activities within enemy territories. These satellites can detect missile launch preparations and actual launches.

\- **Collaborative Satellite Networks:** Israel also benefits from intelligence sharing with the United States and other allies, including data from global satellite networks like the U.S. Defense Support Program (DSP) and Space-Based Infrared System (SBIRS), which can detect the infrared signature of missile launches from space.

### 3. **Missile Defense Systems**

\- **Arrow Missile Defense System:** Israel's Arrow system is designed specifically to intercept and destroy ballistic missiles at high altitudes and long ranges. The system is integrated with early warning radars and can react quickly to incoming threats.

\- **Arrow-2 and Arrow-3:** These interceptors are capable of engaging missiles at various stages of their flight, including outside the Earth's atmosphere (exo-atmospheric interception).

\- **David's Sling:** A medium- to long-range missile defense system designed to intercept missiles with ranges of 40 to 300 kilometers. It complements the Arrow system and can target threats like cruise missiles and large rockets.

\- **Iron Dome:** While primarily known for intercepting short-range rockets, the Iron Dome system also plays a role in defending against larger threats by providing real-time data to other defense systems and intercepting smaller threats that might be part of a larger missile attack.

### 4. **Intelligence Sharing and Cooperation**

\- **U.S.-Israel Defense Collaboration:** Israel maintains close cooperation with the United States in missile defense, intelligence sharing, and technological development. This collaboration enhances Israel's ability to detect and respond to missile threats in real-time. The integration of U.S. early warning systems, such as those provided by the SBIRS, with Israeli defense infrastructure, significantly boosts Israel's detection capabilities.

\- **Allied Intelligence:** Israel is part of a broader intelligence network that includes cooperation with European and regional allies. This network allows for real-time sharing of satellite data, radar information, and other intelligence related to missile launches.

### 5. **Signal and Electronic Intelligence (SIGINT/ELINT)**

\- **Electronic Surveillance:** Israel uses advanced SIGINT and ELINT systems to monitor communications, radar emissions, and other electronic signals from Iran. These systems can provide indications of an impending missile launch, such as changes in communication patterns, radar activity, and missile fueling operations.

\- **Cyber Intelligence:** Israel's capabilities in cyber intelligence also allow it to monitor and potentially disrupt Iranian missile launch systems. This includes infiltrating communication networks, radar systems, and even command and control systems that might be involved in a missile launch.

### 6. **Aerial and Ground Reconnaissance**

\- **Drones and Aircraft:** Israel operates a fleet of drones and reconnaissance aircraft that can monitor Iranian missile sites and provide real-time intelligence. These assets can detect missile preparations, such as the movement of missiles to launch sites or the activation of radar systems associated with missile launches.

\- **Human Intelligence (HUMINT):** Israelâ€™s intelligence agencies, particularly the Mossad, are known for their HUMINT capabilities, which include networks of informants and covert operations that can provide real-time intelligence on Iranian military activities, including missile launches.

### Conclusion

Israel's ability to detect missile launches in real-time is underpinned by a combination of advanced radar systems, satellite surveillance, intelligence sharing with allies, missile defense systems, and sophisticated SIGINT and HUMINT capabilities. This comprehensive approach allows Israel to not only detect missile launches as they happen but also to respond rapidly, whether through interception, pre-emptive strikes, or other defensive measures.
