The regional divisions and organizational structures used by intelligence agencies, foreign affairs departments, and geopolitical analysts are often referred to by various names, but there isn't a single **formal, universally recognized term** for the entire list. However, depending on the context, these types of divisions are often referred to by the following terms:

### **1. Regional Desks or Divisions**
   - **"Regional Desks"** or **"Geopolitical Desks"** are the most common terms used within foreign ministries, embassies, and intelligence agencies to refer to the teams or offices assigned to specific global regions. 
   - Example: "Middle East Desk," "East Asia Desk," "Africa Desk."

### **2. Geographic Divisions**
   - **"Geographic Divisions"** is another term that might be used to refer to the overarching organizational breakdown of the world into regions based on geopolitical, strategic, or cultural considerations.
   - Example: "Europe Division," "Asia Division."

### **3. Country Desks**
   - When agencies or organizations focus on individual countries of high strategic interest (such as Russia, China, or North Korea), they often use the term **"Country Desks"** to designate the teams working on specific nations.
   - Example: "China Desk," "Russia Desk."

### **4. Geographic Bureaus**
   - In the context of **diplomatic services** and **foreign ministries**, regions might be managed under **"Geographic Bureaus"** or **"Geopolitical Bureaus."**
   - Example: "Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs" (U.S. State Department).

### **5. Regional Commands**
   - In **military intelligence** and **defense organizations**, such as the U.S. Department of Defense, the world is divided into **Unified Combatant Commands**, each responsible for different geographic areas. These are often referred to as **"Regional Commands."**
   - Example: "U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM)," "U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM)."

### **6. Intelligence Areas of Responsibility**
   - **"Areas of Responsibility" (AOR)** is another term used by intelligence agencies and military organizations, which often define geographic or functional areas where they focus their resources.
   - Example: "Middle East Area of Responsibility."

### **7. Regional Clusters**
   - **"Regional Clusters"** is a term sometimes used in international organizations, NGOs, and multilateral institutions (like the UN or World Bank) to refer to specific groupings of countries based on geography, culture, or economic similarities.
   - Example: "Latin America and the Caribbean Cluster."

### Examples of Official Naming Conventions in Practice:
1. **U.S. State Department** uses the term **"Bureaus"**, such as:
   - "Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs"
   - "Bureau of African Affairs"
   - "Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs"

2. **U.S. Department of Defense** uses **"Combatant Commands"**, such as:
   - "United States Central Command (CENTCOM)" (Middle East, Egypt, Central Asia)
   - "United States Indo-Pacific Command (INDOPACOM)" (East Asia, Southeast Asia)

3. **European Union External Action Service (EEAS)**:
   - Uses terms like **"Regional Divisions"** and **"Geographic Departments"** to organize its diplomatic missions and foreign relations.

### Summary
While there's no single **formal name** universally applied to the list of regional divisions across intelligence and foreign affairs sectors, terms like **"Regional Desks," "Geopolitical Desks," "Geographic Divisions,"** or **"Areas of Responsibility (AOR)"** are commonly used. The naming conventions vary by organization, but all serve the purpose of dividing the world into manageable areas for strategic and geopolitical analysis.
