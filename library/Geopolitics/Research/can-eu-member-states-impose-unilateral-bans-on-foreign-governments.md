Yes, EU member states can unilaterally impose bans on specific individuals, including officials from foreign governments, under their national laws. However, these bans typically must align with broader EU regulations and policies. Each member state has its own legal framework to determine how and when it can enforce such bans, often influenced by international law, human rights considerations, and diplomatic relations.

### Key Points:

1. **National Sovereignty**: EU member states retain sovereignty over their immigration policies and can decide whom to allow entry or deny entry based on national interests. This means they can ban specific individuals without needing EU-wide consensus【71†source】【72†source】.

2. **Alignment with EU Law**: While individual countries can impose bans, these actions are often guided by EU laws and policies, especially regarding human rights and international relations. For instance, a member state might justify a ban based on human rights abuses or violations of international law【72†source】【71†source】.

3. **Collaborative Measures**: If a member state wishes to implement broader sanctions or entry bans that affect multiple countries or categories of individuals, it often requires cooperation or agreement at the EU level. This can involve discussions in the Council of the European Union, where member states can agree on collective actions against certain regimes or individuals【71†source】【72†source】.

4. **Precedents and Examples**: Recent discussions, such as Belgium's proposed ban on extremist Israeli settlers, illustrate how a member state can take unilateral action while also pushing for broader EU involvement in similar measures【72†source】.
