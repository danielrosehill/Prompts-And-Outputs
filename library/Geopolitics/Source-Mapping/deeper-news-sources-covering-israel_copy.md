# Prompt

I'm looking for a news source and thought you might have some advice. I would love to get a very focused and curated daily news briefing about geopolitical developments in Israel. I would like a source that focuses on key military and intelligence analyses, perhaps going a little bit deeper than the mainstream news and avoiding speculation. Perhaps OSINT might be integrated also. Can you think of any such sources?

# Output

Based on your requirements for a focused, curated daily news briefing on geopolitical developments in Israel with an emphasis on military and intelligence analyses, I would recommend considering the following sources:

1. Israel Defense (www.israeldefense.co.il/en)
This website provides in-depth coverage of Israeli defense and security matters, including military operations, intelligence analyses, and technological developments[8]. It offers a mix of news articles, expert opinions, and analysis that goes beyond mainstream reporting.

2. Curated Intelligence (www.curatedintel.org)
While not exclusively focused on Israel, this community of analysts tracks global threat landscapes, including cyber activities related to conflicts involving Israel[6]. They provide OSINT-integrated analyses and updates on hacktivist, cybercriminal, and APT group activities.

3. Geopolitical Futures (geopoliticalfutures.com)
This source offers daily memos and in-depth geopolitical analyses, including regular updates on Israel and the broader Middle East[7]. Their focus on forecasting and intelligence-style analysis aligns well with your interests.

4. IDF Military Intelligence Directorate Updates
While not a daily briefing, the IDF's Military Intelligence Directorate occasionally releases public information that could be valuable for understanding the Israeli perspective on security matters[4].

5. Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) (www.csis.org)
CSIS provides regular analyses on Middle East security issues, including detailed reports on Israeli intelligence and military operations[5]. While not a daily briefing, their reports offer deep insights into geopolitical developments.

To get a comprehensive picture, you might consider combining these sources or setting up alerts for Israel-related content from them. Keep in mind that while these sources aim for accuracy, it's always beneficial to cross-reference information from multiple reputable sources for a well-rounded understanding of complex geopolitical situations.
