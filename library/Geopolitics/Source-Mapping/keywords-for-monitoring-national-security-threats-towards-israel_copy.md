- **Combine** the keywords with logical operators like `AND` or `OR` to fine-tune your queries and reduce false positives. For instance:
  - **"Iran AND missile attack AND Israel"**

  - **"Rocket sirens AND Israel"**

### Event Detection and Prioritization:
- **Level 5 (Most Severe)**: Keywords that include **missile attacks, airstrikes, or nuclear threats** should trigger **immediate alerts**, as they represent high-casualty risks.

- **Level 3**: Keywords involving **cyberattacks, drone attacks, or threats to critical infrastructure** should also be flagged but monitored closely for further developments.

This list should help you effectively monitor major national threats against Israel, enabling you to detect **escalations** from adversaries like **Iran** or **Hezbollah** in real time.
