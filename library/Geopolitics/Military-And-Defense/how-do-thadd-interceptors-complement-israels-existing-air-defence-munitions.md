The **Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD)** system, recently supplied to Israel by the United States, is a high-performance missile defense system designed to intercept ballistic missiles during their terminal phase (just before impact). Here’s a comparison between **THAAD** and the interceptors already in Israel’s inventory, such as those from the **Arrow**, **Iron Dome**, and **David's Sling** systems:

### 1. **THAAD (Terminal High Altitude Area Defense)**
   - **Purpose**: THAAD is designed to intercept short, medium, and intermediate-range ballistic missiles during the terminal phase (the final phase of their trajectory as they re-enter the atmosphere).
   - **Interceptor Type**: THAAD uses hit-to-kill interceptors, meaning they destroy incoming missiles by directly colliding with them, relying on kinetic energy rather than an explosive warhead.
   - **Altitude & Range**:
     - **Altitude**: THAAD intercepts missiles at **very high altitudes**, up to **150 km** (93 miles), potentially intercepting threats both inside and outside the Earth's atmosphere.
     - **Range**: Around **200 km** (124 miles).
   - **Manufacturers**: Developed by **Lockheed Martin**.
   - **Unique Features**:
     - Specifically designed to counter threats at high altitudes.
     - **No explosive warhead**, it relies solely on kinetic energy to neutralize threats.
     - Highly mobile and deployable quickly.

### 2. **Arrow 2 and Arrow 3**
   - **Purpose**: The **Arrow system** is Israel’s main long-range missile defense system, designed to intercept ballistic missiles during both their mid-course (in space) and terminal phase.
     - **Arrow 2**: Targets ballistic missiles in the upper atmosphere.
     - **Arrow 3**: Targets ballistic missiles in **outer space** during their mid-course phase, even further out than THAAD.
   - **Interceptor Type**: Both Arrow 2 and Arrow 3 use hit-to-kill technology, like THAAD, but Arrow 3 is specifically designed for **exo-atmospheric** interceptions (outside the Earth’s atmosphere).
   - **Altitude & Range**:
     - **Arrow 2**: Up to 50-60 km (31-37 miles) altitude.
     - **Arrow 3**: Up to 100-150 km (62-93 miles) altitude (similar to THAAD).
   - **Manufacturers**: Developed by **Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI)** in cooperation with the **U.S. Missile Defense Agency** and **Boeing**.
   - **Unique Features**:
     - **Arrow 3** provides interception at greater ranges, further out into space.
     - Arrow’s combination of mid-course and terminal interception provides layered defense.
   
### 3. **David's Sling (Stunner Interceptor)**
   - **Purpose**: Designed to intercept **medium- to long-range** missiles and rockets, David's Sling is positioned between Iron Dome (for short-range threats) and the Arrow system.
   - **Interceptor Type**: The **Stunner interceptor** is a multi-stage missile designed to engage a wide range of targets, including aircraft, cruise missiles, and long-range rockets.
   - **Altitude & Range**:
     - **Altitude**: Lower than THAAD and Arrow 3, but higher than Iron Dome.
     - **Range**: Around 300 km (186 miles), offering coverage over a broad region.
   - **Manufacturers**: **Rafael Advanced Defense Systems** in partnership with **Raytheon**.
   - **Unique Features**:
     - Provides **mid-layer defense** against medium-range threats.
     - Uses a combination of radar and infrared guidance for highly accurate interception.
   
### 4. **Iron Dome (Tamir Interceptor)**
   - **Purpose**: Iron Dome is designed to intercept **short-range rockets, artillery shells, and mortars**. It offers point defense for populated areas, defending against threats at very low altitudes.
   - **Interceptor Type**: **Tamir interceptor** uses explosive warheads to destroy incoming threats in low to mid-altitude ranges.
   - **Altitude & Range**:
     - **Altitude**: Very low compared to THAAD and Arrow, specifically targeting threats in the lower atmosphere.
     - **Range**: Around 70 km (43 miles).
   - **Manufacturers**: **Rafael Advanced Defense Systems**, in collaboration with **Raytheon**.
   - **Unique Features**:
     - Excellent for short-range threats, but not designed for high-altitude intercepts like THAAD.

### Comparison Overview:

| **System**        | **Purpose**                                  | **Interceptor Type**      | **Altitude**              | **Range**              | **Manufacturers**                                       |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **THAAD**         | Intercept ballistic missiles in terminal phase| Hit-to-kill                | Up to 150 km (93 miles)    | 200 km (124 miles)     | **Lockheed Martin**                                     |
| **Arrow 2**       | Intercept ballistic missiles (upper atmosphere) | Hit-to-kill                | 50-60 km (31-37 miles)     | Medium                 | **Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI), Boeing**           |
| **Arrow 3**       | Intercept ballistic missiles (exo-atmosphere) | Hit-to-kill                | Up to 150 km (93 miles)    | Medium to Long          | **Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI), Boeing**           |
| **David's Sling** | Intercept medium- to long-range missiles      | Multi-stage (Stunner)      | Medium                     | 300 km (186 miles)      | **Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, Raytheon**           |
| **Iron Dome**     | Intercept short-range rockets, mortars        | Explosive warhead (Tamir)  | Very low                   | 70 km (43 miles)        | **Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, Raytheon**           |

### Key Differences:
- **Altitude**: THAAD and Arrow 3 both operate at very high altitudes (up to 150 km), with Arrow 3 specializing in space interceptions. THAAD focuses on the terminal phase, while Arrow 3 can target missiles in mid-course and terminal phases.
- **Range**: THAAD and Arrow 3 are similar in altitude and interception distance, though David's Sling offers greater regional coverage with its 300 km range.
- **Purpose**: THAAD is comparable to the Arrow system, but the **Arrow 3** provides broader capabilities by operating in space, while **THAAD** focuses exclusively on high-altitude, terminal-phase interceptions.

In conclusion, **THAAD** complements Israel’s existing missile defense systems by adding another layer of high-altitude, terminal-phase defense, but **Arrow 3** remains the most capable system for **exo-atmospheric** interception, particularly in the mid-course phase.
