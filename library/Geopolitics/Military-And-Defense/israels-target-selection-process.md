Israel's process for identifying targets in such strikes typically involves extensive intelligence gathering, strategic planning, and precision in munitions selection:

1. Intelligence Gathering: Israel relies on multiple intelligence sources to identify potential targets. This includes satellite imagery, signals intelligence (SIGINT), human intelligence (HUMINT), and reconnaissance from drones or aircraft. The Mossad (Israel’s external intelligence agency) and AMAN (military intelligence) likely play key roles in gathering data on Iranian facilities, their locations, and operations. Cooperation with other nations' intelligence agencies may also provide additional insights.


2. Target Analysis: Once potential targets are identified, they undergo a detailed analysis to determine their strategic value. For example, facilities involved in missile production, drone technology, or housing key military personnel might be prioritized. Intelligence analysts assess the potential impact of disabling or destroying these targets, and the degree of risk involved in striking them.


3. Operational Planning: Israel's military (IDF) then plans the logistics of the strike. This includes deciding on the timing, routes for aircraft to avoid detection, and methods to minimize risks to pilots. Planners consider factors like air defense systems, the presence of non-combatants, and the need for surprise to ensure the mission's success.


4. Selection of Munitions: The choice of munitions is critical. Israel might use precision-guided missiles to ensure accuracy and limit collateral damage. Munitions are chosen based on the target's characteristics—bunker-buster bombs for underground facilities, or smaller, guided bombs for above-ground, high-value targets. The IDF’s experience with precision strikes enables them to carry out targeted operations with minimal collateral damage, which is crucial for minimizing international backlash.


5. Real-time Monitoring and Adjustments: During the operation, Israel often uses real-time surveillance to monitor the strike and ensure its success. UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) or aircraft might provide live video feeds, allowing commanders to make quick adjustments if necessary, such as aborting a strike if new risks emerge.



Israel's strategic planning and advanced military capabilities, along with its extensive intelligence network, allow it to conduct complex operations with a high degree of precision. This meticulous approach aims to achieve strategic objectives while minimizing unintended consequences and escalation risks.
