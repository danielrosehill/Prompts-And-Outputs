To carry out strikes against **Tehran**, the **Israeli Defense Forces (IDF)** would have to evade multiple layers of Iran's highly capable air defense systems. Tehran, being the capital and a critical hub for Iran’s political and military infrastructure, is heavily protected by a sophisticated **integrated air defense network (IADS)** that includes a mix of both **indigenous** and **imported systems**. The air defenses in place in and around Tehran are among the best that Iran can offer, and an IDF strike would have to consider evading several major types of air defenses:

### 1. **Long-Range Surface-to-Air Missiles (SAM) Systems**
- **S-300PMU-2** (NATO reporting name: SA-20 Gargoyle):
  - This system, provided by Russia, is one of Iran’s most advanced air defense assets. The **S-300** is capable of engaging aircraft, cruise missiles, and ballistic missiles at ranges of up to **150-200 kilometers**.
  - The S-300 employs sophisticated **phased array radar**, making it effective against a wide range of aerial targets, including low-flying aircraft or those employing countermeasures.
  
- **Bavar-373**:
  - This is an indigenous Iranian system modeled after the S-300. It is a long-range SAM system with an estimated range of up to **200 kilometers**, designed to intercept advanced aerial threats.
  - It uses multiple radars and missiles to engage aircraft, UAVs, and even ballistic threats, presenting a significant challenge for any attacking aircraft.

### 2. **Medium-Range SAM Systems**
- **Mersad System**:
  - An Iranian indigenous system based on the American **MIM-23 Hawk**. It has a medium-range capability and can target high-speed aircraft. The **Mersad** is often deployed in coordination with other air defenses to provide a layered approach to aerial defense.
  
- **Khordad-3**:
  - Known for its role in shooting down a U.S. RQ-4A Global Hawk drone in 2019, the **Khordad-3** is an indigenous mobile SAM system capable of targeting aircraft, cruise missiles, and drones at ranges of up to **50-75 kilometers**.

- **Raad** (Thunder):
  - The **Raad** system is another medium-range SAM developed by Iran. It is designed to counter aircraft and missiles at lower altitudes and ranges compared to the S-300 or Bavar-373.

### 3. **Short-Range Air Defense Systems (SHORAD)**
- **Tor-M1** (NATO reporting name: SA-15 Gauntlet):
  - Iran acquired the **Tor-M1** from Russia, and it is designed to intercept low-flying targets such as aircraft, drones, and cruise missiles at shorter ranges (**up to 12-15 kilometers**).
  
- **Pantsir-S1** (NATO reporting name: SA-22 Greyhound):
  - This system combines both **guns and missiles** and provides defense against precision-guided munitions, aircraft, and UAVs. The **Pantsir-S1** is designed to complement longer-range systems and is usually deployed close to key assets.

- **Ya Zahra and Tabas**:
  - These are Iranian short-range air defense systems modeled after the Hawk platform. They are used to fill gaps in coverage and provide point defense, making them key for defending specific installations.

### 4. **Early Warning and Surveillance Radar Networks**
Iran’s air defenses rely heavily on a network of **early warning and surveillance radars** to detect and track aircraft over long distances. The radar network includes:
- **Over-the-Horizon (OTH) Radars**: Iran has developed or imported OTH radars to detect incoming threats at very long ranges.
- **Mobile Radar Systems**: These systems are crucial to provide flexibility and to counter any attempt to locate and neutralize fixed radar installations.
- **Passive Detection Systems**: Iran is also known to use passive detection and **electronic warfare** equipment to monitor radar emissions from attacking aircraft, making stealth operations more challenging.

### 5. **Electronic Warfare (EW) Systems**
Iran uses **electronic warfare** systems to jam, deceive, or confuse enemy radar, communications, and navigation systems. For an IDF strike, managing **electronic countermeasures (ECM)** would be essential to evade detection, prevent targeting, and mitigate air defense response times.

### **Tactics Required for the IDF to Evade Defenses**
To carry out strikes against Tehran while evading these air defenses, the IDF would need to employ a sophisticated combination of **tactics and technology**, which might include:

1. **Stealth Technology**:
   - Israel possesses the **F-35I Adir**, a variant of the F-35 stealth fighter. Stealth features reduce the radar cross-section of the aircraft, making it significantly harder for Iranian radar systems like the S-300 or Bavar-373 to detect and track.
   
2. **Electronic Warfare (EW)**:
   - The IDF might deploy EW aircraft, such as the **Gulfstream G550 Shavit**, which can provide jamming, deception, and suppression of enemy radars.
   - The **F-16I Sufa** and **F-15I Ra’am** are also equipped with advanced electronic warfare suites that could be used to degrade the capabilities of enemy radar and missile systems.

3. **Low-Altitude Penetration and Terrain Masking**:
   - Flying at **very low altitudes** can help evade radar detection. **Ground clutter** significantly hampers the ability of long-range radar systems to accurately track aircraft.
   - Using the **terrain to mask their approach** can further reduce the effectiveness of enemy detection, especially when flying over mountainous regions or valleys.

4. **Decoys and UAVs**:
   - The use of **decoys** such as drones could help to distract Iranian air defenses, forcing them to target non-critical assets. Israel has a wide array of drones that can simulate aircraft profiles and force Iran to activate air defenses prematurely.
   - **Loitering munitions** (like the **Harop** drone) could also be used to strike air defense systems in a **Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD)** role before or during the strike.

5. **Pre-emptive Strikes (SEAD Missions)**:
   - Before attempting to penetrate Iranian airspace over Tehran, the IDF could conduct **SEAD missions** to neutralize key air defense installations.
   - This might involve a combination of **missile strikes** (like the **Delilah cruise missile**) and **anti-radiation missiles** aimed at known SAM sites and radar installations.

6. **Air-to-Ground Stand-Off Weapons**:
   - Using **stand-off weapons** like **Popeye** or **SPICE** missiles would allow IDF aircraft to strike targets without getting close enough to be within the effective range of air defense systems.
   - Long-range air-to-surface missiles allow attacks from **outside the defended zones**, minimizing exposure to air defenses.

### **Challenges for the IDF**
The IDF faces several challenges in evading Iran’s air defense network around Tehran:
- **Overlapping Coverage**: Tehran's air defenses are highly layered, meaning that different systems cover one another, creating a dense network that is difficult to penetrate without exposure.
- **Integration and Redundancy**: Iran’s IADS integrates multiple radar types (early warning, tracking, fire control) which improves detection probability, even if individual radars are jammed or taken out.
- **Redundancy and Mobility**: Many of Iran’s air defense systems are **mobile** and can be quickly redeployed to different locations, making targeting them challenging.
  
### **Summary**
In order to strike Tehran, the IDF would need to evade a formidable combination of **S-300PMU-2**, **Bavar-373**, **Khordad-3**, **Tor-M1**, **Pantsir-S1**, and other medium- and short-range systems. Successfully evading these defenses would require:
- **Stealth aircraft** like the F-35I,
- **Electronic warfare** to jam and deceive Iranian radar,
- **Low-altitude terrain masking**,
- **SEAD missions** to degrade air defense capabilities,
- **Decoys** to distract or overwhelm defenses, and
- **Stand-off weapons** to strike from beyond the engagement range of the air defense systems.

The IDF has the capability to use a mix of **stealth, electronic warfare, and preemptive strikes** to disrupt and evade the sophisticated and multi-layered air defense systems surrounding Tehran.
