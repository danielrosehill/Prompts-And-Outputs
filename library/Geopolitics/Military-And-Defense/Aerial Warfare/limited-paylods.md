# Prompt

Recently, Israel pulled off a widespread series of airstrikes inside Iran. 

However, the ability of each individual fighter jet to carry munitions is somewhat restrictive. 

How do military planners work around these challenges? Is it just about using lots of planes?

# Output

You asked how air forces, particularly Israel's, manage to conduct widespread aerial strikes given that each F-35 can only carry a limited number of bombs. The answer involves a combination of strategies that maximize the effectiveness of the aircraft and the overall air campaign.

### 1. F-35 Versatility and "Beast Mode"

While the F-35 is often used in stealth mode, where it carries a limited payload (around 5,700 pounds of internal weapons), it can switch to "Beast Mode" when stealth is no longer a priority. In this configuration, the aircraft can carry up to 22,000 pounds of ordnance by utilizing external hardpoints in addition to its internal weapons bay. This allows it to carry significantly more bombs and missiles, albeit at the cost of reduced stealth and range\[1]. This flexibility enables the F-35 to participate in both precision strikes and larger-scale bombardments once air superiority has been established.

### 2. Multirole Fighter Fleet

Israel’s air force does not rely solely on the F-35 for its strike capabilities. It operates a diverse fleet of multirole fighters, including F-15s and F-16s, which can carry larger payloads and are often used alongside the F-35 in coordinated operations. For example, during large-scale operations, Israel has deployed over 100 aircraft—including F-35s and other fighters—to strike multiple targets simultaneously\[2]. This approach spreads the workload across many planes, allowing for widespread strikes even if each individual aircraft carries a relatively small number of bombs.

### 3. Precision Targeting

The Israeli Air Force (IAF) emphasizes precision in its strikes, often targeting high-value military assets such as missile facilities, radar systems, and command centers. This focus on precision allows fewer bombs to achieve significant strategic effects by neutralizing critical enemy capabilities\[2]\[3]. Advanced intelligence gathering and real-time coordination further enhance the effectiveness of these strikes.

### 4. Aerial Refueling and Coordination

To extend the operational range of its aircraft during long-distance missions (such as those targeting Iran), Israel uses aerial refueling capabilities. This allows fighters like the F-15I Ra'am to reach distant targets while carrying heavy payloads\[6]. Additionally, well-coordinated strike packages—where different aircraft perform complementary roles (e.g., electronic warfare, air superiority, and ground attack)—help maximize the efficiency of each sortie\[3].

### 5. UAVs and Drones

Israel also uses unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for reconnaissance and real-time target identification, which helps optimize the timing and precision of manned airstrikes\[5]. These UAVs can help identify new threats or targets during an ongoing operation, allowing for dynamic adjustments without requiring additional manned sorties.

### Conclusion

In summary, while each F-35 may carry a limited number of bombs in stealth mode, air forces like Israel’s manage widespread aerial strikes through several strategies:

- Switching to "Beast Mode" when stealth is not required.
- Utilizing a diverse fleet of multirole fighters.
- Emphasizing precision targeting.
- Employing aerial refueling for extended missions.
- Integrating UAVs for real-time intelligence.

These tactics allow Israel to conduct large-scale operations efficiently without needing an overwhelming number of planes for every mission.
