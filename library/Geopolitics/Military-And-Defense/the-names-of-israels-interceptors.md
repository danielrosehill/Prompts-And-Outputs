Yes, the interceptor rockets used by Israel's **Arrow** and **Iron Dome** systems have specific names, and they are produced by Israeli defense companies in collaboration with international partners.

### 1. **Arrow System (Hetz)**
   - **Interceptor Name**: **Arrow 2** and **Arrow 3**.
   - **Manufacturers**: The **Arrow system** is developed by **Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI)** in collaboration with the **Israel Ministry of Defense** and the **United States Missile Defense Agency (MDA)**. Specifically, **Boeing** partners with IAI for the production of these interceptors.
   - **Purpose**: The Arrow system is designed for long-range missile defense, intercepting ballistic missiles outside Earth's atmosphere (Arrow 3) or in the upper atmosphere (Arrow 2).
   
### 2. **Iron Dome System**
   - **Interceptor Name**: **Tamir**.
   - **Manufacturers**: The **Iron Dome** interceptor rockets are developed by **Rafael Advanced Defense Systems** with support from **Raytheon** (U.S.), which helps with production and export.
   - **Purpose**: The **Tamir** interceptors are designed to intercept short-range rockets, artillery shells, and mortar rounds. The system has proven highly effective in defending against threats like rocket fire from Gaza.

### Additional Systems:
   - **David's Sling** (another part of Israel's missile defense):
     - **Interceptor Name**: **Stunner**.
     - **Manufacturers**: A joint project between **Rafael Advanced Defense Systems** and the **U.S.-based Raytheon**. It is designed to intercept medium-range ballistic missiles and cruise missiles.

Each system targets different threat profiles, with Arrow dealing with high-altitude threats and Iron Dome focusing on low-altitude short-range threats【109†source】【112†source】【110†source】.

# Matrix summarising info

Here is a data matrix for Israel's missile defense systems:

| **System**        | **Interceptor Name** | **Manufacturers**                                                            | **Purpose**                                                                                      |
| ----------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Arrow**         | Arrow 2, Arrow 3     | Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI), Boeing, U.S. Missile Defense Agency (MDA) | Intercept ballistic missiles at high altitudes (Arrow 3: outer space, Arrow 2: upper atmosphere) |
| **Iron Dome**     | Tamir                | Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, Raytheon                                    | Intercept short-range rockets, artillery shells, and mortars                                     |
| **David's Sling** | Stunner              | Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, Raytheon                                    | Intercept medium-range ballistic missiles and cruise missiles                                    |

This table summarizes the interceptor names, their manufacturers, and their purposes for each system.
