Tracking the evolution of Israel's geopolitical standing, particularly through optimistic signs of rapprochement or growing international ties, involves monitoring a blend of qualitative and quantitative data points across diplomacy, economy, defense, and cultural exchanges. Here’s a breakdown of some impactful datapoints:

1. **Diplomatic Relations**:
   - **Formalization of Relations**: Record when Israel establishes or upgrades diplomatic ties with new countries, particularly in regions where relations have historically been tense, like parts of the Arab world, Africa, and Asia. 
   - **Embassy Openings and Upgrades**: The establishment or reopening of embassies and consulates, particularly in key cities, is a strong indicator of mutual recognition and commitment.
   - **High-Level Visits and Summits**: Track official state visits by Israeli leaders and foreign leaders’ visits to Israel, which often signify strengthened relations.

2. **Economic Ties**:
   - **Bilateral Trade Agreements**: New trade agreements or expansions to existing ones (e.g., free trade agreements or sector-specific partnerships) show economic integration and mutual benefit.
   - **Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)**: Growing FDI from specific countries or regions in Israel and vice versa indicates deeper economic interdependence.
   - **Joint Ventures and Partnerships**: Note major collaborations between Israeli and foreign companies, especially in technology, defense, and agriculture, as these reflect increasing trust and interest in Israel’s sectors.

3. **Security and Defense Cooperation**:
   - **Defense Agreements and Military Cooperation**: Track agreements in defense technology, intelligence sharing, and joint military exercises, especially with countries that historically had strained relations with Israel.
   - **Counterterrorism Partnerships**: Collaborative anti-terrorism efforts, information exchanges, or official counterterrorism agreements often highlight shared security concerns and deepening alliances.

4. **Multilateral Engagements**:
   - **Participation in Regional Bodies**: Observe Israel’s membership or observer status in regional organizations (e.g., the African Union or ASEAN-related forums).
   - **United Nations Voting Patterns**: Trends in UN voting, especially from countries that traditionally voted against Israel, can indicate shifts in political sentiment.
   - **Coalitions in Global Governance**: Record alliances within organizations like the United Nations, WTO, or WHO where Israel cooperates closely with other nations on shared global challenges.

5. **Public and Cultural Diplomacy**:
   - **Cultural Exchanges**: New partnerships or events involving cultural exchanges (e.g., art exhibits, sports collaborations, academic exchange programs) show the softening of societal barriers.
   - **Educational and Scientific Collaboration**: Look for international academic partnerships, student exchange programs, and research collaborations that connect Israel with foreign institutions.
   - **Tourism Trends**: Track inbound and outbound tourism rates, especially with nations where travel restrictions have been eased or new flight paths are established, as this can signal warming relations.

6. **Public Opinion and Media Sentiment**:
   - **Public Opinion Polls**: Track international surveys on perceptions of Israel, particularly in countries showing changing opinions.
   - **Media Analysis**: Assessing media sentiment in foreign publications over time can reveal shifts in popular narratives regarding Israel.

7. **Humanitarian and Environmental Partnerships**:
   - **Joint Humanitarian Projects**: Cooperative disaster response or humanitarian aid projects, particularly in crisis zones, highlight goodwill and the potential for further diplomatic ties.
   - **Environmental Initiatives**: Collaborative projects addressing shared environmental challenges, such as water management in the Middle East, can be especially unifying.

8. **Technological and Innovation Partnerships**:
   - **Technology Hubs and Innovation Partnerships**: Initiatives like Israel becoming a hub for startups, incubators, or research centers with multinational partnerships are good indicators of soft-power influence.
   - **Cybersecurity Cooperation**: Given Israel’s prominence in cybersecurity, partnerships in this sector with countries around the world signal trusted alliances and shared strategic interests.

Tracking these datapoints over time and across multiple domains will reveal patterns that signal an evolution in Israel’s global standing, allowing for a nuanced perspective on rapprochement, growing ties, and shifting alliances.
