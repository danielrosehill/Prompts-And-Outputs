There are **six countries or regions** that operate their own Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) or similar positioning systems:

1. **United States**: Operates the **Global Positioning System (GPS)**, which was the first GNSS and provides global coverage.
2. **Russia**: Operates **GLONASS**, another global system providing worldwide coverage.
3. **China**: Operates the **BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS)**, which also offers global coverage.
4. **European Union**: Operates **Galileo**, a global GNSS system designed for civilian use.
5. **India**: Operates the **NavIC (Navigation with Indian Constellation)**, which is a regional system primarily covering India and surrounding areas.
6. **Japan**: Operates the **Quasi-Zenith Satellite System (QZSS)**, a regional system that enhances GPS coverage in Japan and the Asia-Oceania region.

Thus, six countries or regions have developed and operate their own independent navigation satellite systems, with some offering global services and others focusing on regional coverage\[3]\[4].
