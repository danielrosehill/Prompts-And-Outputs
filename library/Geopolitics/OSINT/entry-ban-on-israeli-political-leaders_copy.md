As of now, Belgium has taken steps to enact entry bans on specific Israeli officials and extremist settlers. Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo announced that extremist West Bank settlers would be prohibited from entering the country, and the Belgian Foreign Minister, Hadja Lahbib, stated that they would push for a similar entry ban across the European Union【72†source】. 

In addition to Belgium, there have been discussions in other European countries about imposing entry bans on Israeli officials. For example, there have been proposals and discussions regarding sanctions against extremist Israeli settlers at various international forums【71†source】【72†source】. However, as of now, specific legislation similar to Belgium's has not been widely reported in other European countries.
