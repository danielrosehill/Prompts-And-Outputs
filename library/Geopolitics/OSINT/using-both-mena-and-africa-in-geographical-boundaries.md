# Prompt

There are a few geopolitical catchments that I've seen that might overlap: MENA, North Africa, Subsaharan Africa. Can you recommend some approaches that could be used to distinguish these?

# Output
To distinguish between **MENA**, **North Africa**, and **Sub-Saharan Africa**, here are a few approaches that can be used:

### 1. **Geographical Boundaries**:
   - **MENA (Middle East and North Africa)**: Encompasses a broad region, including North African countries like Egypt, Libya, and Tunisia, and Middle Eastern countries like Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Iran.
   - **North Africa**: Includes the northernmost countries of the African continent, typically Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, and Egypt.
   - **Sub-Saharan Africa**: Refers to the region south of the Sahara Desert, including countries like Nigeria, South Africa, Kenya, and Ethiopia.

### 2. **Cultural and Religious Factors**:
   - **MENA**: Predominantly Arabic-speaking with significant Islamic influence.
   - **North Africa**: Shares cultural overlap with the Arab world but has distinct Berber and Mediterranean influences.
   - **Sub-Saharan Africa**: Features a more diverse mix of cultures, languages, and religions, with a higher prevalence of indigenous and Christian communities.

### 3. **Economic and Political Focus**:
   - **MENA**: A geopolitical catchment tied to oil economies, the Arab-Israeli conflict, and Islamic governance.
   - **North Africa**: Often involved in Mediterranean trade, closely linked with Europe, and shares political challenges with the Arab world.
   - **Sub-Saharan Africa**: More associated with development challenges, resource economies (e.g., minerals, agriculture), and varied governance issues.

### 4. **Historical Context**:
   - **MENA**: Historically tied to the Islamic caliphates, Ottoman Empire, and Arab League.
   - **North Africa**: Historically part of both Mediterranean empires (e.g., Carthage, Roman Empire) and Islamic conquests.
   - **Sub-Saharan Africa**: More impacted by colonial history and post-colonial development challenges.

### 5. **Institutional Usage**:
   - **MENA**: Used by organizations like the World Bank, IMF, and United Nations to describe both political and economic groupings.
   - **North Africa**: Usually defined as a subset within MENA or separately due to its closer proximity and trade with Europe.
   - **Sub-Saharan Africa**: Commonly used to refer to developmental and humanitarian policy targeting countries south of the Sahara.

By leveraging these factors, you can clearly distinguish between the regions based on geography, culture, economics, history, and institutional relevance.
