**Hezbollah's Current Arsenal Compared to Iran's**

Hezbollah is considered the most heavily armed non-state actor in the world, with an estimated arsenal of about 130,000 to 150,000 rockets and missiles. These include a variety of **unguided artillery rockets**, **ballistic missiles**, **anti-ship missiles**, **anti-tank missiles**, and a growing number of **drones**. The group's weapons primarily come from **Iran**, which supplies Hezbollah with missiles and other military technology, along with training and logistical support.

### **Hezbollah's Arsenal**
1. **Missiles and Rockets**:
   - Hezbollah possesses a wide range of missiles such as **Falaq-1 and Falaq-2** rockets, with ranges around 10 to 11 km, and **Khaibar-1** rockets with a range of up to 100 km. The group also has **Zelzal-1 and Zelzal-2**, which can reach between 125 and 210 km, making them capable of targeting deep into Israel. These rockets typically carry large payloads of high explosives, making them significant threats despite their limited accuracy【103†source】【105†source】.
   - **Fateh-110/M-600** missiles are more sophisticated, with ranges of up to 300 km and GPS-guidance, allowing Hezbollah to target critical sites in Israel with higher precision【105†source】.

2. **Drones**:
   - Hezbollah has been equipped by Iran with various types of drones, including **Shahed 136 attack drones** and other unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). These drones have ranges of up to 1,700 km and can carry payloads of about 150 kg, giving Hezbollah significant reconnaissance and attack capabilities【102†source】【103†source】.

3. **Anti-Ship and Anti-Aircraft Capabilities**:
   - Hezbollah's anti-ship arsenal includes **Russian Yakhont** and **Chinese Silkworm missiles**, which have long ranges and can target Israeli naval assets, including ships and offshore platforms. The group also has **surface-to-air missiles**, which they claim have been used to target Israeli drones and warplanes【103†source】.

4. **Fighters and Tunnels**:
   - Hezbollah claims it can mobilize over **100,000 fighters**, with a core group of experienced combatants trained by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). Additionally, Hezbollah has an extensive network of **underground tunnels** in southern Lebanon, providing it with strategic cover and allowing the group to operate effectively even under heavy bombardment【103†source】【104†source】.

### **Iran's Arsenal**
In comparison, Iran's military capabilities are significantly larger and more advanced. Iran has the largest missile arsenal in the Middle East, consisting of **short- to medium-range ballistic missiles** like the **Zelzal**, **Fateh-110**, and **Scud-B/C/D** variants, with ranges reaching up to 550 km. It also possesses a wide variety of advanced drones and has invested heavily in domestic missile production. Iran's ballistic missile arsenal includes powerful systems such as the **Khorramshahr** and **Shahab** missile families, which have much greater range and payload capabilities compared to Hezbollah's armament【102†source】【105†source】.

Moreover, Iran maintains a powerful conventional military, with **600,000 active military personnel**, as well as significant air and naval capabilities. This allows Iran to project its power regionally, whereas Hezbollah remains focused on asymmetric warfare and regional conflicts primarily involving Israel【101†source】.

### **Summary**
- **Hezbollah** has a massive arsenal of around **130,000 to 150,000 rockets** and **missiles**, which are mostly unguided but capable of reaching most of Israel. Their **anti-aircraft**, **anti-ship**, and **drone** capabilities have also improved significantly in recent years.
- **Iran**, on the other hand, is the source of much of Hezbollah's armament and has a far larger and more sophisticated military. It has a diverse arsenal of **ballistic missiles**, **drones**, and **conventional military assets**, positioning it as a major regional power.

The strategic relationship between Iran and Hezbollah means that while Hezbollah can field a significant missile and rocket threat to Israel, its arsenal pales in comparison to Iran’s much broader, technologically advanced capabilities. Iran provides Hezbollah with the arms, training, and resources necessary for it to act as a proxy in Lebanon, extending Iran’s influence across the Middle East.
