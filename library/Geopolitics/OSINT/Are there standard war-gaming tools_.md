## Prompt

One commonly hears in the media that militaries are engaging in "war-gaming" - simulating various military scenarios.

What does war-gaming entail, exactly? Is a standardised method used worldwide? Or does each military develop a somewhat novel approach to this, reflecting the uniqueness of its circumstances?

## Output

When militaries refer to *war-gaming*, they are talking about the simulation of military operations, typically involving two or more opposing forces, to explore strategic, tactical, or operational scenarios. These simulations are designed to model warfare without the use of actual forces, allowing military personnel to practice decision-making, test strategies, and analyze outcomes in a controlled environment. War-gaming can range from simple tabletop exercises to complex computer-assisted simulations.

### Definition and Purpose

War-gaming is broadly defined as a decision-making exercise where participants simulate aspects of warfare. Peter Perla, a key figure in the field, describes it as "a warfare model or simulation that does not involve the operations of actual forces, in which the flow of events is affected by decisions made by players representing opposing sides" \[1]. The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) defines it as "a simulation of a military operation involving two or more opposing forces, using rules, data, and procedures designed to depict an actual or assumed real-life situation" \[1].

The primary purposes of war-gaming include:

- **Training and Education**: War-gaming helps military leaders practice decision-making in realistic scenarios. It provides a safe environment to learn from mistakes without real-world consequences \[4].
- **Strategic Planning**: War games are used to explore potential future conflicts and develop military strategies. They help in testing new doctrines and technologies before they are deployed in actual operations \[4]\[6].
- **Analysis and Research**: War games can be used to analyze the effectiveness of different strategies and tactics. They allow militaries to assess potential outcomes of conflicts based on various scenarios \[6].

### Types of War Games

War games can vary significantly in complexity:

- **Manual/Analog Games**: These are traditional tabletop simulations where players use physical maps and tokens to represent units. These games often involve referees who manage the rules and outcomes \[8].
- **Computer-Assisted Games**: Modern war-gaming often involves computer software that assists with managing complex scenarios, tracking unit movements, and adjudicating outcomes based on predefined rules \[5]. For example, the SWIFT (Standard Wargame Integration Facilitation Toolkit) is a tool used by the U.S. Department of Defense for turn-based wargames \[5].
- **Hybrid Games**: Some war games combine both analog and digital elements to provide a more flexible and dynamic experience \[8].

### Standardization vs. Customization

There is no single standardized tool used across all militaries for war-gaming. Each military typically develops or adopts tools that suit its specific needs:

- **Custom Tools**: Many militaries develop their own war-gaming tools tailored to their operational requirements. For example, the U.S. Naval War College has been conducting war games since 1887 using both custom-designed games and commercially available systems \[1].
- **Commercial Software**: Some militaries use off-the-shelf software for certain types of simulations. For instance, Decisive Action is a commercial simulation software used by the U.S. Army for certain exercises \[8].
- **Collaborative Development**: In some cases, militaries collaborate with external organizations like federally funded research centers or defense contractors to develop specialized wargames \[7].

In summary, *war-gaming* refers to structured simulations used by militaries for training, planning, and analysis. While there is no single standardized tool for war-gaming globally, many nations develop their own systems or adapt commercial tools depending on their specific needs.
