Flight tracking websites like FlightAware collect and aggregate data from various sources to provide real-time information about air traffic. Here’s a breakdown of the primary data sources they utilize:

### Data Sources for Flight Tracking Websites

1. **ADS-B (Automatic Dependent Surveillance–Broadcast)**
   - **Overview**: A surveillance technology that allows aircraft to determine their position via satellite navigation and periodically broadcast it. Ground stations and other aircraft can receive this information.
   - **Data Collected**:
     - Aircraft position (latitude and longitude)
     - Altitude
     - Speed
     - Heading
     - Flight number and registration
   - **Importance**: This data is crucial for real-time tracking and is used by many flight tracking services.

2. **Multilateration (MLAT)**
   - **Overview**: A method of determining the position of an aircraft using signals received from multiple ground stations.
   - **Data Collected**: Similar to ADS-B, it provides position and velocity information, particularly for aircraft not equipped with ADS-B.
   - **Importance**: Helps fill in gaps in coverage, especially in areas with fewer ground stations.

3. **FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) Data**
   - **Overview**: In the U.S., the FAA collects and provides access to air traffic data, including flight plans, terminal area movements, and radar data.
   - **Data Collected**:
     - Flight plans and schedules
     - Status of flights (delays, cancellations)
     - Historical flight data
   - **Importance**: Provides authoritative data on flight operations within U.S. airspace.

4. **Airline Data Feeds**
   - **Overview**: Airlines provide data on their flights, which can include updates on delays, cancellations, and gate changes.
   - **Data Collected**:
     - Schedule changes
     - Operational status
   - **Importance**: Ensures accurate information on flight status and operational changes.

5. **Airport Data**
   - **Overview**: Airports publish real-time data on arrivals and departures, including gate information.
   - **Data Collected**:
     - Flight schedules
     - Ground movements
     - Delays and cancellations
   - **Importance**: Enhances the accuracy of real-time tracking for flights at specific airports.

6. **Satellite Data**
   - **Overview**: Some flight tracking services may use satellite data to track flights, especially over oceans or remote areas where ground-based radar is unavailable.
   - **Data Collected**: 
     - Position and altitude data from satellite systems.
   - **Importance**: Provides global coverage for flights that may not be visible through traditional tracking methods.

7. **User Contributions**
   - **Overview**: Some platforms allow users to contribute flight data or report sightings, particularly for general aviation and private flights.
   - **Data Collected**: 
     - Additional information on flight movements and aircraft.
   - **Importance**: Enriches the dataset and helps track less conventional flights.

### Conclusion

By combining these various data sources, flight tracking websites can provide comprehensive and accurate information about aircraft movements worldwide. This data is crucial for passengers, aviation enthusiasts, and OSINT users who require real-time and historical flight information for analysis and monitoring purposes.
