Opinion polls in Iran reveal complex and varied attitudes towards Israel, often shaped by the government's official stance and regional dynamics. A 2023 survey indicated that 67% of Iranians viewed Israel as a threat, with many associating Israeli actions with anti-Iranian sentiments and alleged acts of terrorism. Additionally, 73% of respondents believed Israeli policies and conflicts could lead to economic challenges for Iran, further influencing public perceptions. However, a significant portion, 79%, favored strong retaliatory actions against perceived Israeli threats, reflecting a hardline stance on national defense and sovereignty issues.

Despite the government's anti-Israel rhetoric, there are indications that these views are not uniformly shared across Iranian society. Instances of backlash against pro-Palestinian propaganda, such as during public events, suggest that anti-Israel sentiment may not be as deeply ingrained among ordinary Iranians as the official stance might imply.

Moreover, external surveys highlight how public opinion on normalization with Israel remains a contentious issue across the Middle East. Efforts to shift attitudes through official agreements, like the Abraham Accords, have not fully translated into widespread public acceptance, reflecting a broader regional skepticism that influences Iran as well.

These polls provide a glimpse into the multifaceted and often contradictory nature of public sentiment in Iran regarding Israel, suggesting that government narratives and grassroots opinions do not always align.
