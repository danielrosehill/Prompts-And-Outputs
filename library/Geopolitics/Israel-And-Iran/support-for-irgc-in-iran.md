Survey data from Gamaan, a Netherlands-based institute that conducts research on Iranian public opinion, indicates that the IRGC (Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps) does not enjoy widespread support among the Iranian population. In surveys related to broader political attitudes, a significant portion of respondents expressed dissatisfaction with the overall system of the Islamic Republic, with about 75% indicating they would boycott elections, and 75% stating they would vote against the regime in a hypothetical referendum.

The surveys also suggest that many Iranians are critical of the government’s policies, including its regional interventions, often associated with the IRGC’s activities. The data underscores a general trend of declining support for entities tied to the regime, though precise figures specifically isolating support for the IRGC in recent surveys weren't highlighted. However, past findings indicate that large-scale dissatisfaction persists, impacting institutions closely linked to state control, including the IRGC.

These surveys are conducted using online methods to ensure anonymity, aiming to reduce self-censorship and offer a clearer view of public sentiment, even if traditional polling remains challenging in Iran.
