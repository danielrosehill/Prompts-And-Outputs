Israel has carried out a series of airstrikes across Iran on October 26, 2024, targeting key military sites, including facilities associated with missile and drone production. This operation is a retaliatory response to Iran's earlier ballistic missile attack on Israel at the beginning of the month. The strikes involved over 100 aircraft, including advanced F-35 jets, and were coordinated to hit multiple strategic locations, including military bases in Tehran and other regions like Karaj. Some of these locations are linked to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and defense facilities that could pose a threat to Israel in the future. 

The strikes also seem to be part of a broader military strategy, as simultaneous actions were reported in Syria, Iraq, and Gaza, suggesting a concerted effort to counteract Iranian proxies throughout the region. Israeli officials have indicated that the operation is a precautionary measure to neutralize potential threats and disrupt Iranian military capabilities without escalating into a full-scale conflict【21†source】【22†source】.

### Probability of Iranian Retaliation
There are strong indications that Iran may consider retaliating against these strikes. Historically, Iran has responded to direct military action by Israel, and recent statements from Tehran emphasize their "duty" to defend against such attacks. Furthermore, Iran has coordinated with allied groups in the region, and increased activity from proxy forces could signal an indirect response in the near term【22†source】.

### Signs of Imminent Retaliation
- **Military Readiness**: Iranian media has downplayed the severity of the damage, but reports suggest heightened military alertness. Iran's decision to close airspace temporarily and resume flights may indicate precautionary measures against further strikes, and it could also be positioning forces in anticipation of escalation【21†source】.
- **Proxy Activity**: Israel's attacks extended beyond Iran to target regional proxies, including strikes in Syria and reports of artillery actions in Gaza. Any renewed hostilities from groups like Hezbollah or militias in Iraq could be interpreted as a coordinated retaliatory effort on behalf of Iran【22†source】.
- **Diplomatic Rhetoric**: Statements from Tehran have been stern, and Israeli leaders have issued warnings against further escalation, suggesting ongoing tension. If diplomatic overtures or behind-the-scenes negotiations fail, Iran might proceed with direct or proxy retaliation.

While the situation remains fluid, both nations appear poised to defend their interests, making further conflict possible. Monitoring regional developments and proxy actions will be critical to assessing the likelihood of imminent retaliation.
