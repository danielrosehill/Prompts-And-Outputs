# Prompt

Since October 7th, the Irish government has become increasingly vitriolic in its criticism of Israel and more determined in its attempts to act to harm Israel's interests at the EU and international fora. If this trajectory continues, what kind of developments might we expect over the next 12 months?

# Output

You asked about the potential steps Ireland might take over the next 12 months if its hostility towards Israel continues to increase at the current pace, following the October 7, 2023, events. Based on the trajectory of Irish-Israeli relations and recent statements from Irish leaders, several developments could unfold if tensions continue to escalate.

## Possible Steps Over the Next 12 Months

### 1. Trade Restrictions

Ireland has already indicated a willingness to act unilaterally to restrict trade with Israel, particularly concerning goods produced in Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories. Irish Taoiseach Simon Harris has made it clear that Ireland "will not wait" for broader European Union (EU) consensus on this issue and is seeking legal advice on how to proceed independently\[1]\[5]. If hostility continues to grow, Ireland may pass or revive legislation like the *Occupied Territories Bill*, which would make it illegal to import goods from Israeli settlements\[6]. This could be a significant step towards severing economic ties with Israel.

### 2. Diplomatic Downgrades

Diplomatic relations between Ireland and Israel have already been strained, with no Israeli ambassador currently stationed in Dublin due to deteriorating relations\[2]. If tensions worsen, Ireland could further downgrade diplomatic ties, potentially expelling Israeli diplomats or formally recalling its own ambassador from Israel. A complete severance of diplomatic relations is also conceivable if hostilities intensify.

### 3. Increased Pressure on the EU

Ireland has been vocal in urging the EU to reconsider its trade relations with Israel, particularly in light of human rights concerns\[3]. Over the next year, Ireland could intensify its lobbying efforts within the EU to suspend or review the EU-Israel Association Agreement, which governs trade relations between Israel and the EU\[5]. If successful, this could lead to broader European sanctions or restrictions on Israel.

### 4. Advocacy for Palestinian Statehood

Ireland has been one of the more vocal European countries in supporting Palestinian statehood. In 2024, it formally recognized a Palestinian state alongside Spain and other nations\[3]. Given this stance, Ireland may push for further international recognition of Palestine and advocate for stronger international action against Israel in forums like the United Nations or other multilateral organizations.

### 5. Public and Political Mobilization

Domestically, public opinion in Ireland has historically been sympathetic towards Palestinians, and political parties such as Sinn FÃ©in have been critical of Israel's policies\[4]. If hostilities increase, we can expect further mobilization of public protests and political pressure within Ireland to take even stronger actions against Israel. This could include calls for boycotts or divestments targeting Israeli companies or products.

### 6. Legal Actions

Ireland may also explore legal avenues through international courts or organizations like the International Criminal Court (ICC) to hold Israel accountable for alleged violations of international law. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) advisory opinion from July 2024 has already provided some legal grounds for Ireland to act against what it considers an unlawful occupation\[6].

## Conclusion

If hostility between Ireland and Israel continues to escalate at its current pace over the next 12 months, we can expect a combination of unilateral trade restrictions, diplomatic downgrades, intensified pressure within the EU for collective action against Israel, and increased advocacy for Palestinian statehood. Public sentiment and political mobilization within Ireland will likely drive these actions further.
