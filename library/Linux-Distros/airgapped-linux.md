You asked about specific Linux distributions designed for deployment in air-gapped environments. Several Linux distributions and tools are tailored for such scenarios, where the system is isolated from external networks, including the internet. Here are some examples:

## Distributions and Tools for Air-Gapped Installations

1. **Airgap OS**\
   Airgap OS is a live, amnesic Linux distribution specifically designed for air-gapped environments. It prevents any network communication and is built for handling highly sensitive tasks such as managing PKI root private keys or storing cryptocurrency cold wallets. It is based on Debian and includes security tools like GnuPG2, cryptographic utilities, and smartcard support. Airgap OS ensures that no network communication occurs unless explicitly enabled, making it ideal for secure offline operations\[4].
2. **Tails**\
   Tails (The Amnesic Incognito Live System) is another security-focused Linux distribution designed to be run as a live system from a USB stick or DVD. While its primary use case is privacy and anonymity through the Tor network, it can also be deployed in air-gapped environments by disabling network interfaces. Tails leaves no trace on the host machine, making it suitable for temporary, high-security offline tasks\[3].
3. **Qubes OS**\
   Qubes OS takes a different approach by leveraging virtualization to provide strong isolation between different tasks or "qubes." While Qubes itself can be connected to the internet, it can also be configured for use in air-gapped environments by isolating certain qubes from any network access entirely. This makes it suitable for scenarios where compartmentalization of tasks is crucial\[3].
4. **Subgraph OS**\
   Subgraph OS is built with security in mind and includes features like sandboxing and application-level firewalling to protect against malware and network attacks. Although it is designed to operate securely even when connected to the internet, Subgraph OS can be deployed in air-gapped environments by disabling network interfaces\[3].

## Tools for Air-Gapped Deployment

1. **KubeSphere with KubeKey**\
   KubeSphere provides tools for deploying Kubernetes clusters in air-gapped environments using KubeKey. This tool allows users to prepare all necessary packages and dependencies offline, then deploy them in isolated networks without internet access\[1]\[5]. This is particularly useful for organizations running containerized applications that need to comply with strict security policies.
2. **ScyllaDB**\
   ScyllaDB provides instructions for installing its database software in air-gapped environments by downloading all required packages (RPMs or DEBs) on an online machine and transferring them to the air-gapped server\[2]. This method ensures that all dependencies are met without requiring external connections during installation.
3. **Elemental (Rancher)**\
   Elemental, part of Rancherâ€™s ecosystem, offers an immutable Linux distribution designed for Kubernetes clusters. It supports air-gapped installations by allowing users to prepare container images and charts offline, which can then be deployed in isolated environments\[6].

In summary, several Linux distributions like Airgap OS, Tails, Qubes OS, and Subgraph OS are well-suited for air-gapped installations due to their security features or ability to operate without network connections. Additionally, tools like KubeSphere (with KubeKey) and ScyllaDB provide robust solutions for deploying software in air-gapped environments where connectivity is restricted or prohibited.
