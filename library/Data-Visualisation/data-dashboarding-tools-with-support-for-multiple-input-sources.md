### Summary of your prompt:
You are asking for tools that provide the most flexibility for creating complex visualizations that can combine multiple data sources (dynamic and static). You also want a full breakdown of the services that would need to be deployed in each stack, considering both cloud and self-hosted approaches.

### Tools That Offer the Most Flexibility for Creating Complex Visualizations:

In addition to **Grafana**, **Apache Superset**, **Metabase**, and **Redash**, here are some additional tools that provide flexibility for creating rich, interactive visualizations:

1. **Plotly Dash**
   - **Overview**: Plotly Dash is a highly flexible Python framework for building custom data visualizations and dashboards. It allows you to write Python code to create dynamic and interactive visualizations that can ingest data from multiple sources, including databases, APIs, and CSV files.
   - **Flexibility**: Dash provides full flexibility because you can write your own logic to combine and manipulate data from any source. For instance, you can combine live financial data from an API and data from a local database by writing a custom Python script.
   - **Publishing**: Dash applications can be hosted on any server, or you can use Plotly's managed cloud service to deploy them. It supports embedding in websites or sharing via public URLs.
   - **Best For**: Python developers needing maximum flexibility and custom control over their visualizations.

2. **Power BI (with Python or R integration)**
   - **Overview**: Power BI is a well-known business intelligence tool that provides a broad range of visualizations. It also allows integration with Python or R scripts, which adds significant flexibility.
   - **Flexibility**: Power BI allows you to integrate multiple data sources (e.g., databases, APIs, Excel sheets) and apply complex logic using its built-in functions or through Python/R scripts. This makes it possible to fetch API data, combine it with database data, and perform advanced calculations.
   - **Publishing**: Power BI has a cloud service for sharing dashboards (Power BI Service), or you can self-host with Power BI Report Server. It supports embedding dashboards into websites.
   - **Best For**: Users wanting a mix of powerful built-in visualizations with the flexibility to extend capabilities using Python/R for complex data operations.

3. **Tableau (with Custom SQL and APIs)**
   - **Overview**: Tableau is another highly flexible data visualization tool known for its interactivity and ease of use. It allows users to create advanced visualizations using drag-and-drop functionality, as well as custom SQL queries for combining data sources.
   - **Flexibility**: Tableau allows integration with various data sources (e.g., databases, APIs) and provides a custom SQL interface for combining them. It supports calculated fields, which allows for logic such as multiplying API data by database values.
   - **Publishing**: Tableau offers Tableau Public (free) for publishing dashboards or Tableau Server for on-premises deployment. Tableau dashboards can be embedded in blogs or websites.
   - **Best For**: Those seeking intuitive data visualization capabilities combined with custom query flexibility.
