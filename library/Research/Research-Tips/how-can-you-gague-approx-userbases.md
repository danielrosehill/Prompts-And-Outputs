# Prompt

what are some reliable ways that one can use to estimate the userbase of an app. For instance I would love to know approximately how big feeder is (feeder.co) compared to feedly and inoreader

# Output
Estimating the **user base** of an app, especially when detailed user statistics are not publicly available, requires gathering data from various indirect sources. Here are some **reliable methods** for estimating the size of an app’s user base:

### **1. Publicly Available Statistics (App Stores)**
   - **App Store Listings**: If the app is available on **Google Play** or the **Apple App Store**, you can view download counts and user reviews. For example:
     - **Google Play Store** often shows a range of downloads (e.g., 100k+ or 1M+).
     - **Apple App Store** doesn't display download numbers but offers user reviews, which can provide insights into engagement.
   - **Comparing to Other Apps**: You can compare the app’s download numbers and reviews to competitors (e.g., comparing Feeder, Feedly, and Inoreader’s Google Play stats).

### **2. Third-Party Platforms (Like SimilarWeb or App Annie)**
   - **SimilarWeb**: This platform estimates website traffic, app downloads, and user engagement metrics. It can give you insights into monthly visitors or app usage statistics for **web-based apps** like **Feeder**, **Feedly**, and **Inoreader**.
     - **SimilarWeb** often provides traffic ranking, visit duration, and bounce rate, which can help assess the relative popularity of each app.
   - **App Annie**: Provides app analytics, including estimated download numbers, revenue data, and app store rankings. It’s useful for seeing the performance of apps over time.

### **3. BuiltWith and Wappalyzer (For Web-Based Apps)**
   - **BuiltWith**: This tool can show you how many websites are using a particular app or service if the app has a web integration or API. For example, for **Feeder** and **Inoreader**, you could see how many websites have their integrations installed.
   - **Wappalyzer**: This tool helps analyze which technologies and services are used on websites, giving insights into the market penetration of web-based apps like Feeder.

### **4. User Reviews and Forums**
   - **User Reviews**: Check user reviews on app stores, Reddit, or tech forums. Apps with a larger, more engaged user base will generally have more reviews, comments, and feedback.
   - **Reddit & Communities**: Communities like **Reddit** (r/feedly, r/rss) often discuss apps in terms of their user base, feature sets, and performance, providing informal insights into popularity.

### **5. Company Reports and PR Statements**
   - **Company Announcements**: Companies often release milestones or press statements when they reach certain user numbers. For instance, if **Feedly** reaches 10 million users, it’s likely they would publicize that.
   - **Interviews or Blog Posts**: Look for interviews with company executives, blog posts, or annual reports that might hint at their **active user base** or subscription numbers.

### **6. Web Traffic Analysis**
   - **Web Traffic Comparison**: Tools like **Alexa**, **SimilarWeb**, or **Ahrefs** can show the web traffic for the **Feeder**, **Feedly**, and **Inoreader** websites. While web traffic doesn’t directly equate to the app’s total user base, it can provide a comparison of user engagement and popularity.
     - **Ahrefs**: This SEO tool also offers traffic estimates, backlinks, and search volume for websites.

### **7. Social Media Followers**
   - **Social Media Presence**: The number of followers on **Twitter**, **Facebook**, and **LinkedIn** can provide a rough proxy for the user base. Larger, more established apps will generally have bigger followings.
   - **Engagement Metrics**: Check how active the user base is on social media—more active and engaged communities usually signal larger user bases.

### **8. Freemium Model Data (if available)**
   - Apps like **Feedly** and **Inoreader** often offer **freemium models**. Sometimes, estimates of paying users vs. free users can be inferred from public statements or interviews.
   - The ratio of free-to-paid users in typical freemium models can range from 5% to 10% of total users being paying users. Knowing subscription prices or total revenue (if available) could help estimate the total user base.

### Example Estimation for **Feeder**, **Feedly**, and **Inoreader**:

1. **Feeder (feeder.co)**:
   - **Google Play Downloads**: Check the **Play Store** to see download counts.
   - **Website Traffic**: Use **SimilarWeb** to estimate monthly visitors.
   - **BuiltWith/Wappalyzer**: Check how many sites use Feeder’s API or integrations.

2. **Feedly**:
   - **Google Play Downloads**: Feedly is well-known to have over **5 million+ downloads** on the Play Store.
   - **Website Traffic**: Feedly is a very popular service, so **SimilarWeb** or **Ahrefs** can give you accurate web traffic.
   - **Press Statements**: Feedly often announces its milestones, such as **10 million active users** (mentioned in past press releases).

3. **Inoreader**:
   - **Google Play Downloads**: Inoreader has **1M+ downloads** on Google Play.
   - **Website Traffic**: Tools like **SimilarWeb** or **Alexa** can compare its traffic with Feeder and Feedly.
   - **Freemium Insight**: Inoreader’s freemium model might help estimate the proportion of free-to-paid users from interviews or blog posts.

### Conclusion:
- **Google Play/Apple Store** and **SimilarWeb** are the easiest ways to estimate user base size.
- **Traffic comparison tools** like **SimilarWeb** and **Ahrefs** provide a rough estimate of engagement and popularity relative to competitors.
- **Social media**, **public reviews**, and **company press statements** are good indicators of growth milestones.

For a direct comparison between **Feeder**, **Feedly**, and **Inoreader**, I’d recommend starting with **SimilarWeb** for traffic insights and the **Google Play** store for download numbers to get an idea of their relative size.

Both **Inoreader** and **Feedly** are primarily designed to display **RSS feeds**, but they offer some functionality for handling **non-RSS websites** as well. Here’s how they can handle non-RSS websites:

### **Inoreader**
**Inoreader** offers more advanced features compared to Feedly in terms of dealing with non-RSS websites.

- **Web Page Monitoring**: Inoreader has a feature called **Web Page Monitoring**. If a website doesn’t provide an RSS feed, you can still **add it to Inoreader**, and the tool will monitor changes to the page, similar to RSS feeds.
  - **How It Works**: You can track changes on the page (e.g., updates to a blog or news site), and Inoreader will notify you when changes occur, essentially turning non-RSS websites into something you can follow.
  - **Web-to-RSS Conversion**: Inoreader can convert some non-RSS websites into a format that it can display in its layout. It scrapes the content and updates when the page changes.
  
- **Browser Extension**: Inoreader has a browser extension that allows you to subscribe to **any page** or follow non-RSS websites. This feature can be helpful for tracking non-RSS sources in your feed.

### **Feedly**
**Feedly** doesn’t have native support for non-RSS websites, but there are workarounds.

- **Feedly Browser Extension**: Feedly’s extension for **Chrome** and **Firefox** can help you add content to your Feedly feed from websites, even if they don’t offer an RSS feed. However, this is mostly limited to adding specific articles rather than monitoring whole websites for updates.
  
- **Workarounds**: Feedly primarily requires an RSS feed, but you can use services like **RSS.app** or **FiveFilters Feed Creator** to generate RSS feeds from non-RSS websites, which you can then subscribe to via Feedly.

### Conclusion:
- **Inoreader** is the better option if you need to **monitor non-RSS websites** directly, thanks to its **web page monitoring** and **web-to-RSS conversion** features.

If you need to track updates from non-RSS websites, **Inoreader** is the more advanced choice for handling this use case.
