# Prompt

As you may recall from context, I'm working on developing a comprehensive personal knowledge base and documentation system. Some of this documentation is of shared interest to my wife and I. I'm building this on outline. I don't want to share all my documentation wish her, but some of it is common. Can you think  of some systems for creating a family documentation repository / knowledge base?

# Output

Given your goal to develop a family-friendly documentation system while maintaining separate personal knowledge management, here are a few ideas:

### 1. **Separate Personal and Shared Spaces**
   - **Outline Setup**: Use **multiple collections** or **spaces** within Outline, one for your personal documents and one dedicated to shared family documentation.
   - **Permissions**: Adjust permissions so Hannah has access only to the shared space. This way, you can control what is visible to both of you.

### 2. **Family Documentation Repository**
   - **"Rosehill Home Wiki"**: Create a dedicated space named for family-related knowledge, including sections for **home automation**, **emergency contacts**, **recipes**, **household tasks**, and **common projects**.
   - Use **folders** or **sections** like "Smart Home," "Travel Plans," "Household Instructions," and "Health & Safety."

### 3. **Shared Digital Notebook Approach**
   - Consider using **Obsidian Sync**, **Notion**, or **Google Docs** alongside Outline for shared documentation that you both need to update regularly. Sync only relevant folders.

### 4. **Regular Backups and Exports**
   - Automate backups for all shared content to a **common cloud folder** (like Google Drive or Dropbox), ensuring both of you can access essential documents even if Outline is temporarily unavailable.

### 5. **Link Personal and Shared Knowledge**
   - In your **personal Outline**, add **internal links** or references to relevant shared documentation to quickly navigate to it without duplicating content. 

### 6. **Smart Categorization and Tagging**
   - Use **tags** for anything relevant to both of you (e.g., #shared or #family), making it easy to filter or find shared information across both personal and family spaces.

This setup ensures clarity, security, and ease of access, allowing both you and Hannah to contribute to and use the shared knowledge base effectively.
