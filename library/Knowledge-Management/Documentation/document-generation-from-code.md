Generating documents from code can be highly efficient, especially when aiming for standardized outputs. Here are some standard methods:

### 1. **Markdown to Document Conversion**
   - **Tools**: Pandoc, MkDocs, or Jupyter Notebooks.
   - **Method**: Write structured content in Markdown, then convert it to PDF, HTML, or Word using conversion tools. Pandoc, for example, can be scripted to batch-convert multiple files, offering a lot of flexibility.
   - **Use Case**: Technical documentation, reports, user guides.

### 2. **LaTeX Document Generation**
   - **Tools**: TeXShop, Overleaf, or command-line LaTeX.
   - **Method**: Use LaTeX for complex document layouts, scientific papers, or publications. Code scripts (e.g., Python) can dynamically insert data into a LaTeX template.
   - **Use Case**: Academic papers, structured reports, technical manuals.

### 3. **Scripting with Python (Jinja2)**
   - **Tools**: Python, Jinja2 templating engine.
   - **Method**: Write templates in Jinja2 and generate documents by feeding data through Python scripts. This allows the automation of document generation, especially when the content varies (e.g., generating invoices, personalized reports).
   - **Use Case**: Dynamic document creation, templated reports.

### 4. **HTML/CSS to PDF Conversion**
   - **Tools**: wkhtmltopdf, Puppeteer, or PrinceXML.
   - **Method**: Write documents as HTML/CSS and convert them to PDFs. This method allows for styling flexibility and is ideal for web-based documentation that needs to be printable.
   - **Use Case**: Web reports, printable guides, newsletters.

### 5. **Docx Generation with Python Libraries**
   - **Tools**: Python-docx, ReportLab.
   - **Method**: Use Python libraries to programmatically generate `.docx` files. Useful for creating templated Word documents with dynamic content.
   - **Use Case**: Business reports, automated document creation.

### 6. **CSV/JSON to Structured Reports**
   - **Tools**: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib), RMarkdown, Excel macros.
   - **Method**: Write scripts to process data files (like CSV/JSON) and generate structured reports. Automate this with scheduled scripts or services (e.g., using cron jobs).
   - **Use Case**: Data analysis reports, automated dashboards.

These methods allow you to automate document creation, making it easier to maintain consistency, manage updates, and handle large volumes of dynamic content.
