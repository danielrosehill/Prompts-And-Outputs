# Prompt

I have another idea. Let's redesign this so that it's collaborative. Let's imagine 3 people trying this out. Let's cap the session at 45 minutes. And let's devise a structure that alternates between prompting and group discussion about the outputs that have been gathered so far. Could you make a template for this version?

# Output

Certainly! I'd be happy to redesign the "prompting sprints" concept for a collaborative session with 3 people, capped at 45 minutes, and alternating between prompting and group discussion. Here's a template for this collaborative version:

Collaborative Prompting Sprint Template (45 minutes, 3 participants)

1. Preparation (5 minutes)
   - Define the specific problem or challenge to address
   - Set a clear objective for the sprint
   - Briefly share relevant background information
   - Choose the LLM to use (e.g., GPT-4, Claude)
   - Open a shared document or Obsidian vault for collaborative note-taking

2. Sprint Structure (40 minutes)
   - 4 rounds of prompting (5 minutes each)
   - 4 rounds of group discussion (5 minutes each)

3. Round 1: Problem Exploration (10 minutes total)
   a. Individual Prompting (5 minutes)
      - Each participant independently explores the problem with the LLM
      - Focus on broad, open-ended prompts about the problem
      - Save interesting insights and potential angles to explore
   b. Group Discussion (5 minutes)
      - Share key insights from individual prompting sessions
      - Identify common themes or unique perspectives
      - Agree on 2-3 promising angles to explore further

4. Round 2: Solution Brainstorming (10 minutes total)
   a. Individual Prompting (5 minutes)
      - Each participant uses the LLM to generate potential solutions
      - Focus on the angles identified in the previous discussion
      - Save all ideas, even if they seem impractical at first
   b. Group Discussion (5 minutes)
      - Present generated solutions to the group
      - Discuss the merits and potential drawbacks of each idea
      - Select 1-2 solutions for deeper exploration

5. Round 3: Deep Dive (10 minutes total)
   a. Individual Prompting (5 minutes)
      - Each participant explores the chosen solution(s) in more detail
      - Focus on implementation steps, resources needed, and potential challenges
      - Save detailed explanations and insights
   b. Group Discussion (5 minutes)
      - Share findings from the deep dive
      - Identify any conflicting information or gaps in understanding
      - Agree on areas that need further clarification or analysis

6. Round 4: Refinement and Action Planning (10 minutes total)
   a. Individual Prompting (5 minutes)
      - Each participant uses the LLM to address gaps or challenges identified
      - Focus on refining the chosen solution(s) and developing action steps
      - Save refined ideas and concrete next steps
   b. Group Discussion (5 minutes)
      - Present refined solutions and proposed action steps
      - Collectively decide on the final approach
      - Assign initial responsibilities for follow-up actions

7. Wrap-up (5 minutes)
   - Quickly review and organize saved outputs in the shared document
   - Summarize key decisions and action items
   - Schedule a follow-up meeting to review progress and continue discussions

Tips for Effective Collaborative Prompting Sprints:
- Designate a timekeeper to ensure the group stays on schedule
- Encourage all participants to contribute equally during discussions
- Use a shared, real-time document (e.g., Google Docs) for collaborative note-taking
- Consider using breakout rooms if conducting the session virtually
- Rotate the role of discussion facilitator for each round
- Be open to building on each other's ideas during discussions
- Save all potentially useful outputs, even if they don't seem immediately relevant

This collaborative template maintains the intensity of individual prompting while adding the benefits of group discussion and diverse perspectives. The alternating structure allows for both focused work with the LLM and collaborative synthesis of ideas, making the most of the 45-minute timeframe.
