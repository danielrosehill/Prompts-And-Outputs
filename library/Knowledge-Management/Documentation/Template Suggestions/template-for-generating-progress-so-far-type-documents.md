Here’s a **template** you can use for documenting the **progress so far** on any project, summarizing what’s been accomplished, what issues remain, and outlining the next steps for picking up the work the following day. This format is simple and flexible for many types of projects, especially for installations, configurations, or long-running technical tasks.

# **Project Progress Report**

## **Date**:  
- _[Insert current date]_

## **Project Overview**:
- _[Brief description of the project’s objective and overall goals]_  
  (e.g., "Setting up Outline Knowledge Base on GCP for internal knowledge management.")

---

## **Summary of Progress**

### **Accomplished Tasks**:
1. **[Task Title/Component]**:
   - _[Summary of what has been achieved so far]_  
   (e.g., "Successfully set up Docker containers for Outline, PostgreSQL, Redis, and Nginx on a GCP virtual machine.")
   
2. **[Task Title/Component]**:
   - _[Summary of the specific tasks that have been completed today]_  
   (e.g., "Redis and PostgreSQL services are up and connected to the Outline application. SSL configuration for Nginx is in place.")

---

## **Outstanding Issues**

1. **[Issue Title/Component]**:
   - _[Description of unresolved problem]_  
   (e.g., "Outline service is running but still shows 'Continue with Slack' without a fallback login method.")
   
2. **[Issue Title/Component]**:
   - _[Description of unresolved problem]_  
   (e.g., "Nginx configuration issue: 'host not found in upstream' error still appears in logs when accessing through HTTPS.")

---

## **Next Steps/To Do**:
- **Short-Term Focus**:
   1. **[Task 1]**: _[Detailed task to be addressed in the next work session]_  
      (e.g., "Investigate and configure default authentication or Google OAuth for Outline.")
   2. **[Task 2]**: _[Next priority task]_  
      (e.g., "Review and fix Nginx configuration for the reverse proxy to ensure SSL access works correctly.")

- **Long-Term Goals**:
   - _[Any bigger goals or steps further ahead]_  
     (e.g., "Configure additional integrations such as email (SMTP) and complete environment testing.")

---

## **Additional Notes/Resources**:
- _[Any special notes, URLs to documentation, logs, or resources that may be useful for continuing the work]_  
  (e.g., "Refer to Docker logs for Redis connection retries" or "OAuth setup docs: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials")
