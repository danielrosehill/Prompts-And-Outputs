# Prompt

Is it possible to use Obsidian in a split pane view ?

# Output

Yes, **Obsidian** supports split pane view, and it’s one of the core features that makes it highly versatile for note-taking and knowledge management. You can open multiple notes side by side, either vertically or horizontally, within the same workspace.

### How to Use Split Pane in Obsidian:

1. **Opening a Note in Split Pane**:
   - To open a note in a split pane, **right-click** on the note’s title in the file explorer or the tab and select **"Open in new pane."**
   - Alternatively, you can press **Ctrl (Cmd on macOS) + Click** on a note in the file explorer to open it in a new pane.

2. **Manually Splitting a Pane**:
   - **Hover over the pane's tab** (where the title of the note is shown).
   - You’ll see a small **three dots** icon. Click it and choose either **"Split vertically"** or **"Split horizontally"** depending on how you want the new pane to open.

3. **Using the Keyboard Shortcut**:
   - You can split a note pane using the following shortcuts:
     - **Split vertically**: **Ctrl (Cmd) + Shift + V**
     - **Split horizontally**: **Ctrl (Cmd) + Shift + H**

4. **Resizing Panes**:
   - Once you have multiple panes open, you can **resize them** by dragging the divider between the panes.

5. **Linking Panes**:
   - You can also link panes to scroll together or sync content using the **"Linked Panes"** feature, which can be helpful for comparing notes or keeping track of related content.

This split-pane functionality makes Obsidian particularly powerful for workflows where you need to view multiple notes or documents at once, such as comparing GPT outputs or navigating through a "second brain" structure.
