*Note: this repository consists of the outputs of large language models (LLMs). In many cases, these are unedited or minimally edited. The information provided is for demonstrative purposes only and is intended to highlight constraints and capabilities in LLM applications and prompt engineering strategies.*


# Prompt

I'm saving a large and growing collection of LLM outputs in an Obsidian vault. I'm doing this because I wish to save the knowledge. Sometimes, there are specific recommendations and suggestions that are great, but which I would like to look into at a later date. I'm trying to design and institute some kind of logical process for reviewing this large repository of information. Can you think about and suggest some workflows and tools that might help?

# Output

To manage and review a large collection of LLM outputs in Obsidian, you can implement several workflows and use various tools to make the process more efficient and effective. Here's a suggested approach:

## Organizing Your Vault

1. **Folder Structure**: 
   - Create a main folder for LLM outputs
   - Subdivide into categories (e.g., "Recommendations", "Knowledge", "Ideas")

2. **Tagging System**:
   - Use tags to categorize outputs (e.g., #llm-output, #to-review, #implemented)
   - Create topic-specific tags (e.g., #ai-ethics, #coding-tips)

## Capturing and Processing

1. **Template for LLM Outputs**:
   Create a template for new LLM outputs with fields like:
   - Title
   - Date
   - Source/Prompt
   - Key Points
   - Action Items
   - Review Status

2. **Quick Capture**:
   Use the Obsidian mobile app or quick capture plugins to rapidly save outputs[1].

3. **Daily Notes Integration**:
   Link relevant LLM outputs to your daily notes for context[1].

## Review and Action System

1. **Periodic Reviews**:
   - Set up weekly, monthly, and quarterly review notes
   - Use dataview queries to list recently added or unreviewed LLM outputs

2. **Kanban Board for Action Items**:
   Use the Kanban plugin to create a board with columns like "To Review", "In Progress", "Implemented", "Archived"[1].

3. **Task Management**:
   Use the Tasks plugin to track action items extracted from LLM outputs[3].

## Tools and Plugins

1. **Dataview**:
   Create dynamic lists and tables of your LLM outputs based on metadata[3].

2. **Natural Language Dates**:
   Use natural language to set review dates (e.g., "review next week")[3].

3. **Outliner**:
   Organize complex LLM outputs into hierarchical structures[3].

4. **Graph View**:
   Visualize connections between different LLM outputs and your notes.

5. **Smart Random Note**:
   Randomly surface old LLM outputs for review[3].

## Workflow Example

1. **Capture**: Save LLM output using the template.
2. **Quick Process**: Skim and add relevant tags, extract key points and action items.
3. **Weekly Review**: 
   - Review new LLM outputs
   - Move actionable items to Kanban board
   - Link relevant outputs to ongoing projects
4. **Monthly Review**:
   - Assess progress on action items
   - Identify patterns or themes in recent LLM outputs
   - Update long-term projects based on accumulated knowledge
5. **Quarterly Review**:
   - Evaluate the overall value of saved LLM outputs
   - Refine categorization and tagging system
   - Archive or delete outdated or irrelevant information

## Advanced Techniques

1. **Zettelkasten Method**: 
   Create permanent notes from key insights in LLM outputs, linking them to your existing knowledge base[4].

2. **Spaced Repetition**:
   Use plugins like Spaced Repetition to review important LLM-generated knowledge at increasing intervals.

3. **AI-Assisted Review**:
   Experiment with AI plugins or scripts to summarize or highlight key points in your LLM output collection.

By implementing these workflows and tools, you can create a systematic approach to reviewing and actioning the valuable information in your LLM output collection. Remember to regularly refine your system based on what works best for you.
