# Prompt
Based on that calculation how much space do you think 1 million outputs would take up?

# Output
Certainly! Let's scale up our previous calculation to estimate the storage space required for 1 million outputs.





# Large-Scale Obsidian Vault Storage Estimate: 1 Million Outputs

## Recap of Previous Calculation:
- 10,000 files ≈ 60.5 MB

## Scaling to 1 Million Outputs:

1. Basic scaling:
   60.5 MB * (1,000,000 / 10,000) = 6,050 MB

2. Convert to more readable units:
   - 6,050 MB
   - ≈ 6.05 GB (Gigabytes)
   - ≈ 0.00605 TB (Terabytes)

## Additional Considerations for Large-Scale Storage:

1. Indexing overhead may increase slightly with larger vaults
2. Potential for more varied content could affect average file size
3. Large number of files might impact file system performance

## Estimated Range:
To account for variables, let's consider a range:
- Lower estimate: 5.5 GB
- Upper estimate: 6.5 GB



Based on this calculation, 1 million AI outputs in your Obsidian vault would take up approximately 6.05 GB of storage space.

Key points to consider for this large-scale estimate:

1. **Manageable Size**: Even at 1 million outputs, the total storage requirement is quite manageable by today's standards. Most modern computers and certainly cloud storage solutions can easily handle this amount of data.

2. **Local Storage**: This size is still very reasonable for local storage on a modern computer. Even low-end laptops typically come with at least 256 GB of storage, making this vault size (about 2.4% of 256 GB) quite feasible for local syncing.

3. **Cloud Storage**: For cloud solutions like B2, this amount of data is minimal. B2's pricing model would make storing this amount of data very cost-effective.

4. **Syncing Considerations**: While the total size is manageable, syncing 1 million individual files might be slower than syncing the same amount of data in fewer, larger files. However, most modern sync solutions are optimized for handling many small files.

5. **Performance**: Obsidian is designed to handle large vaults, but with 1 million files, you might start to notice some performance impacts, particularly in areas like search or generating graph views. However, this would largely depend on your hardware and how you use Obsidian.

6. **Backup and Transfer**: When backing up or transferring this vault, the large number of small files might make the process slower than dealing with a similar amount of data in larger chunks.

7. **Growth Potential**: Even if your vault grew to 10 million outputs, it would still only be about 60.5 GB, which remains manageable for both local and cloud storage.

8. **Variation**: Remember that this is an average estimate. If your prompts and outputs vary significantly in length, or if you include other types of data (like images or PDFs), the actual size could be larger.

In conclusion, storing 1 million AI outputs in Obsidian is entirely feasible from a storage perspective. The 6.05 GB of data is manageable both locally and in cloud storage. The greater challenge at this scale might be in organizing and navigating such a large number of notes rather than storing them.
