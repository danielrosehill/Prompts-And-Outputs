Yes, all of the mentioned options can work on Fedora Linux. Here’s how you can use each of them:

### 1. **rclone with a GUI Frontend**
   - **rclone:**
     - **Installation:** You can install `rclone` directly on Fedora via the terminal:
       ```bash
       sudo dnf install rclone
       ```
     - **Configuration:** After installation, you can configure `rclone` to work with B2 by following the prompts after running:
       ```bash
       rclone config
       ```

   - **Rclone Browser (GUI):**
     - **Installation:** Although Rclone Browser isn’t available in the Fedora repositories, you can download the AppImage version, which works across Linux distributions:
       - Download the AppImage from the [Rclone Browser GitHub releases page](https://github.com/mmozeiko/RcloneBrowser/releases).
       - Make the AppImage executable:
         ```bash
         chmod +x RcloneBrowser-<version>.AppImage
         ```
       - Run the AppImage:
         ```bash
         ./RcloneBrowser-<version>.AppImage
         ```
     - **Usage:** Once configured, you can use Rclone Browser to manage and sync your Obsidian notes with B2.

### 2. **Cyberduck**
   - **Installation via Flatpak:**
     - **Installation:** Cyberduck is available as a Flatpak package, which you can install on Fedora:
       ```bash
       flatpak install flathub io.cyberduck.Cyberduck
       ```
     - **Usage:** After installation, you can open Cyberduck, set up a connection to your B2 account, and use its GUI to sync your markdown files.

### 3. **Developing a Custom GUI**
   - **Python with Tkinter or PyQt:**
     - **Installation:** Python comes pre-installed on Fedora, and you can install Tkinter and PyQt via:
       ```bash
       sudo dnf install python3-tkinter python3-qt5
       ```
     - **Development:** You can write your Python script using these libraries and test it directly on Fedora.

   - **Electron:**
     - **Installation:** You can install Node.js (which includes npm) on Fedora, then install Electron:
       ```bash
       sudo dnf install nodejs
       npm install -g electron
       ```
     - **Development:** You can develop your Electron-based GUI and run it on Fedora.

### Summary
- **rclone with Rclone Browser** and **Cyberduck** are both great options that work well on Fedora. They require minimal setup and provide a graphical interface for managing your files.
- **Developing a custom GUI** is also fully feasible on Fedora, whether using Python or Electron.

All of these tools and approaches are compatible with Fedora, so you can choose the one that best fits your needs and level of comfort.
