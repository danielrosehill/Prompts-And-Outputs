# Prompt

is there any way in obsidian to jump to the file in the sidebar (folder pane view) that you're currently editing?

# Output

Yes, in **Obsidian**, there is a way to **jump to the file in the sidebar (folder pane view)** that you're currently editing, although it's not completely automated by default. Here are a couple of methods and options to achieve this:

### 1. **Using the "Reveal in Sidebar" Plugin**
The easiest way to achieve this functionality is by using the **"File Tree Alternative Plugin"** or the built-in options provided by other community plugins.

- **File Tree Alternative Plugin**: This plugin enhances the default file navigation capabilities in Obsidian. One of its features is allowing you to **reveal the current note** in the sidebar.
- **How to Use**:
  1. **Install the Plugin**: Open the **Community Plugins** section from the settings and search for "File Tree Alternative."
  2. Once installed, you can use the **"Reveal Active File"** command, which will automatically select and highlight the current file in the sidebar.

### 2. **Obsidian Hotkey for "Reveal in File Explorer"**
Another way is to configure a **hotkey** to quickly reveal the active file:

- **Set Up a Hotkey**:
  - Open **Settings** â†’ **Hotkeys**.
  - Search for the command called **"Reveal active file in navigation"** or **"Show in File Explorer"**.
  - Assign a convenient **hotkey** to this command (e.g., `Ctrl+R`).
  - Once set up, whenever you are editing a file, simply press the assigned hotkey to **jump to that file** in the sidebar.

### 3. **Third-Party Plugin: File Explorer++**
- **File Explorer++** is another plugin that enhances the folder pane view. It helps you to quickly jump to or locate files in the file tree.
- **How to Use**:
  - Search for **File Explorer++** in the Community Plugins and install it.
  - This plugin provides more customization options and may also have the functionality to easily locate the active file in the sidebar.

### 4. **Quick Command Palette Option**
- You can also use **Obsidian's Command Palette** (default shortcut is `Ctrl+P` or `Cmd+P`) and search for:
  - **"Reveal active file in navigation"**.
  - This is a manual way to jump to the file but works well if you don't want to set a dedicated hotkey.

### Summary
- **Hotkey Method**: Set up a hotkey for "Reveal active file in navigation" in the settings for quick access.
- **Plugins**:
  - **File Tree Alternative Plugin**: Adds more functionality for file navigation, including revealing the active file.
  - **File Explorer++ Plugin**: Provides a more enhanced file explorer with similar functionalities.
- **Command Palette**: Use the **Command Palette** (`Ctrl+P`) to find the reveal command manually.

These methods should make it easy to quickly **jump to the current file** in the sidebar/folder pane, providing a more efficient navigation experience when working with a lot of notes in **Obsidian**.
