# Prompt
I'm creating a library of a few scripts that are intended to be used to optimise my Obsidian storage. For instance, one of them reviews all the filenames for invalid characters like question marks and strips them. Could these be considered backends scripts of a kind? And either way, can you help me to think of some way of operating them? By which I mean, it doesn't make sense for me to have to remember to run them manually one by one. I'm trying to think of some way that I can automate their regular operation so that they can (in this example) scrub problematic file names regularly.

# Output
Your approach to optimizing Obsidian storage through scripts is excellent, and these can indeed be considered backend scripts. Automating their operation is a smart move to ensure consistent maintenance of your vault. Let's explore some ways to automate these scripts effectively.

# Automating Obsidian Maintenance Scripts

## 1. Cron Jobs

Use cron to schedule your scripts to run at regular intervals.

Setup:
1. Open terminal and type `crontab -e`
2. Add lines like:
   ```
   0 2 * * * /path/to/your/script1.sh
   0 3 * * * /path/to/your/script2.sh
   ```
3. This runs script1 at 2 AM and script2 at 3 AM daily.

Pros:
- Built into Linux
- Highly flexible scheduling

Cons:
- Requires command line setup
- Scripts run whether or not Obsidian is active

## 2. Systemd Timers

More modern alternative to cron, integrated with systemd.

Setup:
1. Create a service file for each script
2. Create a timer file to trigger the service
3. Enable and start the timer

Pros:
- More features than cron (e.g., randomized delays)
- Better logging and error handling

Cons:
- More complex setup
- Requires root access for system-wide timers

## 3. Obsidian Plugin (Recommended)

Create or use an existing plugin to run your scripts.

Setup:
1. Develop a custom plugin or use "Obsidian Shell Commands"
2. Configure the plugin to run your scripts on a schedule or event

Pros:
- Integrated with Obsidian
- Can run scripts based on Obsidian events
- User-friendly configuration

Cons:
- Requires plugin development or third-party plugin
- Scripts only run when Obsidian is open

## 4. Dedicated Automation Tool

Use a tool like Ansible or Puppet to manage your scripts.

Pros:
- Powerful and flexible
- Can manage complex workflows

Cons:
- Steep learning curve
- May be overkill for simple tasks

## 5. Custom Systemd Service

Create a custom service that runs continuously and executes scripts.

Pros:
- Runs independently of Obsidian
- Can implement complex logic for when to run scripts

Cons:
- Requires more setup and maintenance
- Constantly running service may impact system resources



Based on your needs and the Fedora Linux environment, I recommend a combination of approaches:

1. **Primary Method: Obsidian Plugin**
   - Use or develop a plugin like "Obsidian Shell Commands" to run your scripts.
   - This allows you to trigger scripts based on Obsidian events (e.g., on startup, after a certain period of inactivity, or at scheduled times while Obsidian is running).
   - It provides a user-friendly interface within Obsidian to manage and run your scripts.

2. **Backup Method: Systemd Timers**
   - Set up systemd timers to run your scripts at regular intervals.
   - This ensures your scripts run even when Obsidian isn't active, maintaining your vault's integrity.

Here's a step-by-step plan to implement this:

1. Organize Your Scripts:
   - Place all your maintenance scripts in a dedicated folder, e.g., `~/obsidian-scripts/`.
   - Ensure each script is executable: `chmod +x ~/obsidian-scripts/*.sh`.

2. Set Up Obsidian Plugin:
   - Install "Obsidian Shell Commands" plugin.
   - Configure it to run your scripts:
     - On Obsidian startup
     - Periodically while Obsidian is open (e.g., every 4 hours)
     - When triggered manually through a command palette action

3. Create Systemd Timers (for backup):
   - Create a service file for each script or one service that runs all scripts.
   - Create corresponding timer files to run daily or weekly.
   - Enable and start the timers.

4. Create a Master Script:
   - Write a bash script that runs all your individual scripts in sequence.
   - Use this master script in both the Obsidian plugin and systemd timer configurations.

Example master script (`run_all_maintenance.sh`):

```bash
#!/bin/bash

SCRIPT_DIR="$HOME/obsidian-scripts"

for script in "$SCRIPT_DIR"/*.sh; do
    if [ "$script" != "$0" ]; then  # Avoid running this script itself
        echo "Running $script"
        bash "$script"
    fi
done
```

This setup ensures your scripts run regularly both when you're actively using Obsidian and as a background task, providing comprehensive maintenance of your vault.

Would you like more detailed instructions on setting up any of these components, or do you need help designing the logic for any specific maintenance tasks?## Extracted Prompts
