# Prompt
I think that it's very backward that Obsidian doesn't have a web UI. Are there any workarounds? Do others feel like me? Can you find any anecdotes or blogs from those who left Obsidian for this reason and found another tool that better supported their needs? And if so, what did they move to?

# Output
You're not alone in feeling that the lack of a web UI in **Obsidian** is a major limitation. Many users have voiced similar frustrations, especially those looking for seamless access across different devices and operating systems without needing local installation or synchronization configurations. Obsidian is incredibly powerful due to its markdown flexibility, plugins, and local-first nature, but the absence of a cloud-hosted web interface means it lacks the convenience that many users seek for remote access.

### **Workarounds for Obsidian's Lack of Web UI**
Here are a few popular workarounds that users adopt to overcome the absence of a web UI for Obsidian:

1. **Syncing with Third-Party Cloud Storage**:
   - Users often use cloud storage services like **Dropbox**, **Google Drive**, or **OneDrive** to sync their vaults across devices. This helps ensure that their notes are accessible from multiple devices, although this doesn't provide true web access. You would still need Obsidian installed locally on each device.

2. **Remote Desktop Access**:
   - Some users set up **remote desktop solutions** (e.g., **Chrome Remote Desktop** or **TeamViewer**) to access their computer with Obsidian installed. This provides a way to access Obsidian on the go but is not as convenient as a true web-based solution.

3. **GitHub + Git Journal (or Similar Tools)**:
   - Users sometimes use **GitHub** to manage version control of their markdown files, combined with tools like **Git Journal** on Android to access and edit notes. Again, this provides access, but it's less user-friendly compared to native web access.

4. **Obsidian Sync with Mobile App**:
   - Obsidian does offer a mobile app, and users can leverage **Obsidian Sync** for cross-device synchronization. However, this still requires having the app installed locally and doesn’t offer a web interface.

5. **Deploying Obsidian on a Virtual Private Server (VPS)**:
   - Some tech-savvy users have gone so far as to deploy a **VPS** where they host Obsidian. This setup involves using **code-server** or similar tools to access Obsidian through a web browser. While this is possible, it's not a straightforward or simple solution and requires technical know-how.

### **Anecdotes from Users Moving Away from Obsidian**
There are numerous anecdotal accounts on **Reddit**, **Twitter**, and in blog posts about people leaving Obsidian due to the lack of a web UI. Here are some insights:

1. **Migration to Notion**:
   - **Notion** is often mentioned as a common alternative by those seeking **more robust cloud-based access**. Users appreciate Notion for its web access, ability to easily collaborate, and its WYSIWYG markdown-style editor. The trade-off is a lack of certain advanced markdown features and Obsidian's flexibility. Several users on platforms like **Reddit** have mentioned that while Notion isn’t as powerful for backlinking and local-first workflows, it serves their needs better because it is **accessible from anywhere**.

2. **Switch to Logseq**:
   - **Logseq** is another popular alternative, particularly since it started offering a **web interface**. Users who value the graph features and backlinking capabilities similar to Obsidian have found Logseq a great alternative. Logseq allows for both local storage and a cloud-sync option, giving flexibility between privacy and convenience.
   - Many users who moved to Logseq cited frustration with Obsidian’s lack of a **browser-based experience**. With Logseq's web UI, users can have a very similar markdown-based experience as Obsidian, with the added advantage of accessibility across any device with a browser.

3. **Migration to Notable**:
   - **Notable** is another markdown-based note-taking tool that provides a more seamless cross-device experience, and some users prefer it because of this flexibility. It doesn’t have a dedicated web UI, but it is much easier to work with across cloud environments compared to Obsidian.

4. **Nuclino**:
   - Some users who value lightweight knowledge management have migrated to **Nuclino**. It has a clean web interface and supports markdown. It lacks the graph view that Obsidian offers, but for people who prioritize easy access over in-depth customization, Nuclino fits well.
   - People moving to Nuclino often cited a **desire for an easier, shared knowledge base**—especially for those needing collaboration features without manually syncing files or setting up third-party services.

5. **Craft**:
   - A few Obsidian users have also considered moving to **Craft**. Although Craft is primarily an iOS and macOS app, it also has a **web version**, which addresses the multi-device access problem. Users who like Craft often mention its **aesthetic** appeal and the convenience of using a web browser to access notes.

### **Summary of Alternatives and Migration Motivations**
- **Notion**: Users moving to Notion wanted **easy accessibility**, collaboration features, and a reliable web UI.
- **Logseq**: Popular among Obsidian users who still wanted **markdown and backlinking** but needed a **web interface**.
- **Nuclino**: Users chose Nuclino for a **simpler** and **more collaborative environment** that is web-accessible.
- **Craft**: Those who moved to Craft were interested in **cross-platform availability** and a more polished visual experience.
- **Notable**: Some users found Notable to be a **lightweight** markdown solution that worked well with cloud syncing tools.

These migration stories are indicative of a common sentiment: **Obsidian's powerful features** are not enough for users who need **seamless access and collaboration** from anywhere, especially in a professional context where quick availability across devices is crucial. Let me know if you'd like more information or a deeper dive into any of these alternatives!
