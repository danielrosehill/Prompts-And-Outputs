# Prompt

What cloud based knowledge management or note management apps come closest to replicating Obsidian's functionalities - specifically its markdown support, deep plugin network, and focus on allowing the user to extensively customise the tool

# Output

If you're looking for **cloud-based knowledge management** or **note-taking apps** that come close to replicating **Obsidian's** features—such as **Markdown support**, a **deep plugin network**, and **extensive customization**—here are some of the best options available:

### 1. **Notion**
- **Markdown Support**: Notion does not natively use Markdown, but it allows importing/exporting notes in Markdown format and supports Markdown-style commands.
- **Customization**: It is highly customizable through a block-based structure that allows users to create anything from databases to tables, lists, and boards. However, the level of customizability is not quite as extensive as Obsidian, particularly concerning UI.
- **Plugins & Extensions**: Notion has a growing ecosystem of integrations and community-created templates, though it does not have a plugin network as deep as Obsidian's.
- **Cloud-Based**: Notion is fully cloud-based, which makes it suitable for those seeking access across devices.
- **Summary**: Notion is strong in flexibility and customization of layout, but it's less robust than Obsidian in markdown usage and lacks a deep plugin network.

### 2. **RemNote**
- **Markdown Support**: RemNote is Markdown-based, making it a good fit for those familiar with Markdown-style note-taking.
- **Plugin System**: It has a smaller plugin ecosystem compared to Obsidian but allows users to implement different styles and extensions through custom JavaScript and CSS.
- **Customization**: RemNote offers extensive features for **linking and tagging** notes, similar to Obsidian’s ability to create **bidirectional links**. It is very focused on knowledge retention and integrates spaced repetition well.
- **Cloud-Based**: RemNote is primarily cloud-based, although there are options for local backups.
- **Summary**: RemNote supports deep linking and customization, making it a good match for those looking for something similar to Obsidian but with a focus on **knowledge retention** and **flashcard** creation.

### 3. **Roam Research**
- **Markdown Support**: Roam supports Markdown syntax, although it uses a **block-based** approach for notes.
- **Bidirectional Linking**: Roam’s defining feature is its **networked thought** structure, which resembles Obsidian’s **bidirectional linking**. It excels in outlining and creating connections between notes.
- **Customization & Plugins**: Roam doesn’t have a native plugin store like Obsidian, but users often extend its capabilities with **RoamJS** or **JavaScript-based extensions**. There is an active community that shares extensions and custom scripts.
- **Cloud-Based**: Roam is cloud-based, offering access from anywhere.
- **Summary**: Roam Research is very similar to Obsidian in its **networked note-taking** capabilities but lacks the extensive plugin marketplace. It focuses heavily on outlining and **relational notes**, which suits users looking for interconnected information.

### 4. **Logseq**
- **Markdown Support**: Logseq is Markdown-based and provides a similar experience to Obsidian when it comes to writing and formatting notes in Markdown.
- **Customization and Plugins**: It supports **custom themes** and has a growing **plugin community**. Users can also add custom **CSS** to personalize the interface, much like in Obsidian.
- **Bidirectional Linking**: Logseq offers **bidirectional linking** and a **graph view** similar to Obsidian’s, which allows users to visualize relationships between their notes.
- **Cloud-Based**: Logseq primarily operates locally but offers **syncing capabilities** for a cloud-like experience, allowing you to store your notes in a Git-based system or use the Logseq sync service.
- **Summary**: Logseq is probably the closest match to Obsidian in terms of structure and capabilities, with excellent Markdown support, linking, and a focus on privacy.

### 5. **Tana**
- **Markdown Support**: Tana has limited Markdown support but focuses heavily on outlining and dynamic nodes.
- **Customization & Plugins**: Tana offers custom workflows and has some limited plugins compared to Obsidian’s extensive plugin network.
- **Linking and Customization**: Tana uses a **structured data** approach that allows for a high degree of note connection and categorization. It also has a **graph-based interface** similar to Obsidian's.
- **Cloud-Based**: Tana is entirely cloud-based, which makes it convenient for access from multiple devices.
- **Summary**: Tana provides robust linking capabilities but is still developing compared to the plugin-rich environment of Obsidian. It offers some interesting features for organizing knowledge with data-like nodes.

### Summary Table of Features:

| Feature/Platform      | **Obsidian**       | **Notion**       | **RemNote**      | **Roam Research** | **Logseq**       | **Tana**         |
|-----------------------|--------------------|------------------|------------------|-------------------|------------------|------------------|
| **Markdown Support**  | Full               | Partial          | Full             | Partial           | Full             | Limited          |
| **Bidirectional Links** | Full            | Partial          | Full             | Full              | Full             | Full             |

| **Cloud-Based**       | Local-first, Sync  | Fully Cloud      | Cloud with Backup| Fully Cloud       | Local with Sync  | Fully Cloud      |

### Recommendations:
- **If Markdown and Plugin Support are Key**: **Logseq** is likely the best option, as it offers similar Markdown support, bidirectional linking, and customization options, with a smaller but growing plugin community.
- **If You Need a Cloud-First Solution**: **Roam Research** and **Tana** offer cloud-based solutions with good linking features, but are less customizable compared to Obsidian.
- **For Knowledge Retention**: **RemNote** might be ideal, especially if you need **spaced repetition** features alongside regular note-taking.
- **Balanced Features**: **Notion** is versatile but less focused on Markdown and linking.

If having a **fully cloud-hosted solution** is key, and you still want some of the capabilities that **Obsidian** has, then **Roam**, **RemNote**, or **Logseq (with syncing)** are the closest available options, each with their own strengths in customization and linking capabilities.
