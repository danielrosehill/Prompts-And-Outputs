# Prompt

How about an Obsidian app to copy the text as formatted text rather than markdown?

# Output

If you're using Obsidian and want to copy text as formatted text rather than Markdown, there are some community plugins and approaches you can use to convert your Markdown notes to rich text easily before copying. Here are a few options:

### 1. **Obsidian to Clipboard**
   - **Description**: The **"Copy as HTML"** plugin allows you to copy formatted content from Obsidian directly to your clipboard in a way that retains the formatting. This is useful for pasting into rich text editors like Gmail, Google Docs, or Word.
   - **Installation**:
     1. Open Obsidian settings.
     2. Go to **Community Plugins** and browse.
     3. Search for **"Copy as HTML"**.
     4. Install and enable the plugin.
   - **Usage**: Once installed, use the hotkey or right-click menu to copy your selected Markdown as rich formatted text.

### 2. **Pandoc Plugin**
   - **Description**: **Pandoc** is a universal document converter that can help you copy and paste Markdown as rich text. Using a plugin like **"Pandoc Plugin for Obsidian"**, you can quickly convert the current note to HTML, which is more suitable for copying as rich text.
   - **Installation**: Install the **Pandoc Plugin** from the Community Plugins menu.
   - **Usage**: After converting to HTML via Pandoc, you can copy the rich text output directly into your target application.

### 3. **Markdown Export Utility**
   - **Description**: Use Obsidian's built-in export to **HTML** feature (if available in your version) or third-party plugins that export to rich text formats. This utility allows you to get the note content as formatted text and then copy it to your clipboard.
   - **Usage**: 
     1. Right-click on your note and choose **Export to HTML**.
     2. Open the exported HTML file in your browser and then copy the formatted content.

### 4. **Advanced Obsidian Tricks (Using Preview)**
   - **Description**: A simple approach involves switching to the preview mode in Obsidian and copying the text as it appears formatted.
   - **Usage**:
     1. Switch to the preview mode (`Cmd/Ctrl + E`).
     2. Select and copy the text directly from the preview. Obsidianâ€™s preview mode renders Markdown as rich text, allowing you to paste it elsewhere with the formatting intact.

### 5. **Community Plugin: Rich Copy**
   - **Description**: Some plugins, like **"Rich Copy"**, are designed to add a new command that allows you to copy the current note with rich text formatting preserved.
   - **Installation**:
     1. Open Obsidian, go to **Settings > Community Plugins**.
     2. Search for **Rich Copy**.
     3. Install and enable the plugin.
   - **Usage**: You can activate **Rich Copy** from the command palette (`Cmd/Ctrl + P`) and use it to copy the entire note or selected portions as formatted text.

These plugins and methods provide convenient ways to convert and copy Markdown as rich text without having to manually convert it outside of Obsidian. The **Copy as HTML** plugin or using **Pandoc** are probably the most efficient options if you often need to copy your Markdown notes in a format-friendly way.
