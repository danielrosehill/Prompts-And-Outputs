# Prompt

A concern I have about my Obsidian system is that because it's local first it makes it hard to set up or even just access on new hardware. Let's say that I want to make it easy to get my vault running on a new computer. We can assume it's Linux. I'd need to install Obsidian, set up the plugins, configure my remote sync credentials to hook up to B2, then sync, and only then begin using the vault. Can you think of any way to make this process easier?

# Output

You’re right that setting up an **Obsidian vault** on a new system, particularly a Linux machine, can be a bit cumbersome due to the multiple steps involved—installing Obsidian, setting up plugins, configuring sync, and syncing the vault. However, there are several ways to **automate** or **streamline** the process so that setting up Obsidian on a new device becomes more efficient. Here are some approaches to consider:

### 1. **Automate the Setup with a Bash Script**
   A Bash script can handle the installation of Obsidian, plugins, and the configuration of your sync system. This is ideal for Linux environments and can be customized to include each step of the setup process.

   #### Example Script: Automated Obsidian Setup
   Below is an example of a Bash script that automates the following tasks:
   - Installs Obsidian (via AppImage or Flatpak)
   - Sets up your plugin folder and installs plugins
   - Configures sync with B2 (using `rclone` to sync the vault)

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash

   # Step 1: Install Obsidian (via Flatpak or AppImage)
   echo "Installing Obsidian..."
   flatpak install flathub md.obsidian.Obsidian -y || wget https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-releases/releases/download/v1.0.0/Obsidian-1.0.0.AppImage -O ~/Obsidian.AppImage && chmod +x ~/Obsidian.AppImage

   # Step 2: Set up Obsidian folder and install plugins
   OBSIDIAN_CONFIG_PATH=~/.config/obsidian
   PLUGIN_PATH=$OBSIDIAN_CONFIG_PATH/plugins
   echo "Setting up plugin folder..."
   mkdir -p $PLUGIN_PATH

   # Optional: Set up your plugin preferences by copying a preset configuration
   echo "Downloading plugin config..."
   wget https://your-config-url/obsidian-plugins.zip -O /tmp/obsidian-plugins.zip
   unzip /tmp/obsidian-plugins.zip -d $PLUGIN_PATH

   # Step 3: Install and configure rclone for B2 sync
   echo "Installing rclone for syncing with B2..."
   sudo apt-get install rclone -y
   echo "Configuring rclone..."
   rclone config create b2remote b2 account YOUR_ACCOUNT_KEY key YOUR_APPLICATION_KEY

   # Step 4: Sync your vault from B2
   VAULT_PATH=~/Documents/ObsidianVault
   mkdir -p $VAULT_PATH
   echo "Syncing vault from B2..."
   rclone sync b2remote:your-b2-bucket-name $VAULT_PATH

   echo "Obsidian setup complete. You can now start Obsidian."
   ```

   #### What the script does:
   1. **Installs Obsidian**: The script attempts to install Obsidian via **Flatpak** first, and if that fails, it downloads the **AppImage** version.
   2. **Sets up Plugins**: If you have a predefined plugin setup (stored as a `.zip` file or folder), the script downloads and installs your plugins in the Obsidian configuration folder.
   3. **Syncs with B2**: Uses `rclone` to connect to your Backblaze B2 account, configure the credentials, and then sync your vault.

   #### How to use:
   - Run the script on any new Linux machine, and it will handle the installation and setup process automatically. You can modify the script to fit your specific needs, like adding more plugins, theme setups, or specific settings.

### 2. **Pre-Packaged Dotfiles or Configuration Repository**
   If you frequently set up new environments, you could manage all your Obsidian configuration (plugins, settings, vault sync setup) through a **GitHub or GitLab repository** that holds your **dotfiles** and configuration. This way, you can quickly clone your entire setup onto a new device.

   #### Steps:
   1. **Store Your Obsidian Config in a Git Repository**:
      - Create a repository that stores your Obsidian configuration files (e.g., settings, themes, and plugin configurations).
      - Example:
        - `~/.config/obsidian/` (contains your Obsidian settings and plugin configurations).
   
   2. **Clone and Install**:
      - When setting up a new computer, you can simply clone this repository and set up Obsidian quickly:
      ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/yourusername/obsidian-config.git ~/.config/obsidian
      ```

   3. **Add a Sync Script for Vault**:
      - Include the `rclone` configuration in the same repository or as part of your bash setup script. This way, both your configuration and vault sync can be automated.

   #### Advantages:
   - Your configuration (including settings, plugins, and themes) is **version-controlled** and easy to update across devices.
   - You can always quickly replicate the same setup on any new system.

### 3. **Use AppImage and Sync Configuration**
   You could package Obsidian’s **AppImage** along with a pre-configured **plugin folder** and **sync configuration** into a self-contained environment. The goal here is to bundle everything needed to run Obsidian into a portable, self-contained directory.

   #### Steps:
   1. **Download and Store the AppImage**:
      - Download the Obsidian AppImage to a directory on your new device (or automate this in a script).
   
   2. **Pre-Configure the AppImage**:
      - Inside the same directory as the AppImage, create the necessary configuration files (`~/.config/obsidian/`), plugin folder, and a sync script (e.g., for B2).
   
   3. **Execute Setup**:
      - Write a bash script that runs the AppImage with your pre-configured setup.
      ```bash
      ./Obsidian.AppImage
      ```

   #### Advantages:
   - The AppImage format is portable, so you could store your **Obsidian AppImage** and **configuration files** on a USB drive, a cloud service, or simply clone them via a Git repository. 
   - This approach makes it easy to carry your entire Obsidian setup to different Linux machines without worrying about system-level installations.

### 4. **Leverage Obsidian Sync (Optional Paid Service)**
   If you're willing to consider a more **seamless syncing option**, Obsidian offers its own **Obsidian Sync** service, which eliminates the need for manually configuring rclone or Backblaze B2. It syncs your entire vault, settings, plugins, and themes across multiple devices automatically.

   - **Advantages**:
     - Everything from your notes to your plugins and settings is synchronized across devices.
     - There's no need to set up rclone or Backblaze every time.
   
   - **Disadvantages**:
     - **Paid**: Obsidian Sync is a paid service (about $8/month or $96/year).
     - Less control over where the data is stored (compared to a self-hosted solution like B2).

   Even if you use Obsidian Sync, you could still maintain a **B2 backup** for additional redundancy and security.

### 5. **Create a Self-Hosted Web Version of Your Vault**
   Another way to simplify access to your vault on new hardware is by hosting a **self-hosted web version** of your Obsidian vault. This would allow you to access your vault from any machine with a browser.

   #### Setup:
   - **MkDocs** or **VuePress**: Both MkDocs and VuePress can convert markdown notes into static sites. You could host your vault on a server or local machine and access it via a browser.
   - **Self-Hosted Web Server**: Deploy this static site on your server and access the vault without needing to install Obsidian on every new device.

   #### Advantages:
   - Makes your vault **accessible from any device** without needing to install Obsidian.
   - Still allows for editing your markdown files locally.

   #### Disadvantages:
   - Not a replacement for full Obsidian functionality, as this approach only supports browsing, not rich note-editing within Obsidian.

### Conclusion

To make setting up Obsidian on a new Linux machine easier, you can automate the installation and configuration with a **Bash script**, manage your Obsidian settings and sync setup through **dotfiles** in a Git repository, or create a **self-contained AppImage** setup. If you're open to using a paid service, **Obsidian Sync** could drastically simplify syncing across devices. Additionally, hosting a **web version of your vault** could offer an accessible fallback for viewing and navigating your notes on new machines without full setup.
