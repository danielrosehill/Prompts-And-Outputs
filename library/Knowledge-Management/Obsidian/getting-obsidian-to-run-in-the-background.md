To keep Obsidian running in the background on Android, you can try the following steps:

1. Battery Optimization: Many Android devices automatically restrict apps from running in the background to save battery.

Go to Settings > Battery > Battery Optimization (this might be under a different name depending on your device).

Find Obsidian in the list, and switch it to Don't optimize or Unrestricted. This will prevent the system from shutting it down when it's in the background.



2. App Permissions: Ensure that Obsidian has the necessary permissions to run in the background.

Go to Settings > Apps > Obsidian > Battery or Permissions and make sure background activity is allowed.



3. Device-specific settings: Some Android devices, like Xiaomi, OnePlus, or Huawei, have aggressive battery-saving measures. You may need to whitelist Obsidian from such settings. This could be under Settings > Battery & Performance or Power Management.


4. Third-party apps: If none of the above work, some users utilize third-party apps like Tasker or Automate to ensure that apps continue to run in the background.



These methods should help keep Obsidian running as a background process while you're multitasking.
