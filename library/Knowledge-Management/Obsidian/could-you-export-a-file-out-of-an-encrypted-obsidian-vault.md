# Prompt
A couple of potential issues I can think about with the idea of running Obsidian in an encrypted vault. Let's say that I wanted to export a PDF from it to my desktop to share. Naturally I don't want that file to be encrypted. How would things like that work?

# Output

If you're using **Obsidian** within an encrypted vault (like **Cryptomator**) and you want to export a file (like a **PDF**) to your desktop for sharing in an **unencrypted** format, the process is straightforward, but there are a few considerations depending on how you implement encryption.

### **Using Cryptomator with Obsidian Vault**

1. **Working Inside the Encrypted Vault**:
   - When you're inside the **Cryptomator** vault, Obsidian operates normally, and any files you export (e.g., PDFs, markdown files, images) can be saved **unencrypted** to any location on your system. The files within the vault are encrypted, but once you export them outside the vault, they are in **plaintext**.
   
2. **Exporting a PDF**:
   - If you export a note from Obsidian as a **PDF** (or any other format):
     - **Export location**: You can choose a location **outside** the encrypted vault, like your desktop or another folder on your system, and the file will be unencrypted. This is because the encryption applies **only to the files stored inside the vault**.
     - **Encryption stops at the vault boundary**: Once a file is exported to a location outside the vault, it is treated as a regular, unencrypted file.

3. **How It Works in Practice**:
   - **Step-by-step process**:
     1. **Unlock** your Cryptomator vault and open Obsidian.
     2. **Edit** and manage your notes inside the vault as usual.
     3. When you’re ready to export a note as a **PDF**, go to **Obsidian's export** function and choose to export the file.
     4. **Select a location** outside the encrypted vault (like your desktop or a shared folder) as the export destination.
     5. The exported file will be **unencrypted** and ready for sharing.
   - If you need to keep the file encrypted after exporting, you can later choose to **re-encrypt** it using a tool like **GnuPG** or place it back inside the Cryptomator vault.

### **Using an E2E Plugin in Obsidian**

If you’re using an **end-to-end encryption (E2E) plugin** in Obsidian, the encryption applies only to your notes inside the Obsidian app. When you export a file (e.g., a **PDF**), the exported file will **not be encrypted** unless you explicitly encrypt it afterward.

- **Exporting with an E2E Plugin**:
  - If a note is encrypted within Obsidian using an E2E plugin, the note itself is stored encrypted within the vault, but once you export it (to PDF or another format), the exported file will be in **plaintext** unless you choose to encrypt it manually afterward.
  - The file is no longer subject to Obsidian's encryption once it’s exported, and it will be readable without decryption.

### **Considerations for File Export and Security**:

1. **Managing Sensitive Data**:
   - If you export sensitive data (e.g., a **PDF** containing personal information), you need to be aware that once it’s outside the encrypted vault, it’s no longer protected. To mitigate this:
     - **Delete** the file after sharing or when it's no longer needed.
     - **Manually encrypt** the file before sharing if you want to maintain its confidentiality (using a tool like **GnuPG** or **VeraCrypt**).
   
2. **File Integrity and Version Control**:
   - If you're working with versioned notes or collaborative documents, always ensure that the **exported version** is the latest or final version before sharing it. Once the file is outside the encrypted vault, any further changes won't be reflected back in your encrypted Obsidian vault.

3. **Workflow Considerations**:
   - **Copy-pasting plaintext**: Another simple option for sharing information securely is to copy text from Obsidian and paste it into a **plaintext document** outside the vault, which ensures that only the necessary content is exposed outside the encrypted environment.
   - **Automating workflows**: If you frequently export notes or documents, consider automating the process with scripts that handle **file transfer** and **manual encryption** as needed.

### **Summary: How It Works**
- **Encrypted Vault (Cryptomator)**: Files are encrypted only while they are inside the Cryptomator vault. When you export a file from Obsidian (e.g., a PDF), the file outside the vault is **unencrypted** and can be shared freely.
- **E2E Plugin in Obsidian**: The plugin encrypts your notes inside Obsidian. However, when you export a file (e.g., a PDF), the export will be **unencrypted**, and the file can be shared freely unless you encrypt it manually afterward.
  
In either case, you can safely export files in plaintext as long as you ensure that they are handled appropriately after they leave the encrypted environment.
