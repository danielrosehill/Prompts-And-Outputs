# Prompt

In Obsidian is there a way to just search through your folders (excluding individual files)?

# Output

**Summary**: You asked if there’s a way in Obsidian to search only through folders, excluding individual files.

In Obsidian, there isn't a native feature to directly search through just folder names, but here are a couple of workarounds that may help:

1. **Use Folder Aliases or Naming Conventions**:
   - If you prefix all folder names with a unique symbol (e.g., `_foldername` or `#foldername`), you can then search for that prefix in the search bar. This will help you filter results to show only items with that unique prefix, effectively showing folders if the convention is applied consistently.

2. **Advanced URI Scheme**:
   - Obsidian’s URI scheme can be used to navigate directly to folders, though it doesn’t provide search filtering. If you commonly navigate to certain folders, you can create links to those folders within a note for quick access, bypassing the need to search.

3. **Community Plugins**:
   - Plugins like **Obsidian File Explorer Alternative** or **Quick Explorer** offer enhanced navigation and may allow you to focus more on folder structures rather than individual files.
   - **Dataview**: While not strictly a search tool, Dataview can be used to generate a list of folders in your vault. You can create a Dataview query to show only folders, which you could then reference as a sort of "folder index."

These methods offer some ways to work around the limitation, though they aren't direct folder-only search solutions. Let me know if you’d like guidance on any specific approach!
