# Prompt

How do I set up an Obsidian workspace? Any plugins that might help / which are geared towards setting up grid configs like this? I'm going for a kind of full screen dashboard type feel!

# Output

To set up an Obsidian workspace with a grid configuration for a full-screen dashboard feel, you can use a combination of built-in features and community plugins. Here's how you can implement this:

## Using Built-in Features

   - Enable the Workspaces core plugin in Obsidian settings.
   - This allows you to save and load different workspace layouts[4].

   - Arrange these splits to create a grid-like layout.

## Recommended Plugins

   - This plugin is specifically designed for creating grid-based dashboards[2].
   - Features:
     - Flexible grid configurations (1x2, 2x2, 3x3, etc.)
     - Embed vault files, code blocks, or external URLs in each grid container
     - Easy-to-use interface for setting up your dashboard

2. **Dataview Plugin**:

## Implementation Steps

1. **Install Plugins**:

2. **Create Dashboard File**:
   - Right-click in a folder and select "New dashboard" or click the gauge icon in the left sidebar[2].

3. **Choose Grid Layout**:
   - Use the dropdown in the upper right corner to select your desired grid layout (e.g., 2x2)[2].

4. **Add Content to Grid**:
   - In each container, click the embed buttons to add content:
     - Vault files
     - Code blocks (including Dataview queries)
     - External links[2]

5. **Customize with CSS** (Optional):
   - Use custom CSS to further style your dashboard and enhance the grid-like appearance[4].

6. **Set Up Workspaces**:
   - Once you have your dashboard layout, use the Workspaces core plugin to save this configuration.
   - You can then easily load this dashboard layout whenever needed[4].

7. **Full-Screen Mode**:
   - Use Obsidian's full-screen mode to maximize the dashboard experience.

By combining these features and plugins, you can create a powerful, customized dashboard that fits your specific needs and provides a full-screen, grid-based layout for efficient information management and access.
