# Prompt

So I've found Obsidian really helpful for getting my life organised. It's been great to have all my thoughts in one place. I'm currently using Google Drive in conjunction with it and I don't like fragmenting knowledge and info across various systems, so I've been thinking about ways of consolidating this new system. I have thought about simply moving everything onto Obsidian. Right now, I capture LLM outputs but I could extend that to drafting personal documents. But there are some problems. For one, Obsidian doesn't really work with non-markdown files. I can do things like create tasks lists as documents. But they're not *really* tasks lists in the sense that they can't easily synced or kept a record of. The strength of the system for me is that it's document-centric. I'm wondering if there are any other systems out there which based themselves around the document but which are a bit more flexible in terms of what kind of information can be managed. Another shortcoming of Obsidian that prevents me from extending it is the fact that it's local-first. I would definitely prefer whatever systems I use to be easily cloud-accessible.

# Output

Considering your needs—a document-centric system with cloud accessibility and flexibility beyond Markdown—here are some options that might align well:

### 1. **Notion**
   - **Structure**: Notion is document-focused, with support for a wide range of content types, including Markdown, tables, task lists, and databases.
   - **Cloud Accessibility**: It’s entirely cloud-based, so you can access it from any device with a network connection.
   - **File Compatibility**: It supports embedding various file types (e.g., PDFs, images, videos) directly in documents, though editing is limited.
   - **Task Management**: Offers native task management with linked databases, enabling task lists, due dates, reminders, and tracking.
   - **Pros/Cons**: Very flexible and integrates multiple file types, but lacks the local-first approach that Obsidian offers.

### 2. **OneNote (Microsoft)**
   - **Structure**: OneNote is document-centric and allows a flexible, notebook-style organization. It’s a good hybrid of free-form and structured note-taking, supporting rich-text notes, drawings, and attachments.
   - **Cloud Accessibility**: Synchronizes across devices through OneDrive, making it very accessible.
   - **File Compatibility**: Embeds various file types (including Office files) and supports in-document file viewing and annotations.
   - **Task Management**: Integrates with Microsoft To-Do, enabling more dynamic task tracking than static lists.
   - **Pros/Cons**: Excellent for free-form notes and various attachments but can feel less streamlined for task management compared to Obsidian’s plugin-driven simplicity.

### 3. **Coda**
   - **Structure**: Document-centric with built-in databases, tables, and various custom views for organizing notes, tasks, and knowledge.
   - **Cloud Accessibility**: Coda is cloud-based, providing easy access across devices.
   - **File Compatibility**: Handles text and tasks well, though file handling (like PDFs and large attachments) isn’t as robust.
   - **Task Management**: Offers strong task management capabilities with relational databases, formulas, and templates.
   - **Pros/Cons**: Very flexible, particularly with structured data, but might lack the Markdown simplicity you’re accustomed to with Obsidian.

### 4. **Evernote (Recent Versions)**
   - **Structure**: Allows document and note-centric organization with notebooks and tags.
   - **Cloud Accessibility**: Easily accessible via the cloud with web and mobile apps.
   - **File Compatibility**: Supports attaching various file types, web clipping, and note linking.
   - **Task Management**: Offers in-note tasks, reminders, and even integrations with calendar apps.
   - **Pros/Cons**: Easy to use with good cross-platform compatibility, though recent changes in structure have made it feel less versatile to some power users.

### 5. **Dropbox Paper or Google Workspace for Notes and Knowledge Base**
   - **Structure**: Both can serve as document-based workspaces with support for embedding various content types and collaboration.
   - **Cloud Accessibility**: Both are entirely cloud-first, so they work seamlessly across devices.
   - **File Compatibility**: Google Workspace, in particular, is very flexible with attachments and document types, while Dropbox Paper supports multimedia and some file types natively.
   - **Task Management**: Google Tasks can be integrated to handle task tracking and reminders.
   - **Pros/Cons**: They don’t match the Markdown-centric focus of Obsidian but can serve as versatile knowledge bases.

You might also consider **Logseq**, which is Markdown-compatible and has better task management than Obsidian, or **RemNote**, which has spaced repetition features and cloud access, though it’s primarily note-focused and may not yet match Obsidian’s versatility in document management. Each of these systems has strengths, so one approach might be to trial a few to see which best aligns with your knowledge management and accessibility needs.
