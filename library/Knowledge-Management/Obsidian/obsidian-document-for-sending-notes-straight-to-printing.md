# Prompt

are there any obsidian shortcuts that can send a document straight to a print queue?

# Output

Currently, **Obsidian** doesn't have a built-in shortcut or direct function to send a document straight to the print queue. However, there are a few ways you can work around this using Obsidian's existing features or third-party plugins:

### 1. **Print via Browser or Export PDF**:
   You can export your document as a PDF and then print it.
   - **Step 1**: Open the document in Obsidian.
   - **Step 2**: Use the shortcut **Ctrl+P** (Cmd+P on macOS) to open the "Print" dialog.
   - **Step 3**: Select "Print to PDF" or your printer directly from the dialog that opens.

### 2. **Third-Party Plugins**:
   - Plugins like **Advanced Obsidian Export** allow more control over exporting notes, which could include export to PDF for easy printing.
   - **Command Palette**: You can open the Command Palette (Ctrl+P) and search for "Export to PDF" to simplify the workflow.

### 3. **Use a Custom Hotkey**:
   You can create custom key bindings for commands like "Export to PDF" in **Settings > Hotkeys** to make the process faster, and from there, you can quickly send the PDF to your printer.

At this time, there isn't a direct print shortcut built into Obsidian that sends notes straight to a print queue, but combining hotkeys with the built-in "Export to PDF" or using plugins will get you close to that functionality.
