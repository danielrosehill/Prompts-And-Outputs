# Prompt

Please come up with a detailed backup plan focused on how I should maximise the safety of my Obsidian vault. Currently the vault is stored in B2 with syncs down to local clients. Focus on providing a robust backup approach. Targets you may wish to consider are my NAS and (possibly) another cloud storage bucket. Focus on ensuring that there is redundant access to the vault

# Output

Here’s a refined backup strategy tailored to your context, where you have access to both a **Synology NAS** and an **Ubuntu VM**. This plan will balance redundancy and flexibility without over-complicating the backup system, focusing on keeping your Obsidian vault safe, accessible, and easy to restore.

### **1. Backup Strategy Overview:**
We'll implement a **3-2-1 backup strategy**, which means:
- **3 copies** of your data: One primary and two backups.
- **2 different types of storage**: Local (NAS) and cloud (B2 or another cloud provider).
- **1 offsite backup**: Ensuring a backup outside your main environment.

### **2. Backup Targets:**
- **Primary**: Your current B2 cloud storage will remain the primary cloud backup.
- **Local Backup**: Use your **Synology NAS** as the local backup destination.
- **Secondary Offsite**: A backup to a second cloud storage provider (optional, if you want to maximize redundancy).

We'll focus on using **Synology NAS** as your main local backup, syncing with B2 for redundancy. The **Ubuntu VM** can be used as a backup management tool if you need more control over automating these processes.

### **3. Detailed Backup Plan**

#### **Step 1: Backup to Synology NAS**
This will be your main local backup system for faster restores.

1. **Set up Synology Hyper Backup**:
   - **Use Hyper Backup**: Synology’s Hyper Backup is a versatile tool for incremental and versioned backups.
   - **Backup Destination**: Create a dedicated folder on your NAS for your **Obsidian vault** backups.
   - **Frequency**: Schedule daily backups to ensure that the latest version of your vault is stored on your NAS.
   - **Retention Policy**: Configure versioning to keep daily backups for 30 days, and weekly backups for up to 6 months. This allows you to restore an older version if needed.

2. **Rsync or Syncthing**:
   - If you prefer a simple solution, you can use **rsync** to automate the sync between your local clients (where the vault is stored) and the Synology NAS.
   - For real-time syncing, **Syncthing** can be configured to continuously sync changes to the NAS folder.
   - **Backup Frequency**: Set this to run hourly or daily depending on the size of the vault and the frequency of changes.

3. **Encrypt the Backup**:
   - Use **Synology’s encryption features** to secure the data at rest on the NAS, particularly if it’s accessible via the network.

#### **Step 2: Backup to Secondary Cloud (B2 + Optional Secondary Cloud Provider)**
Maintain your current **B2** backup, and optionally consider adding a second cloud provider for maximum redundancy.

1. **B2 Cloud Backup**:
   - **Continue syncing**: Use your existing workflow to keep the Obsidian vault synced with Backblaze B2.
   - **Frequency**: Use continuous syncing or schedule backups to B2 at least **twice a day**. This ensures cloud redundancy and protects against local hardware failure or disasters.
   - **Versioning**: Enable versioning in B2 to retain several versions of your vault, especially important for recovering from accidental deletions or file corruption.

2. **Add a Secondary Cloud Backup (Optional)**:
   - **Cloud Provider**: Consider adding **AWS S3**, **Wasabi**, or **Google Cloud Storage** for an additional layer of redundancy. You can set this up with **Rclone** for flexible syncing and encryption.
   - **Backup Frequency**: Configure a daily or weekly backup to the secondary cloud provider.

#### **Step 3: Leverage Ubuntu VM for Automation and Monitoring**
Use your **Ubuntu VM** to automate and manage your backup processes.

1. **Rclone for Cloud Sync**:
   - Install **Rclone** on your Ubuntu VM to automate syncing between your NAS and cloud services (B2 or any secondary provider).
   - Schedule **cron jobs** to perform these backups at specified intervals (daily for cloud, more frequent for the NAS).

2. **Monitoring Backups**:
   - Set up **Healthchecks.io** or similar tools on your Ubuntu VM to monitor backups. You’ll receive alerts if a backup fails, ensuring that no issues go unnoticed.

3. **Encrypting Backups on Ubuntu**:
   - If using the Ubuntu VM as a local backup location for critical data, ensure the vault data is encrypted with tools like **Veracrypt** or **GPG**.

#### **Step 4: Regular Testing and Monitoring**
1. **Test Restores**:
   - Periodically test restoring your vault from the NAS and the cloud (B2 or secondary) to verify that the backups are functional and complete. Do this at least once a month.
   
2. **Monitoring and Alerts**:
   - Use your Ubuntu VM or NAS’s built-in notification system to set up alerts for failed or incomplete backups.

### **4. Backup Frequency Summary**
Here’s a breakdown of recommended frequencies for each backup location:

- **Primary (B2)**: Continuous syncing or **twice daily** backups.
- **Synology NAS**: **Hourly or daily** sync, with versioning retained for up to 6 months.
- **Secondary Cloud (Optional)**: **Daily or weekly** backup, depending on your redundancy needs.

---

### **Conclusion:**
This approach ensures that your **Obsidian vault** is secured across multiple platforms with automated, incremental backups. The **Synology NAS** acts as a reliable local backup, while **B2** provides cloud redundancy. The **Ubuntu VM** can automate these processes and ensure real-time monitoring, allowing you to recover the vault quickly in the event of failure. Regular testing will ensure that these backups are ready when needed.
