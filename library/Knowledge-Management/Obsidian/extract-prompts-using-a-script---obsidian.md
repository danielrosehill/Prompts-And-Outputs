# Prompt

Let's revisit the idea of using a python script to automatically extract the prompts I've renamed the prompts folder Prompts and the outputs folder Outputs In the outputs I format like this # Prompt prompttext # Output outputtext So prompttext in this example should be copied into the Prompts folder and given a file name that corresponds to the one of the output Can you write a script that tries to do this?

# Output

Here's a Python script that will automate the extraction of the `Prompt` section from your notes in the `Outputs` folder and save it as a new file in the `Prompts` folder. The script will use the filename of the output file as the basis for the prompt filename.

### Python Script

```python
import os
import re

# Paths to your Obsidian folders
output_folder = '/path/to/your/obsidian/vault/Outputs'
prompts_folder = '/path/to/your/obsidian/vault/Prompts'

# Create the prompts folder if it doesn't exist
os.makedirs(prompts_folder, exist_ok=True)

# Iterate through all markdown files in the Outputs folder
for root, dirs, files in os.walk(output_folder):
    for file in files:
        if file.endswith('.md'):
            file_path = os.path.join(root, file)
            with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
                content = f.read()
                
                # Regex to extract the Prompt section
                match = re.search(r'# Prompt\n(.+?)\n# Output', content, re.DOTALL)
                if match:
                    prompt_text = match.group(1).strip()
                    
                    # Create a new filename for the prompt based on the output file name
                    prompt_file_name = f"{file.replace('.md', '')}_prompt.md"
                    prompt_file_path = os.path.join(prompts_folder, prompt_file_name)
                    
                    # Write the prompt text to a new markdown file in the Prompts folder
                    with open(prompt_file_path, 'w') as prompt_file:
                        prompt_file.write(f'# {file.replace(".md", "")} Prompt\n\n{prompt_text}')
                    
                    print(f"Extracted and saved prompt to {prompt_file_path}")
                else:
                    print(f"No prompt found in {file_path}")

print("All prompts have been processed.")
```

### How the Script Works:
1. **Folder Paths**: Replace `'/path/to/your/obsidian/vault/Outputs'` and `'/path/to/your/obsidian/vault/Prompts'` with the actual paths to your Obsidian folders.

2. **Regex Pattern**: The script uses a regular expression to find the text between `# Prompt` and `# Output`. It then extracts this `prompttext`.

3. **File Naming**: The script names the new prompt file based on the original output file name, appending `_prompt.md` to the name.

4. **File Creation**: It creates a new markdown file in the `Prompts` folder containing the extracted prompt text.

5. **Error Handling**: If the script doesnâ€™t find a `# Prompt` section, it will print a message and skip that file.

### How to Run:
1. Save the script as `extract_prompts.py`.
2. Make sure you have Python installed.
3. Run the script from your terminal:
   ```bash
   python extract_prompts.py
   ```

This script will go through all the markdown files in your `Outputs` folder, extract the prompts, and save them into the `Prompts` folder with corresponding filenames. This should streamline your process and help keep your prompts organized efficiently in Obsidian.## Extracted Prompts
