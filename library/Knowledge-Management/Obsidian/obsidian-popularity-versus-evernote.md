Obsidian has grown significantly in popularity, especially among users who prioritize flexibility, privacy, and the ability to fully customize their note-taking experience. It’s particularly popular with tech-savvy users, knowledge workers, and those who appreciate Markdown and linking features for creating a "second brain" or personal knowledge management (PKM) system. Its offline-first design and plugin ecosystem have made it a strong competitor in the notes management space, even though it has a more niche appeal than more established apps like Evernote.

In terms of user base, Evernote historically had a much larger following, as it has been around since 2008 and marketed to a broader audience. However, over time, some users have shifted away from Evernote due to concerns about performance issues, changes in pricing models, and the need for more control over their data. Many of these users have found Obsidian to be a compelling alternative because of its local-first approach, extensibility, and ability to integrate seamlessly with other tools like Git, external storage, and even cloud services if desired.

So, while Obsidian’s user base is likely smaller than Evernote’s, it is steadily growing, particularly among those who value customization and privacy. Its rise also coincides with dissatisfaction among some of Evernote's original user base.

Would you like to explore specific features of Obsidian that have driven its growth, or perhaps compare them to Evernote's features?
