# Prompt

can you suggest a plugin that would allow me to add comments to the notes I'm saving in Obsidian. I'd like to be able to leave comments for myself in the sidebar - similar to how you can do this in Google Docs.

# Output

To achieve a **Google Docs-like commenting system** in Obsidian, where you can leave comments for yourself in a sidebar, there are a few plugins that can help replicate this feature, although Obsidian doesn't have native sidebar comments like Google Docs. Here are the best options for adding comments or annotations to your notes:

### 1. **Obsidian Comments Plugin**
This plugin allows you to add comments within your notes using a specific syntax that won't show up when viewing or exporting your notes. It's lightweight and integrates directly into your markdown notes.

You can add comments like this:
```markdown
%% This is a comment and won't be visible in preview mode %%
```

While this isn't a sidebar solution, it helps keep your comments separate from the content in the editing mode.

### 2. **Obsidian Annotations Plugin**
This plugin allows you to leave annotations or notes attached to specific parts of your documents. It's more robust and closer to Google Docs' comment feature. You can highlight text and add notes, which are displayed in a sidebar or as a pop-up when you hover over the highlighted text. This allows for more complex, detailed comments.

### 3. **Obsidian Hover Editor Plugin**
The **Hover Editor** plugin can be used to create "hoverable" notes or comments. You can hover over text to reveal notes and thoughts about that section. This isn't exactly like a sidebar comment system, but it can work for leaving inline comments that don't clutter your main note. 

### 4. **Obsidian Side Comments Plugin**
This plugin is designed to provide a Google Docs-style comment system, specifically adding a sidebar where you can leave comments or discussions next to your notes. This can be a great solution for adding self-comments or notes next to the primary content of your Obsidian notes, and it works in a non-intrusive way.

### 5. **Obsidian Review Plugin**
This plugin is geared toward creating a review process, where you can leave notes and review comments on sections of text. It works by creating a linked "review note" where comments are stored. This provides some separation from your main content while still giving you a way to track thoughts or ideas.

### 6. **Obsidian Tasks Plugin**
Though not specifically for comments, you can use the **Tasks** plugin to leave "comment-like" TODOs in your notes. You can create a list of items to review, annotate, or comment on later. These tasks are searchable and can be pulled into a dashboard.

### 7. **Canvas Plugin**
If you're looking for a way to add more structured comments, **Obsidian's Canvas plugin** could be a good alternative. You can create separate "cards" for your notes and comments on a visual board layout, and link them together. It's a more visual approach but allows you to comment on specific sections and have those comments displayed in a structured manner next to your main note.

### Summary of Suggested Plugins:
- **Obsidian Comments**: Simple comment-like feature in your markdown notes.
- **Obsidian Annotations**: Highlight and add side notes or comments to sections.
- **Obsidian Hover Editor**: Add hoverable notes and comments to your content.
- **Obsidian Side Comments**: Provides a Google Docs-style sidebar for comments.
- **Obsidian Review**: Create a linked review note for tracking comments.
- **Obsidian Tasks**: Use tasks as inline comments or reminders.
- **Canvas Plugin**: Visual note-taking with comment cards for more complex annotations.

For a feature closest to Google Docs, I'd recommend trying the **Obsidian Side Comments** plugin.

Would you like help setting up any of these plugins?

# Input

Great finds, thank you. Which of these would you say has the biggest user base and the most support?

# Output

Among the plugins mentioned, **Obsidian Comments** and **Obsidian Annotations** are commonly used, but the plugin with the **largest user base** and **strongest support** would likely be:

### **Obsidian Tasks Plugin**
- **User base**: Obsidian Tasks is a highly popular plugin, widely used by the Obsidian community for task management, but many users creatively use it to leave "comment-like" reminders or notes within their documents. Since it's multifunctional, it enjoys a large user base.
- **Support**: The Obsidian Tasks plugin is actively maintained, with regular updates and contributions from the community. It has robust documentation and many users share tips and integrations, meaning you'll find ample support if you run into issues.

### **Obsidian Annotations Plugin**
- **User base**: The Annotations plugin has a moderate user base and is well-liked by those who want to leave detailed notes on specific sections of their documents.
- **Support**: While not as widely used as Tasks, it has good support within the community, particularly among academic users and note-takers who rely on detailed, structured annotations.

### **Obsidian Comments Plugin**
- **User base**: This is one of the more lightweight solutions and is widely used by users who prefer keeping comments within their markdown files in a non-intrusive way.
- **Support**: It's simple and straightforward, with enough user traction to find support and tips.

### **Side Comments Plugin**
- **User base**: This plugin is newer and geared specifically toward mimicking Google Docs-like commenting. While it’s still growing, it shows a lot of potential due to the demand for this functionality.
- **Support**: As it’s relatively new, support might not be as extensive, but given the community’s interest, it's worth keeping an eye on for future growth.

### Conclusion:
If you want the **most widely supported and versatile plugin**, I recommend starting with **Obsidian Tasks** because of its large user base and constant updates. However, if you're specifically looking for **Google Docs-style sidebar comments**, **Side Comments** could be a solid choice, though it might have a smaller but growing user base.
