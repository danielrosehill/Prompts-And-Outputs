# Prompt

Please provide some tips on keeping Obsidian fast and performant when using it to manage notebooks with lots (thousands) of notes. Does the note size inherently slow the system down at a certain point? Are there any plugins that are especially recommended when managing larger vaults?

# Output

When managing large Obsidian vaults with thousands of notes, performance can become a concern. Here are some tips to keep Obsidian fast and performant:

## Optimize Note Structure

1. **Note Size**: While note size doesn't inherently slow down the system significantly, extremely large notes (e.g., over 100KB) can impact performance. Consider breaking down very large notes into smaller, interconnected ones.

2. **Atomicity**: Aim for atomic notes - small, focused notes on single topics. This can improve search speed and overall performance.

## Plugin Management

1. **Limit Plugins**: The number of active plugins directly impacts performance. Only enable plugins you actively use[4].

2. **Plugin Performance**: Some plugins are more resource-intensive than others. Be particularly cautious with plugins that:
   - Continuously run background processes
   - Modify the editor in real-time
   - Perform complex calculations on your entire vault

3. **Regular Updates**: Keep your plugins updated to benefit from performance improvements.

## Recommended Plugins for Large Vaults

1. **Dataview**: Efficient for querying and displaying information from large vaults[3].

2. **Quick Switcher**: Helps navigate large vaults quickly[2].

3. **Outliner**: Useful for organizing complex hierarchical structures in large vaults.

4. **Folder Note**: Helps manage folder structures in large vaults more effectively.

## System Optimization

1. **Search Indexing**: Obsidian's search can be slow on first load with large vaults. Consider using SSD storage for faster indexing.

2. **Regular Cleanup**: Periodically remove unused attachments, notes, and plugins.

3. **Sync Considerations**: If using sync, consider a service with block-level sync like Dropbox or OneDrive for better performance[3].

## Vault Management

1. **Multiple Vaults**: Consider splitting very large vaults into multiple smaller ones if they cover distinct topics.

2. **Folder Structure**: Organize notes into a logical folder structure to improve navigation and potentially speed up certain operations.

3. **Use Workspaces**: Create workspaces for different projects or areas to limit the active working set of notes.

## Performance Monitoring

1. **Startup Time**: Monitor your vault's startup time. If it becomes excessive, consider optimizing or splitting the vault.

2. **Graph View**: Large vaults can make the graph view laggy. Use it sparingly or consider plugins that optimize its performance.

Remember, Obsidian has been stress-tested with up to 20,000 notes[1], so with proper management, you can maintain good performance even with thousands of notes. However, the exact performance will depend on your specific hardware, note structure, and plugin usage.
