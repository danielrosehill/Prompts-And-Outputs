# Prompt

Let's say that I keep building up this collection of markdown outputs in Obsidian. Can you think of some other programs that would be easy to migrate this library to? Perhaps other note managers? I am eager to avoid locking myself into this tool indefinitely, although there are features of it that i Like

# Output
It's smart to think ahead about portability and avoiding vendor lock-in, especially when building a large collection of markdown-based notes. Here are some other programs and note managers that are markdown-friendly and offer easy migration paths from Obsidian:

     - Git integration for version control.
     - Can handle very large projects and files.

   - **Features**:
     - Live preview of markdown content, blending the editing and reading experience.

   - **Migration**:
     - Typora opens and edits markdown files directly, so your existing Obsidian vault can be used without changes.

### **Portability Tips:**
   - **Use Standard Markdown**: Stick to standard markdown features that are supported across all platforms. Avoid Obsidian-specific syntax (like `![[links]]` or complex dataview queries) if portability is a concern.
   - **Avoid Proprietary Features**: Use tools and plugins that store data in a standard, portable format rather than in app-specific databases.
   - **Regular Backups**: Keep regular backups of your markdown files to ensure that if you decide to move to another platform, your data is ready for migration.

By keeping these points in mind, you can ensure that your notes remain accessible and easy to migrate to other systems, giving you the flexibility to choose the best tool for your needs at any time.## Extracted Prompts
