# Prompt

I need to go back through a large amount of obsidian notes and mark up some as technical plans for actioninging. There are about 1,500 notes. Does Obsidian have any plugins or recommended tools for reviewing notes in bulk?

# Output

Obsidian offers a few plugins and workflows that can help you efficiently review and mark up large volumes of notes. Here are some tools and approaches that would be useful:

### 1. **Dataview Plugin**:
   - **Dataview** allows you to query and organize notes based on metadata (like tags, frontmatter, or even specific content within notes).
   - You can create custom views to list all notes with certain characteristics (e.g., notes that contain keywords like "plan" or "action"). This will help you quickly review and identify which notes are relevant for technical plans.
   - Example Dataview Query:
     ```dataview
     table file.mtime as "Modified", file.size
     from "your-folder-name"
     where contains(tags, "plan")
     sort file.mtime desc
     ```

### 2. **Tagging and Custom Frontmatter**:
   - As you go through your notes, you can tag relevant ones with something like `#action-plan` to easily retrieve them later.
   - Alternatively, you can add custom frontmatter fields (YAML) to notes. For example:
     ```yaml
     ---
     status: "actionable"
     ---
     ```
     Then, you can use Dataview to query all notes with the `status: actionable` field.

### 3. **Advanced URI Plugin**:
   - This plugin enables you to create bulk actions across multiple notes by allowing links to open multiple notes or execute specific actions within Obsidian.
   - You can potentially automate marking certain notes by running specific commands across all notes containing certain keywords or tags.

### 4. **Obsidian Outliner**:
   - If your notes have a structured format (e.g., bullet points), the Outliner plugin can help you navigate them more efficiently. It’s particularly useful if you’re working with nested lists or tasks.

### 5. **Quick Switcher++**:
   - This plugin enhances Obsidian's native search and navigation functionality, allowing you to quickly jump between notes or locate notes based on specific phrases or metadata.

### 6. **Obsidian Search Functionality**:
   - If you don’t want to install additional plugins, Obsidian’s built-in search function is very powerful. You can filter your search results by path, file name, content, and even tags, then batch edit or categorize the notes accordingly.

### 7. **Bulk Markdown Editor**:
   - If you want to make edits to multiple files simultaneously, you can use a third-party tool like **VS Code** with the **Obsidian Vault** opened. You can perform batch updates by leveraging VS Code's multi-file search and replace feature.

These tools can greatly improve your efficiency in reviewing and marking up the 1,500 notes.
