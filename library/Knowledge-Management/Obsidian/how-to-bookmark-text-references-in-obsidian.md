# Prompt

I have saved a large collection of notes in my Obsidian vault. I'd like to find a way to go through the backlog of interesting generations. Within specific notes, there are commonly just a few things that I want to highlight or flag for later review. Can you think of any tools that are designed to do this? I can bookmark notes. but it would be more useful to bookmark specific text within notes

# Output

To highlight and flag specific text within your Obsidian notes for later review, there are a few useful tools and methods you can employ:

## Highlightr Plugin

The Highlightr plugin is an excellent option for color-coding and highlighting specific text within your notes[2][3].

**Key features:**
- Adds a highlighting menu to Obsidian
- Allows you to choose from various highlight colors
- Customizable highlight colors
- Can be activated via hotkeys or context menu

To use Highlightr:
1. Install the plugin from the Obsidian community plugin store
2. Select the text you want to highlight
3. Use the assigned hotkey or right-click to open the highlighting menu
4. Choose your desired highlight color

## Native Highlighting

Obsidian also offers a built-in highlighting feature[1]:

- Use `==text==` to highlight text in yellow
- You can assign a hotkey for quick highlighting (e.g., Ctrl+Shift+H)

## Bookmarking Specific Sections

While you mentioned bookmarking entire notes, Obsidian's new Bookmarks core plugin actually allows you to bookmark specific sections within notes[5]:

- You can bookmark files, folders, searches, headings, and blocks
- Organize bookmarks in a dedicated Bookmark view
- Reorder bookmarks with drag-and-drop
- Create Bookmark Groups for better organization

## Additional Tips

1. **Comments**: You can use comments to annotate highlighted text[7]:
   ```markdown
   ==Highlighted text==%%Comment on the highlighted text%%
   ```

2. **Callouts**: Use callouts to emphasize and annotate important sections[7].

3. **Extract Highlights**: The "Extract Highlights" plugin can help you gather all your highlights in one place, though it has some limitations[7].

4. **Enhanced Annotations**: There's a community plugin called "Enhanced Annotations" that might provide additional functionality for annotating your notes[7].

By combining these methods, you can create a robust system for highlighting, flagging, and reviewing specific content within your Obsidian notes. The Highlightr plugin, in particular, offers a flexible and visually appealing way to mark important text for later review.
