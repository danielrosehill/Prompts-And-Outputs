In Obsidian, you can achieve a focused view on notes from a specific folder by using a combination of **pinned file explorers**, **search filters**, and **plugins**. Here are a few methods to help you focus one part of the screen on managing only notes from a specific folder:

### Method 1: **Use the File Explorer with Folder Focus**
You can use the built-in **File Explorer** and manually navigate to the specific folder, then pin the panel to keep it focused on that folder.

#### Steps:
1. **Open the File Explorer**: From the left sidebar, click on the **File Explorer** icon.
2. **Navigate to the Folder**: Find the folder you want to focus on and expand it.
3. **Pin the File Explorer**:
   - Right-click the top of the **File Explorer** pane and select **Pin**. This will keep the file explorer open and focused on the folder you've selected.
   - You can open a second instance of the File Explorer to navigate the rest of your vault while keeping the first pinned to the folder you're focused on.

### Method 2: **Using the Search Pane with Folder Filtering**
You can filter the search results to display only notes from a specific folder and pin the results pane for easy navigation.

#### Steps:
1. **Open the Search Pane**: Click the search icon in the left sidebar or use the shortcut `Ctrl + Shift + F`.
2. **Search Within the Folder**:
   - Type `path:"FolderName/"` in the search bar (replace "FolderName" with the name of your target folder).
   - This will filter the search results to only show notes within that specific folder.
3. **Pin the Search Pane**: 
   - Click the **pin** icon at the top of the search results pane. This will keep the results pane open and fixed on that folder’s contents.
4. **Focus on Notes**: Now you can easily click and manage any note from that specific folder directly from the search results.

### Method 3: **Use the Quick Switcher to Filter by Folder**
The **Quick Switcher** plugin allows you to quickly access and navigate notes. You can filter it by folder for faster access.

#### Steps:
1. **Open the Quick Switcher**: Use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl + O` (or `Cmd + O` on macOS) to open the Quick Switcher.
2. **Filter by Folder**:
   - Start typing the path to your folder, like `folder/`, and the Quick Switcher will limit its results to notes within that folder.
   - You can keep this switcher open temporarily to quickly jump between notes within the folder.

### Method 4: **Install the Workspace Plugin**
The **Workspace Plugin** allows you to save different panel configurations. You can use this to create a workspace with one panel focused on a folder.

#### Steps:
1. **Install the Workspace Plugin**:
   - Go to **Settings** > **Community Plugins** > Browse and search for **Workspaces**.
   - Install and enable the plugin.
2. **Set Up a Folder View**:
   - Open the file explorer and navigate to your desired folder.
   - Save this configuration as a **workspace** using the Workspace plugin so you can quickly return to this layout later.

### Method 5: **Use Folder Notes Plugin (Optional)**
The **Folder Notes Plugin** allows you to treat a folder like a note itself, which may help you organize and focus on managing notes within a specific folder.

#### Steps:
1. **Install Folder Notes Plugin**:
   - Go to **Settings** > **Community Plugins** > Browse and search for **Folder Notes**.
   - Install and enable it.
2. **Use the Folder Note as an Overview**:
   - Create a "folder note" that acts as a summary or manager of the notes within a specific folder.
   - You can keep this note open while accessing the files in the folder through it.

### Conclusion
To focus on managing only notes from a specific folder, you can:
- **Pin a File Explorer** focused on the desired folder.
- **Use Search Filters** (`path:"FolderName/"`) to display only notes from a folder.
- **Use the Quick Switcher** with folder filtering.
- **Use Workspaces** to save and reuse layouts focused on specific folders.
