# Prompt
A problem that I have with the way Obsidian handles tagging is that every time there is a hashtag in a document it automatically generates a tag. This means that I have many tags that I neither want nor need. Is there any way to remove these tags without deleting the data in the source documents?

# Output
To address the issue of unwanted tags being generated in Obsidian due to hashtags in your documents, you have a few options:

### **1. Use a Different Delimiter for Tags:**
   - **Obsidian does not natively support changing the tag delimiter** (e.g., using something other than `#`), but you can avoid using hashtags in contexts where you don't want them to be interpreted as tags. Instead, use another character or combination (e.g., `!tagname` or `~tagname`) that isn’t recognized as a tag by Obsidian.

### **2. Remove Unwanted Tags Programmatically:**
   - If you’ve already accumulated unwanted tags, you can use a script to remove these hashtags from your documents while leaving the data intact.
   - **Example Bash Script**:
     ```bash
     #!/bin/bash

     # Define the directory where your markdown files are stored
     DIRECTORY="path/to/your/obsidian/vault"

     # Replace unwanted hashtags with plain text
     for file in "$DIRECTORY"/*.md; do
         sed -i 's/#unwantedtag/unwantedtag/g' "$file"
     done
     ```
     - **Explanation**: This script replaces `#unwantedtag` with `unwantedtag` in all markdown files in the specified directory. You can customize it to remove or modify any hashtag that is causing unwanted tags.

### **3. Use Obsidian Plugins to Manage Tags:**
   - **Tag Wrangler Plugin**: This plugin allows you to manage and clean up tags more effectively within Obsidian.
     - **How to Use**:
       1. Install the Tag Wrangler plugin from the Obsidian community plugins.
       2. Use it to merge or delete unwanted tags without affecting the content in your notes.

### **4. Manual Cleanup via Obsidian's Tag Pane:**
   - Go to the Tag pane in Obsidian, where you can see all tags.
   - Manually click on unwanted tags to locate where they are used, and either edit the documents directly to remove or rename those tags.

### **5. Use Regex Search and Replace in Obsidian:**
   - Obsidian’s built-in search supports regex, which can be used to find and replace specific patterns across all files.
   - **How to Use**:
     - Open the search bar (`Ctrl+Shift+F`).
     - Use a regex search pattern like `#unwantedtag\b` to find all instances of an unwanted tag.
     - Replace it with the desired text or remove the hashtag.

This way, you can clean up your tags without losing any important data from your documents.## Extracted Prompts
