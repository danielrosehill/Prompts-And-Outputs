*Note: this repository consists of the outputs of large language models (LLMs). In many cases, these are unedited or minimally edited. The information provided is for demonstrative purposes only and is intended to highlight constraints and capabilities in LLM applications and prompt engineering strategies.*


# Prompt

I'd like to craft some technical documentation that I would like to share on Github describing how I'm structuring an Obsidian vault for LLM related work. Can you suggest some ways for me to describe the file tree structure in a way that I can frequently edit as it evolves? I would like to describe the purpose of every folder in the tree

# Output

To create easily editable and maintainable documentation for your Obsidian vault structure on GitHub, I recommend using a text-based representation of the file tree combined with explanations for each folder. Here's a suggested approach:

1. Use a markdown file to represent your file structure.

2. Utilize code blocks with indentation to show the hierarchy.

3. Add explanations for each folder directly after its entry in the tree.

Here's an example of how you could structure your documentation:

```markdown
# Obsidian Vault Structure for LLM Work

```
LLM-Vault/
├── Agents/
│   ├── Agent1/
│   └── Agent2/
├── Prompts/
│   ├── General/
│   └── Specific/
├── Outputs/
│   ├── Raw/
│   └── Processed/
└── Resources/
    ├── Papers/
    └── Tutorials/
```

## Folder Descriptions

### Agents
This folder contains configurations and settings for different LLM agents.
- **Agent1**: [Description of Agent1's purpose and configuration]
- **Agent2**: [Description of Agent2's purpose and configuration]

### Prompts
Stores various prompts used in LLM interactions.
- **General**: Common, multi-purpose prompts
- **Specific**: Prompts tailored for particular tasks or domains

### Outputs
Contains the results and outputs from LLM interactions.
- **Raw**: Unprocessed outputs directly from the LLM
- **Processed**: Refined or analyzed versions of the raw outputs

### Resources
Supplementary materials and references for LLM work.
- **Papers**: Academic papers and research articles related to LLMs
- **Tutorials**: Guides and tutorials for working with LLMs and related tools
```

This approach offers several advantages:

1. It's easy to edit and maintain as your structure evolves.
2. The code block provides a clear visual representation of the folder hierarchy.
3. Explanations for each folder are directly tied to their position in the tree.
4. It's fully text-based, making it easy to track changes in version control.
5. The markdown format renders nicely on GitHub, making it easy to read online.

As your vault structure evolves, you can simply update the tree structure in the code block and add or modify the explanations accordingly. This method allows for frequent updates and provides a clear, comprehensive overview of your Obsidian vault structure for LLM-related work.
