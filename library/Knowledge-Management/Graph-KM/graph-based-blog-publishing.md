Yes, there are a few blogging platforms and tools that are beginning to explore the concept of displaying content as interconnected graphs rather than traditional linear formats. While this concept is still relatively niche, here are some notable examples:

### **1. Obsidian Publish**
   - **Description:** Obsidian is a note-taking app that allows users to create a network of interlinked Markdown files. With **Obsidian Publish**, you can take your private vault and make it publicly accessible, complete with its graph view.
   - **Graph Display:** Obsidian’s graph view is an interactive, visual map that shows how notes (blog posts) are interconnected. Users can explore the graph by clicking on nodes, which then open the relevant note.
   - **Best For:** Users who want to showcase a network of interrelated content, like a digital garden or interconnected blog. It’s also perfect if you're already using Obsidian for personal note-taking and want to take your notes public.
   - **Example:** [Andy Matuschak’s Notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/) — Andy's digital notes use a graph-like structure, though not directly using Obsidian Publish, it has a similar feel.

### **2. Roam Research**
   - **Description:** Roam is known for its bi-directional linking, which allows users to see how notes (or blog entries) are interconnected. While not a traditional blog, it has a feature to make your Roam graph public, letting readers explore your ideas through a web of interconnected notes.
   - **Graph Display:** Roam automatically creates a network graph showing connections between ideas, notes, and references. Users can explore topics non-linearly by clicking through the graph.
   - **Best For:** Bloggers who want to present their content in a networked thought format, ideal for knowledge exploration and mapping complex topics.
   - **Example:** [Roam Public Graphs](https://roamresearch.com/#/public) — Some users make their graphs public for others to explore.

### **3. TiddlyWiki with TiddlyMap**
   - **Description:** **TiddlyWiki** is a non-linear notebook that allows for highly customizable note-taking and content publishing. **TiddlyMap** is a plugin that visualizes the connections between different “tiddlers” (individual notes or posts) in a graph format.
   - **Graph Display:** TiddlyMap creates a visual graph where users can see how different notes are linked. This makes it easy to navigate through related content based on connections rather than a traditional blog layout.
   - **Best For:** Users who want a self-hosted, highly customizable solution. Ideal for those comfortable with tinkering and who want complete control over their content and how it’s presented.
   - **Example:** [Dynalist TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com/) — Check out the TiddlyMap plugin for graph visualization.

### **4. TheBrain**
   - **Description:** **TheBrain** is a tool for personal knowledge management that organizes information in a visual, interconnected web. You can create “thoughts” (nodes) and link them together, displaying the relationships dynamically.
   - **Graph Display:** It displays a central “thought” with related thoughts branching out around it, making it possible to navigate complex webs of information. Users can share public links to their brains, allowing visitors to explore the graph interactively.
   - **Best For:** Visual thinkers who want to represent their ideas in a dynamic, non-linear format. It’s also great for mapping relationships between concepts, topics, or blog posts.
   - **Example:** [Public Brain Examples](https://www.thebrain.com/solutions/public) — Examples of publicly shared brains.

### **5. Logseq**
   - **Description:** **Logseq** is an open-source note-taking and personal knowledge management tool that’s similar to Roam. It’s Markdown-based, with an emphasis on privacy and local-first data. Logseq also provides a graph view of interconnected notes.
   - **Graph Display:** It features a graph view that allows users to see how notes and content are interconnected. You can navigate through the graph by clicking on nodes, which makes it easy to explore related topics.
   - **Best For:** Users who prefer privacy and local-first tools, or those looking for an open-source alternative to Roam. It can be used for digital gardens or blogs that emphasize interconnected thoughts.
   - **Example:** [Logseq Official](https://logseq.com/) — While not a traditional blog, it can be set up to publish interconnected notes.

### **6. Athens Research**
   - **Description:** Inspired by Roam Research, **Athens** is an open-source knowledge management tool that emphasizes bi-directional linking and graph-based navigation. You can create public pages that showcase interconnected ideas.
   - **Graph Display:** Similar to Roam, it creates a graph of interconnected content, allowing users to explore links between notes.
   - **Best For:** Users looking for an open-source, privacy-focused tool with similar functionality to Roam but at no cost. Good for non-linear content exploration.
   - **Example:** [Athens Research](https://athensresearch.org/)

### **7. Digital Gardens (Concept)**
   - **Description:** The concept of **digital gardens** has become popular in recent years. Unlike traditional blogs, digital gardens are non-linear collections of notes, thoughts, and essays that grow over time. They often make use of graph-based navigation to show connections between ideas.
   - **Graph Display:** Digital gardens frequently feature graph visualizations (using Obsidian, Roam, TiddlyWiki, or custom setups) where content is not necessarily arranged chronologically but by interconnected topics, themes, or ideas.
   - **Best For:** Writers and thinkers who want to share a continuously evolving set of ideas. It’s great for exploration, discovery, and showing the relationships between concepts.
   - **Example:** [Maggie Appleton's Digital Garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden) — An excellent example of a digital garden, using a graph-like structure to interlink notes.

### **Summary & Recommendations**
- **If you want a ready-to-go graph-based blog experience:** Consider **Obsidian Publish** or **Logseq**, as both allow for easy publishing with graph navigation out-of-the-box.
- **For more customization and control:** Use **TiddlyWiki with TiddlyMap** or **TheBrain**, which can be tailored to your needs but require a bit more effort to set up.
- **If you prefer open-source options:** Explore **Athens Research** or **Logseq**.
- **To embrace the concept of digital gardens:** Look into building your site as a digital garden, possibly using a tool like **Gatsby** with a graph component or a custom setup that allows you to integrate graph visualizations.

These platforms and concepts are at the forefront of a more networked, interlinked way of sharing content, ideal for those who want to move away from traditional blog formats. Let me know if you’d like more details on any of these!
