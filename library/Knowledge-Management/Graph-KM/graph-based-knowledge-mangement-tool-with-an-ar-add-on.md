Knowledge Management System Specification

# Introduction

This document outlines the specification for a comprehensive knowledge management (KM) system that captures, organizes, and visualizes information for enhanced thought exploration. Key features include markdown-based input, semantic linking, search capabilities, and an innovative augmented reality (AR) interface that visualizes information as a cosmic space environment. Users can explore interconnected knowledge nodes like navigating stars, creating an immersive experience for data discovery.

# Core System Features

## 1. Frontend for Markdown Capture and Live Preview

The frontend allows users to capture LLM outputs in markdown format with live preview. Key fields include Title, Prompt, and Output. The user interface provides a markdown editor and a live preview pane, enabling users to see rendered markdown immediately. For now, the tool supports copy-pasting outputs, with future plans to integrate direct LLM processing capabilities.

Technologies: React with React Markdown, Quill.js or Editor.js

## 2. Graph Database for Storing Prompts and Outputs (Neo4j)

The backend utilizes Neo4j as the primary database for storing knowledge nodes and relationships. Each prompt and output is saved as separate nodes in Neo4j, allowing flexible and dynamic data organization.

Features:

- Nodes represent individual prompts and outputs

- Relationships indicate links between related topics or tags

- Nodes and relationships store metadata (tags, date, theme)

Technologies: Neo4j with Neo4j Python or JavaScript Driver

## 3. Intelligent Networked Thought Discovery

The system uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to identify relationships between stored prompts and outputs, creating connections between similar concepts. This component provides 'thought trails' that guide users through related nodes, simulating the experience of following a train of thought.

Technologies: spaCy or Hugging Face Transformers, Neo4j Graph Data Science (GDS) Library

## 4. Search Interface for Knowledge Retrieval

A flexible search interface enables users to search the stored data by keywords or semantically. Search filters include options for tags, date, and theme to refine results.

Technologies: Elasticsearch for keyword search, OpenAI Embeddings or Sentence Transformers for semantic search

# Augmented Reality (AR) for Interactive Knowledge Exploration

## 1. AR Space Exploration UI

The AR interface enables users to navigate a cosmic visualization of their knowledge database. Each node is represented as a star or planet, and connections between nodes are depicted as ropes or light beams, allowing users to explore thought connections in a space-like environment.

Technologies: Unity with AR Foundation, ARKit (iOS) or ARCore (Android)

## 2. Gesture Control and Interaction

Gesture recognition allows users to 'swim' through space, select nodes, and pull on connections. Gestures enable users to access node details, with controls for expanding or reading related thoughts by interacting with connected 'ropes'.

Technologies: Leap Motion Controller for hand tracking, or Mediapipe for mobile gesture recognition

## 3. Data Integration with Neo4j

The AR system accesses and updates data directly from Neo4j. Real-time data retrieval provides dynamic exploration, allowing users to interact directly with knowledge nodes and connections.

Technologies: GraphQL or REST API for Neo4j integration with Unity

## 4. Semantic Search and Contextual Voice Commands

In the AR environment, users can perform searches via voice commands, triggering semantic searches to locate relevant nodes. This feature leverages embeddings to connect contextually similar thoughts and display related information dynamically in AR.

Technologies: OpenAI Embeddings API, Unity for voice and semantic search

# Conclusion

This knowledge management system integrates Markdown-based input, intelligent linking, and an innovative AR interface to create an immersive, interactive knowledge discovery experience. The backend utilizes Neo4j to manage data and relationships, while the frontend and AR components provide a user-friendly interface for capturing, exploring, and retrieving information. Future developments could include deeper LLM integration, enhanced AR gestures, and expanded search capabilities.
