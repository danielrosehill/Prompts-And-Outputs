# Prompt
Could you give me a list of the various knowledge management systems which have native support for graph databases and which are really based around this idea?

# Output
Certainly! Here’s a list of knowledge management systems and tools that have native support for graph databases or are fundamentally based on the concept of graph-based data organization:

### **1. **Neo4j**
   - **Description**: Neo4j is a highly popular, native graph database platform designed specifically for managing and querying graph data. It’s used for knowledge management in complex domains where relationships between data points are as important as the data itself.
   - **Use Cases**: Knowledge graphs, social networks, recommendation systems, fraud detection, and more.
   - **Key Features**: Cypher query language, ACID compliance, scalability, and integration with various programming languages.
   - **Website**: [neo4j.com](https://neo4j.com/)

### **2. **Obsidian**
   - **Description**: Obsidian is a markdown-based knowledge management system that features a powerful graph view to visualize the relationships between your notes. While it doesn't use a true graph database, its graph view allows for a graph-centric approach to personal knowledge management.
   - **Use Cases**: Personal knowledge management, Zettelkasten, note-taking, and research.
   - **Key Features**: Graph view, backlinks, plugins, and markdown support.
   - **Website**: [obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/)

### **3. **Roam Research**
   - **Description**: Roam Research is a note-taking tool designed around the concept of bi-directional linking and graph-based relationships. It allows users to create a web of connected ideas, making it easier to explore and discover connections within your notes.
