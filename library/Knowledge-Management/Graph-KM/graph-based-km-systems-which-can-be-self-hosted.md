# Prompt

Are there any graph based knowledge management tools that can be self-hosted (on a web server) At a minimum, I'd need a tool capable of storing new knowledge snippets and of retrieving previously stored ones via a search functionality

# Output

Here are some graph-based, self-hostable knowledge management tools that support storing and retrieving knowledge snippets with search functionality:

### 1. **Athens Research**
   - **Description**: Athens Research is an open-source, self-hostable tool inspired by Roam Research. It uses a graph database to connect notes with bidirectional links, forming a networked knowledge base.
   - **Features**:
     - **Graph view** for visualizing relationships between notes.
     - **Bidirectional linking** for easy association of ideas.
     - **Search functionality** for retrieving specific notes and topics.
   - **Self-Hosting**: You can deploy it on your own web server or run it locally. It’s compatible with Docker, which makes deployment straightforward.
   - **Ideal Use**: Great for users who want Roam-like networked notes with a focus on linking and graph visualization in a self-hosted environment.

### 2. **Logseq (Self-Hosted via Local Network or Web Server)**
   - **Description**: Logseq is an open-source, Markdown-based knowledge management tool that supports bidirectional links and visual graph views.
   - **Features**:
     - **Graph visualization** for mapping knowledge connections.
     - **Search and filtering** functionality for locating notes.
     - **Markdown and Org-mode support** for flexible note formatting.
   - **Self-Hosting**: Although primarily local-first, Logseq can be set up on a web server with the help of Docker or Git-based syncing. It allows local network access for self-hosting on a web server.
   - **Ideal Use**: Logseq is well-suited for users who want a local-first setup with self-hosted accessibility and a graph view for interconnected notes.

### 3. **TiddlyWiki with TiddlyMap Plugin**
   - **Description**: TiddlyWiki is an open-source personal wiki that, combined with TiddlyMap, offers graph visualization for a networked note structure.
   - **Features**:
     - **Visual mapping** with TiddlyMap, allowing for graph-style connections.
     - **Tagging and advanced search** options to retrieve notes easily.
     - **Highly customizable** for creating a tailored wiki experience.
   - **Self-Hosting**: Easily self-hostable by deploying to a web server (Apache, Nginx) or using services like Dropbox and Nextcloud. TiddlyWiki can also be run as a single HTML file with server-side storage if needed.
   - **Ideal Use**: TiddlyWiki with TiddlyMap is perfect for those looking for a wiki-like knowledge base with graph capabilities and extensive customization.

### 4. **Trilium Notes**
   - **Description**: Trilium Notes is an open-source note-taking application that supports hierarchical and graph-based relationships between notes. It allows for rich note relationships and graph visualization, suitable for knowledge management.
   - **Features**:
     - **Bidirectional linking and graph view** for note connections.
     - **Full-text search** for retrieving stored snippets.
     - **Tagging and hierarchical structure** for additional organization.
   - **Self-Hosting**: Trilium can be easily hosted on a web server with Docker. It has a web-based interface for easy access across devices.
   - **Ideal Use**: Ideal for users needing a blend of structured hierarchy and flexible connections with a robust self-hosting option.

### 5. **Dendron (Web Server Hosting with Git Integration)**
   - **Description**: Dendron is a knowledge management system designed to work with Markdown and can be configured to show graph visualizations of linked notes.
   - **Features**:
     - **Graph view** with hierarchical and networked relationships.
     - **Powerful search** that allows for extensive note retrieval.
     - **Backlinking and tagging** for managing connections and themes.
   - **Self-Hosting**: While Dendron is designed to work locally, it can be hosted via GitHub Pages or a static site generator setup, making it accessible over the web.
   - **Ideal Use**: Dendron works well for users wanting a Markdown-based, search-friendly setup with graph capabilities, though self-hosting may require some configuration.

Each of these tools supports graph-based knowledge management with search and linking capabilities, allowing you to self-host and customize your knowledge repository. The choice depends on the level of customization you need, the technical configuration you’re comfortable with, and the specific visualization and search functionality that best suits your workflow.
