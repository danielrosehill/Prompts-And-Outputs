# Prompt

I'd be interested in using Logseq as an alternative to Obsidian for storing my prompt vault. Or any other markdown based note taker really. However, I'd like to continue with my approach of using B2 as my storage so that I can be assured that i have access to the outputs as they are stored. I know that Logseq is local first, but does its support saving outputs in a cloud you manage? Does it have a mobile app? Any other suitable programs for my requirements and preferences?

# Output
### Logseq Overview
Logseq is a markdown-based, local-first note-taking application that emphasizes privacy and data ownership. It indeed has several features that align with your requirements:

- **Local-First with Cloud Sync Options:** While Logseq is local-first, you can set up synchronization with a cloud service of your choice, including Backblaze B2, by using third-party sync tools or mounting B2 as a local drive using software like Rclone. This setup would allow you to store and manage your notes in a cloud you control.

- **Mobile App:** Logseq offers a mobile app for both iOS and Android, making it possible to access and edit your notes on the go.

- **Markdown Support:** Logseq natively uses markdown for its notes, so it’s fully compatible with your existing markdown-based workflows.

### Alternatives to Logseq

1. **Joplin**
   - **Local-First with Cloud Sync:** Joplin is another markdown-based note-taking app that is local-first. It has built-in support for syncing with a variety of cloud services, including WebDAV, OneDrive, and Dropbox. While it doesn’t natively support Backblaze B2, you could use Rclone or other similar tools to sync your notes with B2.
   - **Mobile App:** Joplin has mobile apps for both iOS and Android.
   - **Open-Source:** Joplin is open-source, offering flexibility in customization and ensuring that your data remains under your control.

2. **Standard Notes**
   - **Security Focus:** Standard Notes is a markdown-based, encrypted note-taking app that prioritizes privacy and security.
   - **Cloud Sync:** It uses end-to-end encryption and syncs with its own cloud service. However, it also allows you to self-host the server or use a different cloud provider through extensions.
   - **Mobile App:** Standard Notes has mobile apps for both iOS and Android.

3. **Notable**
   - **Markdown-Based:** Notable is a markdown-based note-taking app designed to be simple yet powerful.
   - **Cloud Sync:** You can use any cloud service that supports file syncing (e.g., Backblaze B2 via Rclone) since Notable uses a local folder for storing notes.
   - **No Mobile App:** Notable does not currently have a mobile app, which might be a drawback for your use case.

4. **Zettlr**
   - **Academic and Markdown-Focused:** Zettlr is a markdown-based editor designed for academic writing but also works well for general note-taking.
   - **Cloud Sync:** You can store your Zettlr notes in any cloud service by syncing the local folder with a cloud provider like Backblaze B2 using tools like Rclone.
   - **No Official Mobile App:** Zettlr does not have an official mobile app, but your notes can be accessed on mobile through synced cloud storage.

### Conclusion
Logseq, Joplin, and Standard Notes seem to be the best options based on your requirements. They all support markdown, have mobile apps, and can be configured to store data in a cloud service that you manage, such as Backblaze B2. Logseq’s local-first approach with the possibility of cloud sync through tools like Rclone makes it a strong candidate, especially if you value having control over your storage solution.
