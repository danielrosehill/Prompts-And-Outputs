# Prompt

Can we go back to the Github backup script we worked on earlier. To reset context, the purpose of this script is to recurse through the repositories I have in /home/daniel/Git
I want the script to create something like an "imprint" of all the remote repos and all their local paths 
The idea would be that this file could be used in order to replicate the structure on a new machine. 
The script will be run repeatedly, perhaps nightly. It is likely that I will move the repositories around sometimes. It could use an incremental approach so long as this would not pose a problem and it could update the moves
The script will run in /Script relative to the repo root
It should produce its outputs in /Backups relative to the repo root
Whatever format the backup is produce in, it should be prepended by ddmmyy_hhmm reflecting the time of run

# Output

Here's an updated version of the script that will create an "imprint" of all your local Git repositories and their remote URLs, and store the output in the desired format in the `/Backups` directory. The script will be run from `/Script` relative to the repo root and will store the output in `/Backups`, with filenames that include a timestamp.

### **Script Overview**:
1. **Recurse through `/home/daniel/Git`** to find all `.git` directories.
2. For each repository, retrieve its **remote URL** and record the **local path**.
3. Store this data in a **backup file** within the `/Backups` directory.
4. The filename will be prepended with a timestamp in the format `ddmmyy_hhmm`.
5. The script will be **incremental**, meaning it can be run repeatedly and will update the file if a repository is moved or its structure is changed.

### **Script**:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Base directories for repos and backups
GIT_DIR="/home/daniel/Git"  # Root directory where all your git repos are located
SCRIPT_DIR="$(dirname "$0")"  # The /Script directory (relative to where this script is run)
BACKUP_DIR="$SCRIPT_DIR/../Backups"  # Directory where backups will be saved

# Create backup directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p "$BACKUP_DIR"

# Get the current timestamp for file naming (format: ddmmyy_hhmm)
TIMESTAMP=$(date +"%d%m%y_%H%M")

# Define the backup file name
BACKUP_FILE="$BACKUP_DIR/${TIMESTAMP}_git_repos_backup.txt"

# Initialize the backup file
echo "[INFO] Creating backup file: $BACKUP_FILE"
echo "Backup of local Git repositories with their remote URLs." > "$BACKUP_FILE"
echo "Generated on $(date)" >> "$BACKUP_FILE"
echo "" >> "$BACKUP_FILE"

# Function to find all local git repositories and save their paths and remotes
function backup_repos() {
    echo "[INFO] Starting to scan directories for Git repositories..."

    local repo_count=0

    # Find all directories containing a .git folder
    find "$GIT_DIR" -type d -name ".git" | while read -r git_dir; do
        # Get the repository's root directory
        repo_dir=$(dirname "$git_dir")
        
        # Try to get the remote URL for the repository
        repo_url=$(git -C "$repo_dir" remote get-url origin 2>/dev/null)

        # If a remote URL exists, save it to the backup file
        if [ -n "$repo_url" ]; then
            echo "[INFO] Backing up repository: $repo_dir"
            echo "Repo Path: $repo_dir" >> "$BACKUP_FILE"
            echo "Remote URL: $repo_url" >> "$BACKUP_FILE"
            echo "" >> "$BACKUP_FILE"
            ((repo_count++))
        else
            echo "[WARNING] No remote URL found for repo at $repo_dir"
        fi
    done

    echo "[INFO] Finished backing up $repo_count repositories."
}

# Run the backup process
backup_repos

# Output success message
echo "[INFO] Backup complete. Output saved to $BACKUP_FILE."
```

### **How the Script Works**:
1. **Recurse Through Repositories**: 
   - The script will search recursively through `/home/daniel/Git` to find all `.git` directories.
   - For each `.git` directory found, it will retrieve the repositoryâ€™s root directory and attempt to get the remote URL.

2. **Create the Backup File**:
   - The backup file will be saved in `/Backups` relative to the script root (`/Script`).
   - The filename will be prepended with a timestamp in the format `ddmmyy_hhmm` to reflect the time of the run.

3. **Incremental and Repeated Runs**:
   - Since the script retrieves the current state of the repositories (path and remote URL), any changes (e.g., if you move a repo or update its remote URL) will be reflected in the next run. The previous backups will be kept as they are timestamped, so no information will be lost.

4. **Logging**:
   - Each step is logged with `[INFO]` for regular operations and `[WARNING]` if a repository does not have a remote URL set up.

### **Running the Script**:
1. **Ensure the Script is Executable**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x /path/to/Script/git_backup.sh
   ```

2. **Run the Script**:
   Execute the script from within the `/Script` directory:
   ```bash
   ./git_backup.sh
   ```

3. **Output**:
   The backup file will be created in the `/Backups` directory, and the file will look something like this:
   
   ```
   Backup of local Git repositories with their remote URLs.
   Generated on Sat Oct 12 10:00:00 UTC 2024

   Repo Path: /home/daniel/Git/project1
   Remote URL: git@github.com:danielrosehill/project1.git

   Repo Path: /home/daniel/Git/project2
   Remote URL: git@github.com:danielrosehill/project2.git
   ```

### **Features**:
- **Automatic Timestamp**: Each backup file is automatically named with the current date and time.
- **Incremental Backup**: The script captures the current state of repositories and paths each time it is run.
- **Log Warnings**: If a repository does not have a remote URL, it logs a warning.
- **Human-readable Output**: The backup file is in plain text, easy to read and interpret, and can be used later to recreate the structure on a new machine.

### **Restoring on a New Machine**:
Once you have the backup file, you can write a **restore script** that reads this file and clones the repositories into the correct paths on the new machine. The restore script could read the file, create the necessary directories, and use `git clone` to restore the repositories.

Let me know if you need a restore script or any further customizations!

# Example restore script

Here is the **restore script** that reads the backup file and clones the repositories into the appropriate directories on a new machine. This script will:

1. Read the **backup file** created by the previous backup script.
2. Create any necessary directories for each repository.
3. Clone the repositories into the appropriate local paths based on the recorded structure in the backup file.

### **Restore Script**:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Base directory where the Git repositories should be restored
GIT_DIR="/home/daniel/Git"

# Backup file to read (modify this to match your backup file)
BACKUP_FILE="/path/to/Backups/ddmmyy_hhmm_git_repos_backup.txt"  # Replace with actual path to the backup file

# Function to restore repositories
function restore_repos() {
    echo "[INFO] Starting repository restoration from backup file: $BACKUP_FILE"

    local repo_count=0

    # Read the backup file line by line
    while IFS= read -r line; do
        # Check if the line contains a repo path
        if [[ "$line" == Repo\ Path:* ]]; then
            # Extract the local repo path
            repo_path=$(echo "$line" | cut -d' ' -f3-)
            full_repo_path="$GIT_DIR/$repo_path"
            
            # Read the next line for the remote URL
            read -r next_line
            if [[ "$next_line" == Remote\ URL:* ]]; then
                # Extract the remote URL
                repo_url=$(echo "$next_line" | cut -d' ' -f3-)

                # Create the directory structure if it doesn't exist
                mkdir -p "$full_repo_path"
                echo "[INFO] Cloning repository: $repo_url into $full_repo_path"

                # Clone the repository into the correct directory
                if git clone "$repo_url" "$full_repo_path"; then
                    echo "[INFO] Successfully cloned $repo_url to $full_repo_path"
                    ((repo_count++))
                else
                    echo "[ERROR] Failed to clone $repo_url"
                fi
            fi
        fi
    done < "$BACKUP_FILE"

    echo "[INFO] Finished restoring $repo_count repositories."
}

# Run the restore process
restore_repos
```

### **How the Restore Script Works**:
1. **Read the Backup File**:
   - The script reads the backup file created by the backup script, line by line.
   - It looks for lines that start with `Repo Path:` and `Remote URL:`, extracting the path and URL of each repository.
   
2. **Create the Directory Structure**:
   - For each repository, the script creates the necessary directory structure under the `/home/daniel/Git` folder (or whatever directory is specified by `GIT_DIR`).

3. **Clone the Repositories**:
   - The script then clones each repository from its remote URL into the correct local directory.
   - If a repository fails to clone, it logs an error.

### **Running the Script**:
1. **Ensure the Script is Executable**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x /path/to/restore_script.sh
   ```

2. **Set the Backup File Path**:
   - Make sure to set the correct path to the backup file in the `BACKUP_FILE` variable in the script:
   ```bash
   BACKUP_FILE="/path/to/Backups/ddmmyy_hhmm_git_repos_backup.txt"  # Set to the actual backup file path
   ```

3. **Run the Restore Script**:
   Run the script from your terminal:
   ```bash
   ./restore_script.sh
   ```

### **Output**:
The script will display logs for each repository it processes:
```bash
[INFO] Starting repository restoration from backup file: /path/to/Backups/ddmmyy_hhmm_git_repos_backup.txt
[INFO] Cloning repository: git@github.com:danielrosehill/project1.git into /home/daniel/Git/project1
[INFO] Successfully cloned git@github.com:danielrosehill/project1.git to /home/daniel/Git/project1
[INFO] Cloning repository: git@github.com:danielrosehill/project2.git into /home/daniel/Git/project2
[INFO] Successfully cloned git@github.com:danielrosehill/project2.git to /home/daniel/Git/project2
[INFO] Finished restoring 2 repositories.
```

### **Customizing the Restore Script**:
1. **Backup File Path**: Ensure the `BACKUP_FILE` variable points to the correct backup file.
2. **Directory Structure**: The script assumes that the directory structure should be recreated under `/home/daniel/Git`. Modify the `GIT_DIR` variable if you need to restore the repositories to a different location.

### **Additional Features You Can Add**:
- **Selective Restore**: You can modify the script to restore only specific repositories based on user input or a partial match of repository names.
- **Parallel Cloning**: If you have many repositories, you can use a parallel cloning method (e.g., GNU Parallel or background jobs) to speed up the cloning process.

This restore script should now be ready to recreate the repository structure on a new machine using the backup file generated by the backup script. Let me know if you need any further modifications!
