     - Online-based service for 3D model creation, focusing on speed and simplicity.
   - **Website**: [Kaedim](https://www.kaedim3d.com/)

### 6. **Deep Dream Generator**
   - **Description**: Deep Dream Generator is another AI tool for transforming and generating new images based on a specific model or concept. It’s not as tailored to 3D models, but it allows you to use the uploaded photos of your stuffed animal to create artistic, AI-generated variations.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Uses AI to create dreamy, surreal versions of uploaded photos.
     - Fully online with a simple interface.
   - **Website**: [Deep Dream Generator](https://deepdreamgenerator.com/)

### 7. **Meshroom (via Online Services)**
   - **Description**: Meshroom is a photogrammetry tool that’s typically run locally, but some online services offer photogrammetry as a cloud service. You upload a series of photos, and the service generates a 3D model that can be used in AI image generation or rendering.
   - **Use Case**: Ideal if you want a highly accurate 3D model of your stuffed animal.
   - **Online Service Examples**: Some services like Sketchfab offer integration with Meshroom for uploading and sharing 3D models online.
   - **Website**: [Meshroom (AliceVision)](https://alicevision.org/#meshroom)

### Workflow Summary for Online Model Creation:
1. **Select a Platform**: Choose one of the platforms based on whether you need 3D models (like Luma AI or Kaedim) or AI-generated images (like Dreambooth or Artbreeder).
2. **Upload Your Photos**: Provide a series of photos of your stuffed animal, ensuring different angles and clear views.
3. **Train or Create the Model**: Use the online platform to train the AI model or generate a 3D model from the photos.
4. **Generate AI Images**: Once the model is ready, use the service to generate new images in various styles and settings, using your custom stuffed animal model.

These online tools allow you to go from a collection of photos to a versatile digital or AI model without the need for self-hosting or advanced technical skills.

# Clarifying what this is called

So this area is called photogrammetry? Are there any fully free/open source tools for this?

# Output

Yes, the process of creating 3D models from a series of photos is called **photogrammetry**. It is widely used to generate accurate models of real-world objects based on images taken from different angles. Several fully free and open-source tools are available for photogrammetry:

### 1. **Meshroom (by AliceVision)**
   - **Description**: Meshroom is one of the most popular free, open-source photogrammetry tools. It uses a series of images taken from different angles to automatically create a 3D model.
