# Prompt
Here's another idea that I have. So I'm building out this inventory of gpt outputs in an obsidian vault. It would be great if I could leverage another AI tool on top of the vault (or notepad app) which would give me a daily summary of the interactions that I've logged on the previous day. It might produce a succint report which provides highlights from some key interactions. Can you think of any way I might implement that?

# Output
Implementing a daily summary of interactions logged in your Obsidian vault (or your custom notepad app) that leverages another AI tool could be a powerful addition to your workflow. Here's a general approach you can take to achieve this:

### **1. Outline the Workflow**
   - **Input**: The system will scan the previous day’s entries in your Obsidian vault or markdown files.
   - **Processing**: The AI will analyze these interactions, extract key highlights, and generate a summary.
   - **Output**: A daily report, either saved back into the vault or sent to you via email or another notification method.

### **2. Choosing an AI Tool**
   - **OpenAI GPT or Similar Models**: You can use GPT-4 or other language models to process and summarize the content. This would involve feeding the tool the content from the previous day and asking it to generate a summary.
   - **LangChain or LlamaIndex**: These tools can help you structure and manage interactions with the language model, especially when working with larger documents or multiple files.

### **3. Implementation Steps**

#### **Step 1: Extract Data from the Vault**
   - **Script to Gather Entries**:
     - Write a script that automatically scans your vault for entries from the previous day.
     - The script could filter files based on the date, assuming each entry has a timestamp or date-based filename.

   ```python
   import os
   from datetime import datetime, timedelta

   # Define your vault path
   vault_path = '/path/to/obsidian/vault'
   yesterday = (datetime.now() - timedelta(1)).strftime('%Y-%m-%d')

   # Function to find files from the previous day
   def find_yesterday_files(vault_path, date_str):
       yesterday_files = []
       for root, dirs, files in os.walk(vault_path):
           for file in files:
               if file.endswith('.md') and date_str in file:
                   yesterday_files.append(os.path.join(root, file))
       return yesterday_files

   yesterday_files = find_yesterday_files(vault_path, yesterday)
   ```

   - **Extract Content**:
     - Once the files are identified, extract the content to feed it to the AI model.

#### **Step 2: Process the Data with AI**
   - **Using OpenAI GPT API**:
     - Use the extracted content as input to GPT-4, instructing it to generate a summary of key interactions.

   ```python
   import openai

   openai.api_key = 'your-api-key'

   def summarize_content(content):
       response = openai.Completion.create(
           engine="gpt-4",
           prompt=f"Summarize the following interactions from {yesterday}:\n{content}\nHighlight key points and provide a summary.",
           max_tokens=150,
           temperature=0.7,
       )
       return response.choices[0].text.strip()

   daily_summary = ""
   for file in yesterday_files:
       with open(file, 'r') as f:
           content = f.read()
           daily_summary += summarize_content(content) + "\n\n"

   # Optional: Save the summary back into the vault
   summary_filename = f"{yesterday}_daily_summary.md"
   summary_path = os.path.join(vault_path, "Summaries", summary_filename)
   os.makedirs(os.path.dirname(summary_path), exist_ok=True)
   with open(summary_path, 'w') as summary_file:
       summary_file.write(f"# Daily Summary for {yesterday}\n\n{daily_summary}")
   ```

   - **Integrate with LLM**: If you’re using a custom notepad app, integrate this functionality directly within your app, making it a daily automated task.

#### **Step 3: Automate the Process**
   - **Scheduled Task**:
     - Set up a cron job (Linux) or use Task Scheduler (Windows) to run the script daily, automatically generating and storing the summary.
   - **Notifications**:
     - Optionally, send the summary via email or a notification service to ensure you review it daily.

   ```bash
   0 6 * * * /usr/bin/python3 /path/to/your/script.py
   ```

#### **Step 4: Enhance the Summary**
   - **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**:
     - Use additional NLP techniques like keyword extraction or sentiment analysis to enhance the summary, making it more informative.
   - **Custom Prompts**:
     - Fine-tune the prompt given to GPT-4 based on your specific needs, like focusing on certain types of interactions or categorizing the summary by themes.

### **Final Considerations**
- **Data Privacy**: Ensure that sensitive data is handled appropriately, especially if using third-party AI services.
- **Storage**: Decide where to store the daily summaries (e.g., a dedicated folder in your vault) and how to organize them for easy retrieval.
- **Scalability**: As your vault grows, consider optimizing the script to handle larger datasets, possibly by processing entries incrementally or focusing only on the most relevant sections.

This approach gives you a powerful tool for extracting valuable insights from your daily interactions with LLMs, helping you stay organized and making the most of your stored outputs.## Extracted Prompts
