# Prompt

I love doing this kind of tech research but I'm not always ready to buy things. It would be great to be able to save these specs that I send into you so that I could run them at a later point in time, particularly as products always change. Can you think of any ways I clever ways we could use to save these specs? Take this spec ... how would you summarise my preferences?

# Output

Your idea to save and revisit tech specifications is excellent, especially given how quickly products change. Based on our conversation, here's a summary of your preferences:

## User Preference Summary

- **Device Type**: Full keyboard with integrated macro keys
- **Macro Keys**: At least 6 dedicated macro keys
- **Connectivity**: Preference for wireless (Bluetooth or 2.4GHz)
- **Lighting**: Strong preference against RGB lighting, or ability to disable it
- **Price Range**: Flexible, but value-conscious (options ranging from $70 to $250 considered)
- **Additional Features**: Customizable keys, durable build quality
- **Software**: Easy-to-use configuration software for macro programming

To save and revisit these specifications, here are some clever ways you could approach it:

1. **Structured Data Format**: 
   Create a JSON or YAML file with your preferences. For example:

   ```yaml
   keyboard_preferences:
     type: "full_with_macro"
     macro_keys: "6+"
     connectivity: ["wireless", "bluetooth", "2.4GHz"]
     lighting: "no_rgb_preferred"
     price_range: 
       min: 70
       max: 250
     features: 
       - "customizable_keys"
       - "durable_build"
     software: "easy_macro_programming"
   ```

2. **Version Control**:
   Use a Git repository to store these preference files. This allows you to track changes over time and maintain different versions for various product categories.

3. **Tagging System**:
   Implement a tagging system in your notes. For example: #keyboard #macro #wireless #no_rgb

4. **Personal Wiki**:
   Create a personal wiki (like TiddlyWiki) where you can store and interlink your tech preferences and research.

5. **Spreadsheet Database**:
   Maintain a spreadsheet with different tabs for various product categories, where each row represents a set of preferences at a given time.

6. **Mind Mapping Tool**:
   Use a mind mapping tool to create a visual representation of your preferences, linking related concepts.

7. **Custom Web App**:
   If you're tech-savvy, create a simple web app that stores your preferences in a database and allows you to query and update them easily.

8. **AI-Assisted Note-Taking**:
   Use an AI-powered note-taking app that can understand and categorize your preferences based on natural language input.

By using one or a combination of these methods, you can effectively save your specifications for future reference, making it easier to track how your preferences evolve and to quickly revisit them when you're ready to make a purchase decision.
