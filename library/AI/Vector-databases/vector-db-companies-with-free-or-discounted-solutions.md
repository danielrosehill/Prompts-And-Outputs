# Prompt

I'd be interested to know whether any of the vector database providers offer discounted or free offerings for open source projects or MVPs like my idea. Can you think of any that might be a fit?

# Output

Based on your query and the search results, there are indeed some vector database providers that offer discounted or free options suitable for open source projects or MVPs like your Output Hub idea. Here are a few options that might be a good fit:

1. Pinecone:
Pinecone offers a free starter plan, which could be suitable for your MVP stage. According to the search results, they have "transparent, resource-based pricing that puts you in control"[5]. This could allow you to start with minimal costs and scale as your project grows.

2. Qdrant:
Qdrant provides a free and open-source plan, as well as a self-hosted full-featured community support option[5]. This could be an excellent choice for an open source project like yours, allowing you to start with no cost and maintain control over your data.

3. Weaviate:
Weaviate is an open-source vector database[3]. While specific pricing details aren't mentioned in the search results, open-source solutions often have free self-hosted options that could work well for your project.

4. Milvus:
Milvus is another open-source vector database[3]. As with Weaviate, this could provide a cost-effective solution for your MVP, especially if you're comfortable with self-hosting.

5. Chroma:
Chroma is mentioned as an open-source, lightweight vector database that's designed to be easy to set up and use[1]. It can be run embedded within your application, which could be ideal for an MVP.

6. LanceDB:
LanceDB is described as an open-source database for vector-search with persistent storage[3]. It might be worth investigating for your project.

7. Tembo:
While not specifically a vector database, Tembo offers a "Tembo for Startups" program that provides discounts for early-stage startups[4]. They offer Postgres-based data services, and PostgreSQL has vector database capabilities through extensions like pgvector. This could be an option if you want to stick with PostgreSQL and add vector capabilities.

For your Output Hub project, considering its MVP stage and open-source nature, I would recommend looking into Qdrant, Chroma, or Milvus first. These offer free, open-source options that you can self-host, which aligns well with your project's current needs and potential budget constraints.

Remember to evaluate each option based on your specific requirements, such as ease of integration with your existing PostgreSQL setup, performance needs, and long-term scalability. Some of these solutions might offer easy migration paths from PostgreSQL, which could be beneficial as your project grows.
