*Note: this repository consists of the outputs of large language models (LLMs). In many cases, these are unedited or minimally edited. The information provided is for demonstrative purposes only and is intended to highlight constraints and capabilities in LLM applications and prompt engineering strategies.*


# Prompt
Excellent work. Can you take this and edit it a bit? In this edited version, we're going to retain all of the features but we're going to emphasise the use of vector database technology. This outline should emphasise that it's an MVP
# Output

Certainly! I'll edit the specification to emphasize the use of vector database technology and highlight that it's an MVP. Here's the updated version:

# Output Hub MVP: Vector-Enhanced LLM Interaction Management

## Project Overview

Output Hub MVP is an innovative internal CRUD application designed to store, manage, and enhance interactions with large language models using vector database technology. This Minimum Viable Product (MVP) focuses on core functionalities while leveraging the power of vector search for improved retrieval and context management.

## Core Components (MVP)

1. Prompts
2. Outputs
3. Custom agent configurations
4. Vector-based context repository

## Key Features (MVP)

### 1. Vector-Enhanced Prompt Management
- Create, read, update, and delete prompts
- Store prompts as vector embeddings for semantic search
- Relate prompts to their generated outputs automatically

### 2. Output Generation and Vector-Based Storage
- Generate outputs by sending prompts to OpenAI's API
- Store raw outputs as vector embeddings for efficient retrieval
- Provide a basic interface for human editing of outputs

### 3. Simplified Custom Agent Configuration
- Register and manage basic custom LLM agents
- Save essential configuration parameters for each agent
- Associate agents with prompts and outputs using vector similarity

### 4. Vector-Based Tagging System
- Assign tags to prompts, outputs, and agents
- Implement tags as vector embeddings for semantic organization
- Basic filtering of content based on vector similarity to tag embeddings

### 5. User Authentication and API Key Management
- Simple user authentication system
- Secure storage and management of user's OpenAI API keys

### 6. Vector-Based Context Repository (MVP Core Feature)
- Store and manage a basic set of contextual information as vector embeddings
- Implement simple semantic search for context retrieval
- Basic integration of relevant context into LLM prompts
 

## User Interface (Simplified for MVP)

### Main Screens

1. **Vector-Enhanced Prompt Management**
   - List view of prompts with basic similarity search
   - Simple create/edit prompt interface
   - Basic prompt details view with related outputs

2. **Vector-Based Output Management**
   - List view of outputs with similarity search functionality
   - Output details view showing raw version
   - Basic edit interface for outputs

3. **Simple Agent Configuration**
   - List view of custom agents
   - Basic create/edit agent interface

4. **Context Repository Management (MVP Version)**
   - Simple interface to add and view contextual information
   - Basic vector-based search for context retrieval

5. **User Settings**
   - OpenAI API key management
   - Basic user profile settings

### Additional UI Elements
- Simple navigation menu
- Basic vector-based search functionality across all entities
- "Generate Output" button on prompt screens

## Backend Functionality (Vector-Focused)

- RESTful API for basic CRUD operations, emphasizing vector-based retrieval
- Integration with OpenAI API for output generation and embedding creation
- Simple vector similarity search implementation for context and content retrieval
- Secure handling of user API keys

## MVP Development Plan

1. **Project Setup and Vector DB Integration**
   - Set up development environment with PostgreSQL and pgvector
   - Implement basic vector storage and retrieval functions

2. **Core Vector-Based Functionality**
   - Develop prompt and output management with vector embeddings
   - Implement basic vector-based search and similarity matching

3. **Context Repository MVP**
   - Create a simple context storage and retrieval system using vector embeddings
   - Implement basic context integration in LLM prompts

4. **User Interface Development**
   - Build simplified UI components focusing on vector-based features
   - Implement basic screens for prompt, output, and context management

5. **Integration and Testing**
   - Connect frontend with vector-enabled backend API
   - Conduct basic testing of vector search and retrieval functions

6. **Security and Deployment**
   - Implement essential security measures
   - Deploy MVP to a staging environment for initial testing

7. **Final MVP Refinement**
   - Address critical issues identified during testing
   - Optimize vector search performance for MVP scale

8. **MVP Launch**
   - Deploy the MVP to production
   - Gather initial user feedback for future iterations

This MVP specification emphasizes the use of vector database technology while focusing on essential features for a minimum viable product. It sets the foundation for more advanced vector-based functionalities in future versions of Output Hub.
