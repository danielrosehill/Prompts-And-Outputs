# Prompt

Wow. Impressive template. Mostly, though, I'm just asking Claude to develop Python programs which tend to be a single file rather than a codebase. I'm wondering if perhaps we could simplify the template a little to accommodate this need?

# Output

Certainly! I apologize for overlooking that important aspect. Let's modify the structure to include a dedicated space for storing different versions of your script. Here's an updated template that incorporates version storage:

```
project-root/
│
├── ai/
│   ├── prompts/
│   │   ├── initial.txt
│   │   └── refinements/
│   │       ├── refinement_1.txt
│   │       └── refinement_2.txt
│   │
│   ├── responses/
│   │   ├── response_1.py
│   │   └── response_2.py
│   │
│   └── versions/
│       ├── v1/
│       │   └── main_v1.py
│       ├── v2/
│       │   └── main_v2.py
│       └── current/
│           └── main.py
│
├── data/
│
├── tests/
│
├── docs/
│
├── .gitignore
└── README.md
```

## Explanation of Changes

1. **ai/versions/**: This new directory is dedicated to storing different versions of your script.
   - Each version gets its own subdirectory (v1, v2, etc.).
   - The `current/` subdirectory always contains the latest working version.

2. **ai/responses/**: Renamed files to `response_1.py`, `response_2.py`, etc., to differentiate them from versioned scripts.

## Best Practices for Version Management

1. **Version Naming**: 
   - Use a consistent naming convention for version folders (v1, v2, v3, etc.).
   - Name script files consistently within version folders (e.g., `main_v1.py`, `main_v2.py`).

2. **Current Version**: 
   - Always keep the most up-to-date, working version in the `current/` folder.
   - Update `README.md` to reflect which version is current.

3. **Version Documentation**: 
   - Consider adding a `changelog.md` file in the `ai/versions/` directory to track major changes between versions.
   - Add comments at the top of each versioned script explaining key features or changes.

4. **Version Control Integration**: 
   - Use Git commits to capture the creation of new versions.
   - Consider using Git tags to mark significant versions (e.g., `git tag -a v1.0 -m "Version 1.0"`).

5. **Transitioning Versions**: 
   - When moving from a response to a version, copy the file from `ai/responses/` to the appropriate version folder in `ai/versions/`.
   - Make any necessary adjustments or refinements in the versioned file.

6. **Testing Versions**: 
   - If you create version-specific tests, consider adding a `tests/` subdirectory within each version folder.

This structure allows you to maintain a clear history of your script's evolution while keeping the current working version easily accessible. It provides a good balance between organization and simplicity, suitable for single-file Python projects developed with AI assistance.
