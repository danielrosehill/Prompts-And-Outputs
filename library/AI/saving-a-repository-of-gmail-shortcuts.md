# Prompt

I'd love to save a repository of all these Gmail shortcuts. Any recommendations for a good format and way to do that?

# Output

Creating a repository of your Gmail shortcuts and filters can be very helpful for quick reference. Here are some recommended formats and methods to effectively organize and store them:

### 1. **Markdown Document in a Git Repository**
   - **Format**: Use a Markdown file (`gmail_filters.md`) to organize your Gmail shortcuts. Markdown is simple to use and easy to share or update. 
   - **Structure**:
     - Use headers for different categories (e.g., “General Filters,” “Date-Based Filters,” “Keyword Filters”).
     - Include the filters as code blocks for readability.
   - **Example**:
     ```markdown
     # Gmail Shortcuts Repository
     
     ## General Filters
     
     - **Find all bills and invoices with attachments**:
       ```gmail
       has:attachment OR subject:(invoice OR receipt OR "your bill")
       ```
       
     - **Recent Invoices (Last Month)**:
       ```gmail
       newer_than:1m (invoice OR receipt)
       ```

   - **Method**: Create a private Git repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket) to keep it organized and version-controlled. This approach is ideal if you want to regularly update and track changes.

### 2. **Google Keep or Google Drive Document**
   - **Google Keep**: You can use Google Keep to save each filter as an individual note. This allows you to add labels, color-code, and search easily.
   - **Google Docs**: Create a Google Document specifically for your Gmail filters. You can use headings and bullet points to organize them.
   - **Structure**: Similar to Markdown, use headings for categories, and save each shortcut with a description.

### 3. **Notion Database or Page**
   - **Format**: Notion is great for managing various types of data. You could create a **page** or **database** where each filter is its own entry.
   - **Structure**:
     - Create columns for **Name**, **Description**, **Shortcut**, and **Use Case**.
     - Notion also allows you to add tags, link shortcuts to notes, or even create a quick-access dashboard.

### 4. **Spreadsheet for Organizing Filters**
   - **Google Sheets or Excel**:
     - Use columns like **Filter Name**, **Description**, **Syntax**, and **Use Case**.
     - This format makes it easy to quickly search or filter based on type.
   - **Example Structure**:
     | Filter Name          | Description                           | Syntax                                              | Use Case                    |
     |----------------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
     | Recent Invoices      | Finds invoices from the last month    | `newer_than:1m (invoice OR receipt)`                | Monthly review              |
     | Attachments Search   | Finds emails with attachments         | `has:attachment`                                    | Find receipts with files    |
     | General Bill Search  | Bills and invoices with attachments   | `has:attachment OR subject:(invoice OR "your bill")`| Expense tracking            |

### 5. **Personal Knowledge Management Tool (e.g., Obsidian)**
   - **Format**: Tools like **Obsidian** can help create a repository of Gmail shortcuts, organized as **interlinked Markdown files**. This is particularly useful if you want cross-references or if you want to build connections between related filters.
   - **Method**: You could have a main page listing all the filters, then link each filter to a dedicated page that describes it in detail.

### Summary
- **Markdown + Git**: For organized, version-controlled access.
- **Google Docs/Keep**: Simple and easy to access from anywhere.
- **Notion**: Offers good categorization, tagging, and search.
- **Spreadsheet**: If you want to easily sort and filter shortcuts.
- **Obsidian**: For deep linking and note management.
