**Summary of your prompt:** You want to know which infrastructure provisioning tool has the largest user base and can be regarded as the most stable and mature among the tools mentioned, including Cloudron, CapRover, Portainer, YunoHost, and others.

Here's an overview of the relative maturity and user base of these platforms:

### 1. **Portainer**
   - **User Base:** Portainer has a large and active user base, especially among Docker and Kubernetes users. It’s one of the most widely adopted container management platforms.
   - **Stability and Maturity:** Portainer is **very mature** and **enterprise-ready**. It’s been around since 2017 and is frequently used by businesses, both for managing small setups and large-scale Kubernetes clusters.
   - **Why it's stable:** Portainer is backed by a commercial entity (Portainer.io), ensuring long-term support, frequent updates, and strong community engagement. It’s also integrated into enterprise environments for managing containerized applications, which adds to its stability and market presence.

   **Verdict:** Portainer is likely the **most mature and stable** platform, particularly for users who are already working with containers.

### 2. **Cloudron**
   - **User Base:** Cloudron has a sizable and loyal user base, especially among businesses and users looking for easy app deployment without needing in-depth system admin knowledge. While smaller than Portainer’s, its community is focused on using Cloudron as a platform to simplify hosting.
   - **Stability and Maturity:** Cloudron is a mature project, having been launched in 2014. It is actively maintained, with frequent updates and a strong focus on usability and business use cases.
   - **Why it's stable:** Cloudron is maintained by a core team that prioritizes stability, regular updates, and ease of use, making it a solid choice for business environments.

   **Verdict:** Cloudron is **mature and stable**, with a dedicated user base. It may not have the market penetration of Portainer, but it's strong in the niche of easy-to-manage app hosting.

### 3. **CapRover**
   - **User Base:** CapRover has gained significant traction in recent years and has an active, engaged open-source community. It’s particularly popular among developers looking for a Heroku-like experience on a self-hosted platform.
   - **Stability and Maturity:** CapRover is stable, but it’s **younger** compared to Cloudron and Portainer. It has been actively developed since 2018 and is often chosen for its lightweight design and flexibility.
   - **Why it's stable:** Despite being newer, CapRover has a strong development team and active community, and it benefits from being built on top of Docker. It’s well-regarded for its simplicity, but it may not have the extensive enterprise use cases and support that platforms like Portainer offer.

   **Verdict:** CapRover is **mature** and actively developed but slightly less tested in large-scale production environments compared to Portainer.

### 4. **YunoHost**
   - **User Base:** YunoHost has a smaller, more community-focused user base. It’s often used by hobbyists, small teams, or organizations looking for easy, self-hosted solutions.
   - **Stability and Maturity:** YunoHost is stable and has been around since 2012, making it a **mature project**. However, it is more focused on personal or small-scale setups rather than enterprise use.
   - **Why it's stable:** YunoHost’s maturity is supported by its long-standing presence in the open-source world. However, it's less geared toward business environments compared to Cloudron or Portainer.

   **Verdict:** While stable and mature, YunoHost is primarily suited for **small-scale use cases**, and its user base is smaller and less commercially focused.

### 5. **Dokku**
   - **User Base:** Dokku has a moderate user base, particularly among developers looking for a Heroku-style deployment experience on their own infrastructure.
   - **Stability and Maturity:** Dokku is a stable and **well-established** platform, having been launched in 2013. It has seen steady use but remains more niche, with a focus on developers who prefer simplicity and Git-based deployments.
   - **Why it's stable:** Dokku is well-regarded for its simplicity and ease of use for certain types of projects, but it doesn’t have the broad applicability or extensive features of Portainer or Cloudron.

   **Verdict:** Dokku is **mature and stable** but not as widely adopted in large-scale production as Portainer or Cloudron.

### Overall Recommendation:
- **Portainer** stands out as the most mature, widely adopted, and stable solution, especially if you’re looking for a tool with a large user base, strong enterprise focus, and a solid reputation in the container management space.
- **Cloudron** is another strong contender, with a focus on simplifying app hosting for businesses. It’s stable and has a dedicated user base but isn’t as widely used in enterprise environments as Portainer.
- **CapRover** is a solid option for lightweight, flexible deployments, but it’s still growing compared to the larger platforms like Portainer.

If you’re looking for the **largest user base and the most stable and mature** solution, **Portainer** is likely your best bet, particularly if containerized applications are central to your infrastructure. **Cloudron** would be the top choice if you prioritize ease of use for app hosting and management, especially for business use cases.
