# Prompt

I want to ask you anothe wrapper related question. I love working with ChatGPT but I find some aspects of the UI a bit distracting. For instance, I virtually never use the sidebar. Is there any way to create a kind of custom edit of a UI like this that can persist across visits? Like I can make a few changes to the "theme" that only shows for me?

# Output

Creating a custom user interface for ChatGPT that persists across visits is possible using a few techniques, depending on how you want to implement it. Here are some options to consider:

### 1. **Browser Extensions for Custom Styles**
   - **Stylus**: This is a browser extension that allows you to apply custom CSS styles to any website. You can create a style specifically for ChatGPT to hide the sidebar or change the appearance.
     - **Installation**: Download Stylus from the Chrome Web Store or Firefox Add-ons.
     - **Creating a Style**:
       1. Click on the Stylus icon and select "Write new style."
       2. Use a selector to target elements you want to hide or modify. For example, to hide the sidebar:
         ```css
         .sidebar { display: none !important; }
         ```
       3. Save the style, and it will apply automatically every time you visit ChatGPT.

### 2. **User Scripts**
   - **Tampermonkey or Greasemonkey**: These browser extensions allow you to run custom JavaScript on specific web pages. You can write a script to modify the ChatGPT UI, hide elements, or change styles dynamically.
     - **Installation**: Install Tampermonkey from the Chrome Web Store or Greasemonkey for Firefox.
     - **Creating a Script**:
       1. Click on the Tampermonkey icon and select "Create a new script."
       2. Write a script like the following to hide the sidebar:
         ```javascript
         // ==UserScript==
         // @name         Hide ChatGPT Sidebar
         // @namespace    http://tampermonkey.net/
         // @version      0.1
         // @description  Hide the sidebar in ChatGPT
         // @match        https://chat.openai.com/*
         // @grant        none
         // ==/UserScript==

         (function() {
             'use strict';
             const sidebar = document.querySelector('.sidebar');
             if (sidebar) sidebar.style.display = 'none';
         })();
         ```
       3. Save the script, and it will execute whenever you visit the ChatGPT page.

### 3. **Custom Browser Profiles**
   - If you use a browser that supports profiles (like Chrome or Firefox), you can create a separate profile where you customize settings, themes, and extensions specifically for ChatGPT. This keeps your preferences isolated from your main browsing experience.

### 4. **Bookmarklets**
   - You can create a bookmarklet (a small JavaScript program saved as a bookmark) to modify the UI when you click it.
     - **Creating a Bookmarklet**:
       1. Create a new bookmark and name it (e.g., "Hide Sidebar").
       2. Set the URL to a JavaScript snippet like this:
         ```javascript
         javascript:(function() { document.querySelector('.sidebar').style.display = 'none'; })();
         ```
       3. Click the bookmark whenever you visit ChatGPT to execute the script.

### 5. **Using Custom Themes**
   - Some applications allow custom themes or skins. If ChatGPT supports such customization in the future, you can choose or create a theme that suits your preferences.

### 6. **Feedback and Feature Requests**
   - If you find specific features distracting, consider providing feedback directly to OpenAI. They may implement options for UI customization in future updates.

### Conclusion
Using browser extensions like Stylus or Tampermonkey is likely the most effective way to customize the ChatGPT UI to your liking, allowing for persistent changes that only you see. Choose the method that best fits your technical comfort level and requirements!
