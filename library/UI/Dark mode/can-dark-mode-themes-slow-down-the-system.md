No, **dark mode themes** generally do not slow down your computer. The performance impact of dark mode is minimal, especially on modern operating systems and devices. However, the effects can depend on a few factors:

### 1. **Performance on LCD vs. OLED Screens**:
   - **LCD screens**: On devices with LCD screens, dark mode doesn’t significantly affect performance or power usage, since the screen’s backlight remains constant regardless of the color scheme. The theme may have a minor effect on how the GPU renders the interface, but this difference is negligible in terms of performance.
   - **OLED screens**: On devices with OLED screens, dark mode can actually **save power**, since individual pixels emit their own light. With darker pixels, less power is consumed, leading to improved energy efficiency. This power saving can contribute to slightly better performance over time, especially on battery-powered devices.

### 2. **Impact on System Resources**:
   - Dark mode themes use the same system resources as light mode. They do not require additional memory or processing power, so they don't inherently slow down your computer. Any performance differences between dark and light themes are typically imperceptible to users.

### 3. **GPU Rendering**:
   - Some operating systems or applications may use **hardware acceleration** to render UI elements. Dark mode, which involves different color schemes, should not cause any slowdown, as GPUs handle these color changes efficiently. On the contrary, some users have noticed that dark mode can **reduce eye strain** and make long-term use more comfortable, indirectly enhancing user productivity.

### 4. **Individual App Performance**:
   - Some apps may not be fully optimized for dark mode, and this could cause minor performance hiccups, but this is more due to software issues rather than inherent limitations of dark mode itself. Most mainstream apps like browsers and system utilities are now well-optimized for dark mode.

### Conclusion:
For most modern computers, enabling **dark mode** does not slow down the system. In some cases, particularly with OLED displays, it may even improve battery life slightly. The overall performance remains unaffected unless there are specific software bugs related to dark mode, which are generally rare and app-specific.
