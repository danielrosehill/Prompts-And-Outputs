For **KDE Plasma** on **Wayland**, there are several dark mode solutions and customizations available to make the interface and applications more comfortable for night use:

### 1. **Enable Global Dark Theme in KDE Plasma**
KDE Plasma has a built-in global dark theme that can be easily applied to the entire desktop environment.

#### Steps:
1. Open **System Settings**.
2. Go to **Appearance** > **Global Theme**.
3. Choose a dark theme such as **Breeze Dark** or install additional dark themes from the **Get New Global Themes** option.
4. Apply the dark theme, and it will affect system windows and supported applications.

### 2. **Force GTK Applications to Use Dark Theme**
KDE can force **GTK** applications (such as GIMP or Firefox) to follow the dark theme you applied in Plasma.

#### Steps:
1. Open **System Settings**.
2. Navigate to **Application Style** > **GNOME/GTK Application Style**.
3. Under **GTK Themes**, select **Breeze-Dark** (or any other dark theme you prefer).
4. Apply the settings.

### 3. **Night Color Feature (Blue Light Reduction)**
KDE Plasma has a built-in feature called **Night Color**, which reduces blue light to make screen use more comfortable at night.

#### Steps:
1. Open **System Settings**.
2. Go to **Display and Monitor** > **Night Color**.
3. Enable Night Color and configure the schedule for when you want it active (e.g., sunset to sunrise).
4. You can adjust the color temperature to reduce eye strain further.

### 4. **Firefox and Chrome Dark Mode Extensions**
For web browsing, you can install extensions to force dark mode on websites, which works well with the KDE dark theme:

- **Dark Reader**: Available for both Firefox and Chrome, this extension forces dark mode on all websites, making late-night browsing more comfortable.
   - [Dark Reader for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/darkreader/)
   - [Dark Reader for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dark-reader/xxxxxxx)

### 5. **Custom Dark Color Schemes in KDE**
KDE Plasma allows you to create and tweak your own color schemes if you want more control over how the dark mode looks.

#### Steps:
1. Open **System Settings**.
2. Go to **Appearance** > **Colors**.
3. Choose an existing dark color scheme (like Breeze Dark), or create a new one by selecting **Edit** and adjusting the colors manually.
4. Save and apply your custom color scheme.

### 6. **Application-Specific Dark Mode (Qt and GTK Apps)**
Some applications have their own built-in dark mode settings. For example:
- **Firefox**: Navigate to **Settings** > **Extensions & Themes** and choose a dark theme.
- **LibreOffice**: You can enable dark mode by going to **Tools** > **Options** > **View**, and then selecting **Breeze Dark** under the **Icon Style** dropdown.

### 7. **Third-Party Dark Themes**
You can also explore third-party dark themes for KDE Plasma from the **KDE Store**.

- Go to **System Settings** > **Appearance** > **Global Themes**, and click on **Get New Global Themes**.
- Search for dark themes such as **Nord**, **Sweet-Dark**, or **Dracula** to find additional options that suit your aesthetic preferences.

### 8. **Sway (Wayland Compositor) with KDE Plasma**
For users who need a more Wayland-native environment, some prefer using a compositor like **Sway** with KDE Plasma, where you can further customize the appearance, including dark modes and tiling options.

These dark mode options help make **KDE Plasma** and **Wayland** environments more suitable for nighttime use, reducing eye strain and providing a more comfortable experience in low-light conditions.
