You asked about minimizing blue light exposure and whether there is a global dark mode setting that can be applied to all websites or the desktop environment.

### 1. **Global Dark Mode for Websites**
There are ways to apply dark mode globally across all websites you visit:

- **Browser Extensions**: Many browsers support extensions that can force a dark mode across all websites:
  - **Dark Reader**: This popular extension is available for Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari. It applies dark mode to all websites by inverting colors and can be customized for brightness and contrast. You can toggle it on or off for specific sites.
  - **Night Eye**: Similar to Dark Reader, Night Eye applies dark mode across websites and allows fine-tuning for different websites.

These extensions apply dark themes to all web pages, helping to reduce blue light exposure when browsing.

### 2. **Global Dark Mode for the Desktop Environment**
Depending on your operating system, you can enable a system-wide dark mode:

- **Linux**:
  - If you’re using **KDE Plasma** (since you use Fedora with KDE Plasma), there’s a global dark mode setting in the system settings:
    1. Go to **System Settings > Appearance > Global Theme**.
    2. Choose a dark theme, like **Breeze Dark**, and apply it.
    3. To adjust GTK applications (used by GNOME apps), go to **Application Style > Configure GNOME/GTK Application Style** and select a dark theme for GTK apps.
  - Additionally, you can use the **KDE Night Color** feature, which reduces blue light by adjusting screen temperature over time:
    1. **System Settings > Display and Monitor > Night Color** to enable it.
  
- **Windows**:
  - Go to **Settings > Personalization > Colors**, and set the default app mode to **Dark**. This will apply dark mode to all system apps and many third-party apps that support it.
  
- **macOS**:
  - Open **System Preferences > General**, and choose **Dark** under **Appearance** for a system-wide dark theme.
  
- **Night Light Settings**:
  On most desktop environments, you can also reduce blue light by enabling a **Night Light** feature:
  - On **KDE Plasma**, you can activate **Night Color** in **System Settings > Display and Monitor > Night Color** to reduce blue light during the evening hours.
  - On **Windows**, go to **Settings > System > Display**, and enable **Night Light**.
  - On **macOS**, you can use **Night Shift** from **System Preferences > Displays > Night Shift**.

These options give you the flexibility to apply dark modes globally and minimize blue light exposure across your browsing and desktop environments.
