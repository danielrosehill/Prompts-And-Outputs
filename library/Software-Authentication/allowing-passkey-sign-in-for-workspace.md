How do I fix this error in Workspace Your admin has not enabled passkeys for sign in

# Output

To fix the error **"Your admin has not enabled passkeys for sign in"** in Google Workspace, you need to enable **passkeys** as an authentication option in the Google Admin Console. Here's how you can do it:

### Step 1: Access Google Admin Console
1. **Go to the Admin Console**:
   - Visit [admin.google.com](https://admin.google.com) and log in with your **admin account**.

### Step 2: Navigate to Security Settings
1. **Click on "Security"**:
   - From the Admin Console dashboard, click on **"Security"**. If you donâ€™t see this option, click **"More Controls"** at the bottom.

2. **Select "Authentication"**:
   - In the Security section, click on **"Authentication"** to access authentication settings.

### Step 3: Enable Passkeys (Passwordless Sign-In)
1. **Click on "Passkeys"**:
   - Look for the **"Passkeys"** section under **Authentication** settings.

2. **Allow Passkeys for Users**:
   - Toggle the option to **enable passkeys** (sometimes referred to as **"Passwordless Sign-In"** or **"FIDO2 Security Key"**).
   - You can choose to apply this setting to specific **Organizational Units (OUs)** if you only want some users to use passkeys or apply it to **everyone**.

3. **Save Changes**:
   - Click on **"Save"** to apply the settings.

### Step 4: Propagation Time
- Changes may take up to 24 hours to propagate, although they often apply more quickly.

### Step 5: Test Sign-In with Passkeys
1. **Log in to Your Google Account**:
   - Try logging in to your Google Workspace account (`daniel@yourbusiness.cloud`).
   
2. **Enable Passkey on Your Device**:
   - You will now be prompted to add a **passkey** if the feature is successfully enabled. Follow the on-screen instructions to register a passkey (like a **fingerprint**, **Windows Hello**, or other supported biometric/key options).

### Notes:
- **Admin Privileges**: This setting must be changed by a Google Workspace administrator.
- **Security Considerations**: Make sure that enabling passkeys aligns with your organization's security policies.
