# Prompt

I would like to find a way to lay out my Obsidian vault in a way that makes more sense for how I'm currently using it. To brief you on that, I've attached a description of my current vault as context. I think that a grid layout would be very effective, specifically 2 x 2. 

Top left: prompt library. Top right: Outputs/Raw folder (latest notes)

Bottom left: contextual repo. Bottom right: form for saving new outputs into the system

Can you think of any ways to implement this?
# Output

Based on your current Obsidian vault structure and your desire for a more efficient layout, I can suggest a way to implement the 2x2 grid layout you're envisioning. Here's how you could potentially set this up:

## Implementing a 2x2 Grid Layout

### Top Left: Prompt Library

This section would correspond to your existing `/Prompts` folder. You can create a dedicated view or page that displays your prompt library in an easily accessible format. Consider the following:

- Use Obsidian's "Dataview" plugin to create a dynamic list of all prompts[1].
- Implement a tagging system for easy categorization and filtering of prompts.
- Include a search function specifically for the prompt library.

### Top Right: Outputs/Raw Folder (Latest Notes)

This quadrant would display the contents of your `/Outputs/Raw` folder, focusing on the most recent outputs. To implement this:

- Utilize the "Recent Files" core plugin in Obsidian to show the latest notes[1].
- Create a custom view using Dataview that sorts and displays the most recent entries from the `/Outputs/Raw` folder.
- Implement a quick-access system for viewing and editing these recent outputs.

### Bottom Left: Contextual Repository

This section would represent your `/Context` folder. To make this more functional:

- Create a visual interface for browsing and selecting context snippets.
- Implement a tagging system for easy categorization and retrieval of context information.
- Consider using the "Kanban" plugin to organize context snippets into categories or projects[1].

### Bottom Right: Form for Saving New Outputs

This quadrant would be dedicated to your data entry GUI for saving new outputs. To implement this:

- Create a custom form using HTML and JavaScript within an Obsidian note.
- Use the "Templater" plugin to create a standardized template for new outputs[1].
- Implement a button or hotkey that opens this form for quick access.

## Implementation Suggestions

1. **Use Obsidian Workspaces**: Create a custom workspace that arranges these four elements in the desired 2x2 grid layout. You can save this layout and easily switch to it when needed[1].

2. **Leverage Obsidian Plugins**: Utilize plugins like Dataview, Kanban, and Templater to create dynamic views and interactive elements within each quadrant[1].

3. **Custom CSS**: Use custom CSS to style your Obsidian interface, creating visual separations between the quadrants and enhancing the grid-like appearance.

4. **Hotkeys and Shortcuts**: Set up custom hotkeys for quick navigation between the four quadrants and for performing common actions (e.g., creating a new output, accessing the prompt library).

5. **Integration with Existing Structure**: Ensure that this new layout integrates seamlessly with your existing folder structure. The quadrants should serve as views into your current organization system rather than replacing it.

6. **Automated Workflows**: Consider implementing automated workflows using plugins like Templater or custom scripts to streamline the process of creating new outputs and updating the contextual repository[1].

By implementing this 2x2 grid layout, you can create a more intuitive and efficient interface for managing your LLM outputs while maintaining the robust folder structure you've already established. This approach combines the benefits of visual organization with the power of Obsidian's flexibility and plugin ecosystem.
