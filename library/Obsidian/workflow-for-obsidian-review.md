# Prompt

Can you suggest a workflow that I could use tomorrow to go through my backlog of almost 2000 notes in Obsidian. I would like to go through the content and mark up notes for follow up on important notes in that repositry.

# Output

To tackle a backlog of **2000 notes** in **Obsidian**, you need an efficient workflow that helps you quickly identify important items, **mark** them for **follow-up**, and maintain **momentum**. Here’s a practical workflow to help you get through the backlog:

### **Step 1: Set Up Your Workspace for Efficiency**
1. **Create a Tagging System for Follow-Ups**:
   - Create a few **key tags** such as `#urgent`, `#followup`, `#archive`, and `#review`. These tags will help classify notes as you go through them.
2. **Split-Screen View**:
   - Use **split view** in Obsidian to easily compare different notes or keep a reference document open for consistency in tagging.
3. **Use the Command Palette**:
   - Familiarize yourself with **keyboard shortcuts** and **Command Palette** (`Ctrl+P` or `Cmd+P`) to speed up actions like tagging, moving, and linking notes.

### **Step 2: Set Priorities and Goals for Each Session**
1. **Define a Daily Goal**:
   - Set a realistic goal of **processing 100-200 notes per day**. Depending on the complexity of the notes, this may vary, but having a numerical target will keep you motivated.
2. **Time Blocking**:
   - Allocate **90-minute focused work sessions** with breaks in between. Use the **Pomodoro technique** (e.g., 25 minutes work, 5 minutes rest) to maintain focus.
3. **Priority Passes**:
   - First Pass: Quickly skim through the notes to get a sense of what’s important. Use **#review** for notes that need further examination.
   - Second Pass: Revisit the **#review** notes and mark important ones with **#urgent** or **#followup**.

### **Step 3: Sorting and Filtering**
1. **Use Search to Group Notes by Similar Topics**:
   - Use **Obsidian’s search function** to group similar notes (e.g., search by keywords or phrases common in important notes).
   - Process related notes together, making it easier to link ideas or decide on the importance.
2. **Create Custom Views with Obsidian's "Dataview" Plugin**:
   - Use the **Dataview plugin** to create filtered views of notes (e.g., show only notes without follow-up tags).
   - Create a dashboard to easily track notes marked with `#followup` or `#urgent`.

### **Step 4: Rapid Review Workflow**
1. **Tagging for Follow-Up**:
   - Open each note and decide its fate in **30-60 seconds**:
     - **#followup**: Notes that require further action.
     - **#archive**: Notes that are no longer relevant but worth keeping.
     - **#urgent**: High-priority items that need action soon.
2. **Use Inline Comments**:
   - Add **inline comments** (using `%% comment %%`) to quickly annotate why a particular note is important or what kind of follow-up it requires.
3. **Link Related Notes**:
   - Create links between related notes using `[[note-title]]`. This helps consolidate information and group related items for easier reference later.

### **Step 5: Create Follow-Up Actions**
1. **Daily Summary Note**:
   - At the end of each day, create a **daily summary note** with a list of `#urgent` and `#followup` items.
   - Use **Obsidian’s backlinking feature** to link follow-up items to this summary note.
2. **Convert Important Notes to Tasks**:
   - Use **Obsidian’s task syntax** (`- [ ]`) to convert follow-up notes into actionable tasks.
   - Tag these tasks with due dates if possible (`#due/tomorrow`).

### **Step 6: Use Visual Cues to Stay Organized**
1. **Colored Tags**:
   - Use the **Supercharged Links** or **Style Settings** plugin to color-code your tags. This will help visually distinguish between `#urgent`, `#followup`, etc.
2. **Star Important Notes**:
   - Use Obsidian’s **Star feature** to mark very important notes. These notes will appear in your sidebar for easy access.

### **Step 7: Post-Processing and Follow-Up**
1. **Weekly Review**:
   - Dedicate time at the end of the week to go through all notes tagged with `#followup` and decide on specific actions or archive them if they’re no longer needed.
2. **Task Integration**:
   - If you use a task management tool (e.g., **Todoist**, **Trello**), export the tasks from Obsidian to your preferred system to maintain a unified to-do list.

### **Example Workflow in Practice:**
- **Morning (Session 1)**:
  - Review **100 notes**: Skim and tag (`#review`, `#archive`, `#followup`).
- **Midday (Session 2)**:
  - Focus on the `#review` notes: Decide on tags and link related notes.
  - Mark the top **10 notes** as `#urgent`.
- **End of Day**:
  - Create a **daily summary note** of `#urgent` and `#followup` items.
  - Add any actionable items to your task management tool.

### **Tools and Plugins to Assist You**
1. **Dataview Plugin**: Create dynamic views of notes based on tags, making it easier to focus on `#followup` and `#urgent` notes.
2. **QuickAdd Plugin**: Use **QuickAdd** to create shortcuts for frequently used actions, like adding a specific tag.
3. **Workspaces Plugin**: Create a dedicated workspace for reviewing notes, so you don’t lose track of what you’re working on.
4. **Periodic Notes**: Use **Daily Notes** and **Weekly Notes** to track what’s been done and what needs follow-up.

### **Summary**
- **Set Daily Goals**: Aim to process **100-200 notes** per day.
- **Use Tags for Follow-Up**: Create tags like `#urgent`, `#followup`, `#review`, and `#archive`.
- **Quick Decisions**: Spend **30-60 seconds** on each note for initial tagging.
- **Daily Summary Notes**: Create a summary of all notes that need action at the end of each day.
- **Use Plugins**: Leverage tools like **Dataview**, **QuickAdd**, and **Periodic Notes** for efficiency.

This structured approach should help you process your **2000-note backlog** effectively, ensuring that important notes are easily accessible for follow-up. Let me know if you need help implementing any of these steps in Obsidian!
