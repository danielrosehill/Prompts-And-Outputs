# Prompt

For Obsidian, would you recommend 1) using an E2E plugin or 2) using Cryptomator? Which do you think is more secure?

# Output

When considering how to secure your **Obsidian** vault, the choice between using an **end-to-end encryption (E2EE) plugin** or **Cryptomator** comes down to factors like security, convenience, and your workflow. Let’s look at both options to help you decide which is more secure and suitable for your needs.

### **Option 1: Using an E2E Encryption Plugin for Obsidian**

There are plugins available for Obsidian that enable end-to-end encryption for your notes, allowing you to encrypt individual notes or vaults directly within the Obsidian app.

#### **Pros**:
1. **Seamless integration**:
   - Encryption is handled directly within Obsidian, meaning that your notes are encrypted/decrypted automatically as you interact with them. This makes for a smooth experience when editing and reading encrypted notes without needing to leave the Obsidian interface.
2. **E2EE**:
   - End-to-end encryption ensures that your data is encrypted locally on your device and only decrypted on devices with the correct encryption key. This keeps your notes secure during syncing or storage in the cloud.
3. **Convenience**:
   - You won’t need to leave Obsidian or manage external tools. The encryption process is embedded into the Obsidian workflow, making it simpler and faster to access your encrypted content.
4. **Selective encryption**:
   - You can choose to encrypt only sensitive notes, leaving less critical information unencrypted. This makes managing encrypted data easier if you don’t want everything locked down.

#### **Cons**:
1. **Plugin maturity**:
   - As of now, most E2E encryption plugins for Obsidian are third-party and relatively new. This means they may not have been fully audited for security, and bugs or vulnerabilities could exist.
2. **Limited control over encryption standards**:
   - Depending on the plugin, you may not have full control over the encryption algorithm being used, and some plugins might not use the most secure or modern standards like AES-256.
3. **Dependency on Obsidian and plugins**:
   - If the plugin you’re using becomes deprecated or is no longer maintained, you might lose the ability to access your encrypted notes easily. This could create future compatibility issues or lock you into a specific toolchain.

#### **Security Considerations**:
- **Potential for vulnerabilities**: Plugins might not be as rigorously audited as standalone encryption tools, and relying on a relatively new plugin could expose you to unknown risks.
- **Limited algorithm flexibility**: Some plugins might not use the most secure algorithms or might implement encryption poorly. You'll need to ensure that the plugin uses robust encryption standards (e.g., AES-256, RSA-4096).

### **Option 2: Using Cryptomator**

**Cryptomator** is a tool designed to encrypt files in a **transparent vault**. It integrates with cloud services like **Google Drive**, **Dropbox**, or **Backblaze B2**, encrypting files locally before they are uploaded to the cloud.

#### **Pros**:
1. **Strong encryption**:
   - Cryptomator uses **AES-256 encryption** for file encryption and **key stretching** with **scrypt** to protect against brute-force attacks. It has been independently audited and proven to be a secure encryption solution.
2. **Cross-platform support**:
   - Cryptomator works on Windows, macOS, Linux (Fedora-compatible), Android, and iOS. This makes it a versatile choice if you need to access your encrypted Obsidian vault across different devices.
3. **Transparency**:
   - You can store your encrypted Obsidian vault in the cloud and Cryptomator will ensure that **no plaintext files** are exposed. Everything is encrypted before it's uploaded.
4. **File-level encryption**:
   - Each file in the Obsidian vault is encrypted individually, meaning only the files you change are re-uploaded to the cloud. This makes syncing faster than vault-level encryption solutions.
5. **Audited and open-source**:
   - Cryptomator is open-source and has been professionally audited, which provides more trust in its implementation and security compared to a plugin.

#### **Cons**:
1. **External tool**:
   - You have to manage encryption outside of Obsidian, which means using Cryptomator to lock and unlock the vault every time you want to access your notes. This can disrupt your workflow.
2. **Encrypted filenames**:
   - Cryptomator encrypts filenames, which can make browsing your files outside of Obsidian difficult. You won't see the actual file names until the vault is unlocked.
3. **No selective encryption**:
   - Cryptomator encrypts all files in the vault, so you can't selectively encrypt only certain notes. Everything within the vault is encrypted, which may add unnecessary overhead if not all notes require encryption.

#### **Security Considerations**:
- **Proven security**: Cryptomator has been rigorously tested and uses robust, widely accepted encryption standards (AES-256 and scrypt), ensuring that your data is well-protected.
- **Stronger than a plugin**: Since Cryptomator is a standalone encryption tool and has undergone thorough auditing, it is generally considered more secure than relying on a third-party plugin in Obsidian that might not have the same security guarantees.

### **Which is More Secure?**

From a **pure security perspective**, **Cryptomator** is likely the better choice because:
- **Proven encryption standards**: Cryptomator uses **AES-256**, a widely recognized encryption standard used by governments and large enterprises, and its open-source nature has allowed it to be **audited and validated** for security.
- **Independent of Obsidian or third-party plugins**: Cryptomator is not tied to Obsidian or a specific app, meaning that if Obsidian or an encryption plugin has vulnerabilities or is discontinued, you can still access your encrypted files through Cryptomator.

While an **E2E plugin** within Obsidian is more convenient for everyday use, it may not offer the same level of **proven security** as Cryptomator. Plugins might not have been as extensively tested, and their encryption implementations might be less reliable. If you're very security-conscious, Cryptomator's independent encryption of the entire vault is generally a more trusted solution.

### **Conclusion: Which Should You Choose?**
- **For Maximum Security**: **Cryptomator** is the better choice due to its robust, audited encryption system and its independence from Obsidian’s ecosystem.
- **For Convenience**: An **Obsidian E2E plugin** is easier to use if you prefer an integrated, seamless encryption experience directly within the Obsidian app, but you need to verify that the plugin uses strong encryption standards.
