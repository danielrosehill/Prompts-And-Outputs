# Prompt

Yes, I remember your project for "GPT Workbench." Pivoting this for use in Obsidian is a great idea, and with its powerful markdown and folder structure capabilities, you can effectively organize and manage your GPT-related content.

### File Structure for Obsidian GPT Workbench

Here’s a suggested file structure that you can use in Obsidian:

#### 1. **Root Folder: `GPT Workbench`**
   - This is the main folder where all your GPT-related content will be stored.

#### 2. **Subfolder: `Prompts`**
   - **Purpose**: Store all your prompts.
   - **Structure**:
     - `Prompts/Active Prompts` – For prompts that are currently in use or that you frequently revisit.
     - `Prompts/Archived Prompts` – For older prompts that are no longer actively used but are kept for reference.
     - `Prompts/Prompt Templates` – For reusable prompt templates.
     - `Prompts/Prompt Ideas` – For brainstorming and storing new prompt ideas.
   
#### 3. **Subfolder: `Outputs`**
   - **Purpose**: Store the outputs generated by GPT.
   - **Structure**:
     - `Outputs/By Date` – Organized by date (e.g., `Outputs/2024-09-25`).
     - `Outputs/By Project` – Organized by specific projects or topics.
     - `Outputs/Favorites` – For your favorite or most useful outputs.
   
#### 4. **Subfolder: `Prompt Library`**
   - **Purpose**: This could be where you automatically copy prompts, potentially using Obsidian plugins or manual management.
   - **Structure**:
     - `Prompt Library/Topic-based` – Organized by specific topics or categories.
     - `Prompt Library/Format-based` – Categorized by different formats or types of prompts (e.g., `Interview Prompts`, `Content Creation Prompts`, etc.).
   
#### 5. **Subfolder: `Notes`**
   - **Purpose**: General notes related to your GPT workbench, including thoughts, reflections, and insights.
   - **Structure**:
     - `Notes/Reflections` – For your reflections on the prompts and outputs.
     - `Notes/Ideas` – For ideas and insights that arise during your work.
   
#### 6. **Subfolder: `Logs`**
   - **Purpose**: Track the history of your interactions with GPT.
   - **Structure**:
     - `Logs/Daily Logs` – Keep a daily log of your interactions, including which prompts were used and the outputs generated.
     - `Logs/Session Logs` – Track individual sessions if you have specific projects or long sessions with GPT.
   
#### 7. **Subfolder: `Projects`**
   - **Purpose**: Organize outputs and prompts by specific projects.
   - **Structure**:
     - `Projects/Project Name` – Each project would have its folder containing relevant prompts, outputs, notes, and logs.
   
#### 8. **Subfolder: `References`**
   - **Purpose**: Store references, resources, or research that inform your GPT prompts or projects.
   - **Structure**:
     - `References/Articles` – Save articles or research.
     - `References/Books` – Store book notes or summaries.
     - `References/Websites` – Collect useful links.

### Automating Prompt Copying

For automating the process of copying prompts into the `Prompt Library` folder, you could:

1. **Obsidian Templates**: Use the Obsidian Templater plugin to create a template that automatically adds a new prompt to the `Prompt Library` when you create a prompt in your `Active Prompts` folder.

2. **Obsidian Workflows**: Set up a workflow using the Obsidian Dataview plugin to track and display prompts across your vault, allowing easy copying or moving between folders.

3. **External Scripting**: If you’re familiar with scripting, you could write a script that runs periodically to copy any new prompts from the `Prompts/Active Prompts` folder to the `Prompt Library`.

This setup should give you a solid starting point to organize and manage your GPT work within Obsidian.# ## Extracted Prompts
