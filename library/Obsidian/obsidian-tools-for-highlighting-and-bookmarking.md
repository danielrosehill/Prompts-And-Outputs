# Prompt

are there any tools in obsidian for creating highlights and bookmarks on notes?

# Output

Based on the information provided in the forum discussions, here are some key points about highlights and bookmarks in Obsidian:

1. Built-in highlighting:
- Obsidian has basic built-in highlighting functionality using ==double equals==
- However, this is limited to a single color and doesn't support annotations

2. Plugins for enhanced highlighting:
- The "Highlightr" plugin allows for multiple highlight colors, but uses HTML tags
- "Extract Highlights" plugin can extract highlighted text, but has some limitations

3. Bookmarks:
- Obsidian has a built-in bookmarks feature for notes, searches, and graphs
- You can bookmark specific blocks in notes

4. Linking to bookmarks:
- There's no native way to create inline links to bookmarks 
- You can link to specific blocks using block references
- There are workarounds for linking to bookmarked searches

5. Annotations:
- No native annotation feature
- Some users add comments after highlights using or HTML comments

6. Requests for improvement:
- Multiple highlight colors
- Better annotation support
- Improved management and export of highlights/annotations
- Ability to link directly to bookmarks within notes

While Obsidian has some basic functionality for highlights and bookmarks, many users are looking for more advanced features in these areas. Currently, plugins and workarounds are used to enhance these capabilities.
