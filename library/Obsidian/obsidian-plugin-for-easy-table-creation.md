**Summary of your prompt**: You're asking if there is an Obsidian plugin that allows you to create tables visually.

Yes, there is a plugin called **"Advanced Tables"** in Obsidian that provides some visual and user-friendly ways to work with tables. While it doesn't offer a full drag-and-drop or visual table editor like a spreadsheet, it improves the experience by adding shortcuts and commands for inserting and managing Markdown tables.

Features include:
- Easily adding and removing rows or columns.
- Formatting the tables for easier readability.
- Alignment options for text within table cells.

Another option is the **"Obsidian Table Editor"** plugin, which offers a more interactive interface for table creation and manipulation. This plugin provides:
- A modal window where you can type in data and see it displayed in a more intuitive, spreadsheet-like format.
- Options to insert, delete, and reorder rows/columns visually.

These plugins improve the usability of tables, but they still work within the Markdown framework rather than providing a full graphical table editor. You can install these plugins from the Community Plugins section in Obsidian.
