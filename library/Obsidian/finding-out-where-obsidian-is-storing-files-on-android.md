To find out where Obsidian is storing your vault files on Android and check the storage it's using, you can follow these steps:

1. Locate the Vault Directory:

Open Obsidian.

Tap the three dots menu in the top-right corner.

Go to Settings > Vault.

The vault location path should be displayed here, showing where the files are stored on your Android device.
2. Check File Storage Usage:

Use a file manager app (like Files by Google or any built-in file manager on your device).

Navigate to the folder where the vault is stored (based on the path found in Obsidian).

Once inside the folder, you can check the folderâ€™s properties to see the total storage space being used.

In most file managers, you can tap and hold the folder, then select Details or Properties to view the folder size.

3. System Storage Settings:

Alternatively, you can go to Settings > Storage on your Android device.

Look under Apps or Files to find the space used by Obsidian or by specific folders.


This should give you a good idea of where the files are located and how much space they are taking up. Let me know if you need further guidance!
