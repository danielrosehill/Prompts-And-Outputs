To streamline the process of **reviewing a large folder of notes** in **Obsidian** and to help identify and bookmark the important ones more easily, you can make use of a few powerful plugins designed to improve navigation, note curation, and review workflows. Here are some Obsidian plugins that would be especially helpful for your use case:

### 1. **Review Plugin**
- **Purpose**: Helps with systematically reviewing notes, especially useful for maintaining spaced repetition.
- **How It Helps**: You can mark notes for review directly and schedule them for later. This plugin is great for systematically going through a folder of notes to mark the important ones.
- **Usage**:
  - You can set the notes for review one by one.
  - It allows you to add a tag like `#review` to quickly identify notes you have already seen, making it easy to separate those that need further attention.

### 2. **Obsidian Workspaces Plugin**
- **Purpose**: Saves the current state of Obsidian (open files, panes, etc.) so you can revisit your workspace as you left it.
- **How It Helps**: By using workspaces, you can set up a dedicated review environment. For example:
  - You could load all notes from your target folder and keep track of where you left off in the review.
  - Create a workspace that filters only the notes that have been reviewed or need to be reviewed.

### 3. **Note Refactor Plugin**
- **Purpose**: Helps break down, manage, and navigate large notes.
- **How It Helps**: You can refactor notes as you go through them, breaking down complex or large notes into smaller, more manageable sections, while also tagging those that need further attention. This could help in creating a sort of summary or "important points" document for notes you consider essential.

### 4. **Review Queue Plugin**
- **Purpose**: Designed specifically to make it easier to systematically go through a list of notes and mark them.
- **How It Helps**: It provides a "queue" mechanism where you can queue up all the notes from a folder for review, allowing you to navigate from one note to the next without having to manually click each one from the file explorer.
- **Usage**:
  - Adds buttons to mark notes as "complete" or "important," making it easy to decide what action to take on each note.
  - You can create a list of notes to prioritize or save them for further review in one go.

### 5. **QuickAdd Plugin**
- **Purpose**: Adds commands to help you quickly create new notes or bookmark existing ones.
- **How It Helps**: You can create a **custom macro** that:
  - Adds a tag (e.g., `#important`) or moves the note to a different folder when you decide it needs to be bookmarked.
  - This way, during your review, you just need to use a hotkey or quick action to mark notes as important.

### 6. **Advanced Slides**
- **Purpose**: Helps in turning notes into slide decks, making it easier to summarize key points.
- **How It Helps**: While not directly related to bookmarking, this plugin could be helpful to review content from important notes in a presentation format, which could make it easier to prioritize information and categorize it.

### 7. **Smart Connections Plugin**
- **Purpose**: Focuses on linking related notes.
- **How It Helps**: While reviewing your notes, it can help surface related notes or highlight connections that might be important. This could be helpful to see which notes are more interconnected, potentially making them more significant.

### **Workflow Suggestion**
- **Initial Setup**:
  1. Use **Review Queue Plugin** to create a list of all notes in the folder.
  2. As you review each note, use **QuickAdd Plugin** to tag the important ones (e.g., `#important`) or move them to a specific folder.
- **Bookmarking**:
  - Create a workspace using **Workspaces Plugin** that only shows notes marked `#important` or in a designated folder, allowing easy access to notes that need further action or referencing.
- **Organizing Output**:
  - Use **Note Refactor Plugin** to break down overly complex notes during your review process.
  - You could also create a summarized note to gather all the key points found during the review.
