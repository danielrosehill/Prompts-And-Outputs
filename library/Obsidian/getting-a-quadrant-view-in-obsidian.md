# Prompt

What about a quadrant view - a split pane vertically and one horizontally?

# Output

Yes, you can create a **quadrant view** in Obsidian by splitting the workspace both vertically and horizontally. This will allow you to have four panes open at the same time. Here's how to set up a quadrant (4-pane) view:

### Steps to Create a Quadrant View in Obsidian:

1. **Open the First Pane**:
   - Start with a single note open in your workspace.

2. **Split Vertically**:
   - Click the **three dots** on the note tab or right-click the tab and choose **"Split vertically."**
   - Now, you have two vertical panes.

3. **Split Each Pane Horizontally**:
   - Go to one of the two vertical panes.
   - Again, click the **three dots** or right-click the tab and choose **"Split horizontally."**
   - Repeat this for the other vertical pane.

4. **Resizing the Panes**:
   - You can resize the panes by dragging the divider between them to adjust each oneâ€™s size to your preference.

After completing these steps, you will have a **quadrant view** with four notes or documents open in a grid format, two on top and two on the bottom. This setup is particularly useful for multitasking, comparing notes, or managing different sets of content simultaneously.
