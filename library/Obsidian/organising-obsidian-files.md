# Prompt
i have a folder full of markdown files in obsidian recording my custom GPTs and outputs and prompts. I'm trying to think of ways to organise them. my instinct was to use a subfolder based approach. would that work? Could an AI tool help me to do that? Or are there better ways?

# Output
A subfolder-based approach can work well for organizing your markdown files in Obsidian, especially if you have a clear idea of how you want to categorize them. Here are a few strategies you might consider:

### 1. **Subfolder Organization**:
   - **By Type**: Create subfolders like "GPTs," "Prompts," and "Outputs." This way, you can easily navigate based on the content type.
   - **By Project or Theme**: If your GPTs, prompts, and outputs are tied to specific projects or themes, create subfolders based on those categories.
   - **By Date**: If you frequently create new content, organizing by date (e.g., "2024_09", "2024_08") can help keep track of when things were made.

### 2. **Tagging System**:
   - In addition to using subfolders, you can implement a consistent tagging system within your markdown files. Tags like `#prompt`, `#output`, `#project_name` can be used to cross-reference files across different folders.

### 3. **Obsidian's Built-in Tools**:
   - **Backlinks** and **Graph View**: Use Obsidian's backlinks and graph view features to create a network of related notes. Even if files are in different subfolders, you can see their connections.
   - **Templates**: If you frequently create similar content, use Obsidian's template feature to maintain consistency across your files.

### 4. **AI Tools for Organization**:
   - **rclone with AI-based tools**: While `rclone` itself is not AI-driven, you can use AI-powered sorting or tagging tools before organizing your files in Obsidian. AI can help auto-tag or categorize files based on their content.
   - **Hugging Face Projects**: There are AI models available that can help with text classification, summarization, or keyword extraction. You could run these on your markdown files to auto-generate tags or suggest subfolder structures based on the content.

### 5. **Custom Scripts or GPTs**:
   - If you're comfortable with coding, you could write a script that uses an AI model to scan your markdown files and suggest an organizational structure. This could be as simple as keyword extraction or as complex as topic modeling.

### 6. **Obsidian Plugins**:
   - Look into Obsidian plugins that might assist in organization, such as "Dataview," which allows you to create dynamic views of your notes based on metadata.

In summary, a subfolder-based approach is a solid foundation. Combining it with tagging and possibly AI tools for auto-categorization can give you a more powerful and flexible organization system. Obsidian's features, along with these strategies, should give you a robust way to manage your files effectively.## Extracted Prompts
