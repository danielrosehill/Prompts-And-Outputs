The information provided is for demonstrative purposes only and is intended to highlight constraints and capabilities in LLM applications and prompt engineering strategies.*


# Prompt

As you know, I'm using Obsidian to store a vault of LLM outputs. It's at about 1600 files now. Each file is a saved markdown document. I'm already noticing that the system is starting to struggle with retrieval which is surprising to me. For instance, I'm trying currently to find an output I saved about AI email assistants. You recommended some great ones. But when I search for that keyword, Obsidian's native search retrieves a bunch of results that are not relevant and I can't find the output that I'm looking for. Do you have any suggestions for more powerful search engines I could use? Obsidian is locally and I run Fedora which might create some constraints. It occurred to me that I don't need to use Obsidian itself for search. Part 2: when I finally get around to hosting this in the cloud on a database, what kind of search tools might I want to start thinking about? I didn't expect that this would be an issue at such a small level of scale!

# Output

It sounds like you're encountering the common limitations of text search within a markdown-based system like Obsidian as your vault grows. Here are some suggestions for improving search capabilities both locally and in the cloud:

### Part 1: Enhanced Local Search Options

1. **Ripgrep**:
   - **Description**: A fast command-line search tool that recursively searches your current directory for a regex pattern. It is highly efficient and can quickly sift through large volumes of text files.
   - **Usage**: You can use it directly in the terminal like this:
     ```bash
     rg "AI email assistants" /path/to/your/ObsidianVault
     ```

2. **DocFetcher**:
   - **Description**: An open-source desktop search application that indexes files on your computer and allows for full-text search.
   - **Features**: It supports various file types, including markdown, and provides a user-friendly interface for searching.
   - **Installation**: Download from [DocFetcher’s website](http://docfetcher.sourceforge.net/en/index.html).

3. **The Silver Searcher (ag)**:
   - **Description**: Similar to Ripgrep but often faster for large codebases. It is optimized for searching code and text files.
   - **Usage**: You can use it similarly to Ripgrep:
     ```bash
     ag "AI email assistants" /path/to/your/ObsidianVault
     ```

4. **fzf (Fuzzy Finder)**:
   - **Description**: A command-line fuzzy finder that can be combined with grep to create a powerful search tool.
   - **Usage**: You can use it to filter results interactively:
     ```bash
     grep -r "AI email assistants" /path/to/your/ObsidianVault | fzf
     ```

5. **Markdown Indexer**:
   - **Description**: Consider using a markdown-specific indexing tool or script that can parse markdown files and create a searchable index. This might involve some initial setup but can greatly enhance search capabilities.

### Part 2: Cloud Database Search Tools

When you move to a cloud database, there are several search tools and strategies to consider:

1. **Elasticsearch**:
   - **Description**: A powerful, distributed search and analytics engine. It's highly scalable and supports full-text search, making it suitable for large datasets.
   - **Integration**: You can index your markdown content in Elasticsearch and perform complex queries with high performance.

2. **Apache Solr**:
   - **Description**: An open-source search platform built on Apache Lucene. Solr provides powerful search capabilities, including faceted search, filtering, and geospatial search.
   - **Use Cases**: Suitable for applications that require complex search features.

3. **MeiliSearch**:
   - **Description**: A lightweight, fast, open-source search engine designed for instant and relevant search experiences. It’s easy to set up and use.
   - **Integration**: Great for adding search functionality to applications, providing full-text search capabilities with typo tolerance.

4. **Typesense**:
   - **Description**: An open-source search engine optimized for speed and relevance. It offers a simple API for integration and instant search results.
   - **Use Cases**: Useful for building search features in websites and applications.

5. **PostgreSQL Full-Text Search**:
   - **Description**: If you're using PostgreSQL for your database, it has built-in full-text search capabilities. You can index the content of your markdown files directly within the database.
   - **Usage**: Create a text search index and use SQL queries to perform full-text searches on the content.

### Summary
For local searches, tools like Ripgrep, DocFetcher, and The Silver Searcher can significantly enhance your search capabilities without needing to rely solely on Obsidian. When transitioning to a cloud-hosted database, consider leveraging powerful search engines like Elasticsearch or Solr to provide robust, efficient search functionality.

If you have any specific preferences or need further details on any of these options, feel free to ask!
