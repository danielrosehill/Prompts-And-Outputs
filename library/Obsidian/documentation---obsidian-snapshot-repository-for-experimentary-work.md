### Knowledge Document: Obsidian Vault Snapshots Repository

**Repository**: [Obsidian Vault Snapshots](https://github.com/danielrosehill/Obsidian-Vault-Snapshots)

#### Purpose
The purpose of the **Obsidian Vault Snapshots** repository is to store **point-in-time snapshots** of Daniel Rosehill’s Obsidian knowledge vault. Each snapshot captures the state of the knowledge vault at a particular moment, preserving it for historical reference and programmatic analysis. By maintaining snapshots over time, this repository allows for structured exploration of knowledge evolution and can serve as an analytical foundation for various exploratory projects.

#### Usage as a Git Submodule
To use this repository as a submodule in future projects, follow the steps below to link it directly within your project’s file structure. This setup is particularly useful for projects that need to access or analyze the knowledge snapshots in tandem with other code and data.

##### Adding as a Submodule
Run the following commands to add this repository as a submodule to an existing Git project:

```bash
# Navigate to your project’s root directory
cd /path/to/your-project

# Add the Obsidian Vault Snapshots repository as a submodule
git submodule add https://github.com/danielrosehill/Obsidian-Vault-Snapshots.git obsidian_snapshots

# Initialize and update the submodule
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

#### Accessing Submodule Content
Once added, the submodule’s contents will be available within the `obsidian_snapshots` folder. You can access each snapshot as needed by navigating through the directory or by using Git commands to check out specific versions within the snapshot repository.

##### Keeping the Submodule Updated
To pull the latest changes from the snapshots repository, run:

```bash
cd obsidian_snapshots
git pull origin main
```

This will keep your local submodule in sync with the latest snapshots.

#### Removing the Submodule
If you need to remove the submodule in the future, use the following commands:

```bash
# Remove the submodule entry from .gitmodules and the main repository
git submodule deinit -f obsidian_snapshots
git rm -f obsidian_snapshots
rm -rf .git/modules/obsidian_snapshots
```
