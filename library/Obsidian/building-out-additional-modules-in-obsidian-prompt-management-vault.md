# Prompt

Let's do a little bit of ideation for how to make my Obsidian vault for storing prompts and outputs more useful. I think I've mapped out all the "core" folders I may wish to incorporate into my system. Can you help me to flesh out the directory structure a little bit to integrate some modules that could help me keep reference information and other additions to the system?
