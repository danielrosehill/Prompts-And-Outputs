Yes, in **Obsidian**, you can easily hide the sidebar with a few options:

1. **Using the Sidebar Toggle Buttons**:
   - Obsidian provides two small arrow buttons at the top of the left and right sidebars.
   - Click these arrows to hide or show the sidebar.

2. **Using Keyboard Shortcuts**:
   - **Hide/Show Left Sidebar**: Press `Ctrl/Cmd + E`.
   - **Hide/Show Right Sidebar**: Press `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + E`.

These shortcuts and buttons will allow you to quickly manage the sidebars in your Obsidian workspace. You can also customize these shortcuts in the Obsidian settings under **Settings > Hotkeys** if needed.
