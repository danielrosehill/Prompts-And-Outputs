Prompt: I am looking for a powerful knowledge management tool which supports markdown and custom post types and taxonomies so that data can be easily interlinked. I would need a tool that makes it easy to capture knowledge and review it. I would like a tool that is available both on the desktop and via a web UI. For every tool that you find please mention how it handles user backups as being able to backup my data (and preserve the relationships) is key. Can you think of any tools that meet this specification?
