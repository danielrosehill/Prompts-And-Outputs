# Prompt

What about doing this at the desktop level (for me Fedora). So is there a way to automatically convert markdown to RTF (or HTML) using the clipboard? Ie, it's converted as soon as it's captured?

# Output

To automatically convert Markdown to RTF or HTML at the desktop level (on Fedora), you can achieve this by setting up a clipboard manager or a script that watches the clipboard and converts Markdown to RTF or HTML upon copying. Here's how you could approach it:

### 1. **Using `xclip` or `xsel` with a Custom Script**
You can write a custom shell script that monitors the clipboard, converts any Markdown content to HTML or RTF using a tool like **Pandoc**, and then places the converted content back on the clipboard.

#### Example Workflow:
- **Step 1**: Copy Markdown to the clipboard.
- **Step 2**: The script intercepts the clipboard content, checks if it is Markdown, and converts it using **Pandoc**.
- **Step 3**: The converted content (HTML or RTF) is placed back on the clipboard.

#### Example Script:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Monitor clipboard content using xclip
while true; do
    # Get the content from the clipboard
    CLIPBOARD_CONTENT=$(xclip -selection clipboard -o)

    # Check if content is Markdown (you can implement more sophisticated checks)
    if [[ "$CLIPBOARD_CONTENT" == *"#"* || "$CLIPBOARD_CONTENT" == *"*"* ]]; then
        # Convert the Markdown to HTML using Pandoc
        CONVERTED_CONTENT=$(echo "$CLIPBOARD_CONTENT" | pandoc -f markdown -t html)

        # Place the converted content back on the clipboard
        echo "$CONVERTED_CONTENT" | xclip -selection clipboard
    fi
    
    # Add a sleep delay to avoid constantly running the loop
    sleep 1
done
```

- **Dependencies**: 
   - Install **Pandoc** to handle the conversion: `sudo dnf install pandoc`.
   - Install **xclip**: `sudo dnf install xclip` (or use `xsel` if preferred).

### 2. **Using Clipboard Managers**
Some clipboard managers offer the ability to filter and transform clipboard content. While this feature is rare, you could look for Linux clipboard managers that support custom actions or scripts.

### 3. **Advanced: Use `autocutsel` for Auto Conversion**
You could use **autocutsel** to synchronize clipboard selections (between primary and clipboard buffers) and hook your conversion script into that process. This requires more configuration but could streamline the automatic conversion across all clipboard activities.

### 4. **Python Approach with `pyperclip`** (for more customization)
If you prefer more control, you could write a Python script that uses the `pyperclip` library to manage the clipboard, combined with **Pandoc** to perform the Markdown-to-HTML or RTF conversion.

#### Python Script Example:
```python
import pyperclip
import time
import subprocess

def convert_markdown_to_html(markdown_text):
    # Convert using pandoc
    process = subprocess.Popen(['pandoc', '-f', 'markdown', '-t', 'html'], 
                               stdin=subprocess.PIPE, stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
    html_output, _ = process.communicate(input=markdown_text.encode())
    return html_output.decode()

previous_text = ""

while True:
    # Get clipboard content
    clipboard_text = pyperclip.paste()
    
    if clipboard_text != previous_text:
        if "#" in clipboard_text or "*" in clipboard_text:
            html_text = convert_markdown_to_html(clipboard_text)
            pyperclip.copy(html_text)
            previous_text = clipboard_text
    
    time.sleep(1)
```

- **Dependencies**: 
   - Install `pyperclip`: `pip install pyperclip`.
   - Install **Pandoc** as mentioned earlier.

### Conclusion:
To automatically convert Markdown to RTF or HTML upon copying in Fedora, the combination of a clipboard monitoring tool (like `xclip` or a clipboard manager) and a converter (such as **Pandoc**) should work well. The solution could range from a custom script to more advanced clipboard managers that support this type of content transformation.
