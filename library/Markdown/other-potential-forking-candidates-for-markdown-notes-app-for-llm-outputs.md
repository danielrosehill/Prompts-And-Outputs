# Prompt
Notable is a good forking suggestion because it's pretty minimalistic. Can you think of any other projects that I could fork for this purpose? What's the proper protocol when creating forks of existing projects? Do you need to notify the original project team of what you're building?

# Output
Notable is indeed a good choice for forking due to its minimalistic and focused approach. Here are a few other markdown-centric projects that are minimalistic and could serve as a good starting point for your app:

### **Additional Projects to Consider for Forking**

   - **License**: Various licenses depending on the components, mostly permissive.
   - **GitHub**: [Inkdrop on GitHub](https://github.com/inkdropapp)

### **Protocol for Forking Existing Projects**

When forking an open-source project, it's important to follow certain protocols and best practices to ensure that you respect the original authors' work and maintain good community relations. Here’s how to approach it:

#### **1. Understand the License**
   - **Read the License**: Before you fork, thoroughly read the license under which the project is distributed. Common licenses like MIT, GPL, and Apache have specific requirements for forks.
   - **Adhere to License Terms**: Ensure that your fork complies with all the terms of the license, including attribution, open-sourcing derivative work (if required), and any other stipulations.

#### **2. Fork the Project on GitHub**
   - **Use GitHub’s Fork Feature**: Fork the repository directly using GitHub’s fork button. This will create a copy of the repository under your account.
   - **Clone Your Fork Locally**: Clone your forked repository to your local development environment to start working on it.

#### **3. Notify the Original Project Team (Optional but Recommended)**
   - **Reach Out**: While not strictly required, it's considered good etiquette to notify the original project maintainers about your fork, especially if you plan to make significant changes or if you intend to commercialize it.
   - **Credit the Original Authors**: In your project's README and other documentation, clearly state that your project is a fork of the original and provide links back to the original repository.

#### **4. Modify and Build**
   - **Customize the Code**: Begin modifying the codebase to fit your needs. Add new features, optimize the performance, or simplify the UI as required.
   - **Rename the Project**: If you’re creating a distinct product, rename the project and adjust branding to differentiate it from the original.
   - **Document Changes**: Keep track of changes you make, especially if you plan to contribute some of these changes back to the original project.

#### **5. Release Your Fork**
   - **Open Source Your Fork**: If the original project is under a copyleft license (like GPL), you’re required to release your modifications as open-source. Even if it’s under a permissive license (like MIT), open-sourcing your fork can help build a community around your project.
   - **Provide Attribution**: Always include attribution to the original project, typically in the README file or other documentation.

#### **6. Community Interaction**
   - **Contribute Back**: If your fork includes bug fixes or improvements that could benefit the original project, consider contributing them back via pull requests.
   - **Engage with Users**: Be prepared to manage issues, pull requests, and feature requests from users of your forked project.

### **Summary**
Forking a project like Notable or one of the other minimalistic markdown apps mentioned above could be a great way to kickstart your idea. The amount of work involved will depend on how closely the existing project aligns with your vision and how much customization is needed.

Following the proper protocol when forking ensures that you respect the original authors’ work and helps foster a positive open-source community. By notifying the original project maintainers, giving proper attribution, and adhering to the licensing terms, you can build a fork that both benefits from and contributes to the broader open-source ecosystem.

# Input
Yes, you would likely save a considerable amount of time and effort by forking an existing project compared to starting your project from scratch. Here are some reasons why:

### **1. Established Foundation**
   - **Pre-existing Codebase**: Forking a project gives you access to an established codebase, including core features, a functioning UI, and backend systems. You won’t need to spend time building these foundational elements from scratch.
   - **Tested and Stable**: The original project has likely been tested by its community, and any major bugs or issues may already have been resolved, saving you debugging time.

### **2. Core Features Already Implemented**
   - **Markdown Rendering**: Markdown parsing and rendering is already implemented in projects like Notable, Joplin, or Simple Notes. This feature alone can save you significant development time.
   - **Basic CRUD Operations**: Many of these apps have basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in place, which you can adapt for your needs.
   - **File Handling**: Handling markdown files, including reading, writing, and organizing them, is already taken care of in these projects.

### **3. UI/UX Already Developed**
   - **User Interface**: The basic UI/UX is already in place, allowing you to focus on customizing it rather than building it from scratch.
   - **Cross-platform Support**: If the original project is cross-platform (like many Electron-based apps), you inherit this feature, allowing your fork to run on multiple operating systems without additional work.

### **4. Documentation and Community Support**
   - **Existing Documentation**: Many open-source projects have documentation that can help you understand the codebase quickly. This can be invaluable as you begin modifying the project.
   - **Community and Issues**: The original project’s community can be a resource for solving problems you might encounter. You can also review existing issues and discussions for insights.

### **5. Faster MVP Development**
   - **Quick Iteration**: By building on an existing project, you can create a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) much faster. This allows you to test your concept, gather feedback, and iterate more quickly than if you were developing everything from scratch.

### **6. Reduced Development Costs**
   - **Lower Development Time**: Since many features are already built, the overall development time is reduced, which also reduces costs if you’re hiring developers or working with a team.
   - **Focus on Custom Features**: Instead of spending time on basic features, you can focus on implementing the unique features that differentiate your project.

### **7. Incremental Improvements**
   - **Gradual Customization**: You can make incremental changes to the existing codebase, which is often easier and less risky than building and testing new systems from scratch.

### **8. Less Technical Debt**
   - **Proven Solutions**: Using proven solutions from an existing project can reduce the technical debt you incur compared to experimenting with new code.

### **Considerations**
   - **Complexity of Modifications**: If the existing project is significantly different from your vision, the time spent modifying it might approach or even exceed the time needed to build a simpler version from scratch.
   - **License Compliance**: Ensure you comply with the original project’s license when modifying and distributing your fork.

### **When Starting from Scratch Might Be Better**
   - **Highly Unique Features**: If your project requires highly unique features or a radically different architecture, starting from scratch might be more efficient.
   - **Complete Control**: Starting from scratch gives you full control over every aspect of the project, which might be necessary for certain complex or highly customized projects.

### **Conclusion**
Overall, forking an existing markdown-centric notepad project like Notable or Joplin can save you considerable time and effort compared to starting from scratch. This approach allows you to leverage existing work, focus on adding value where it matters most, and accelerate your project’s development.## Extracted Prompts
