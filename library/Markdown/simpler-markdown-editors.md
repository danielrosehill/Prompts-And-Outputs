# Prompt
My wife is interested in saving GPT outputs also. However, she is less interested in exploring advanced tech solutions than me. Nevertheless, she understands that markdown-native notepads are a great and logical fit for this use-case. Can you think of any markdown notepads that are simple and "beginner friendly". She uses Windows.

# Output
Certainly, I understand the importance of easy cloud synchronization for convenient access across devices. Let's focus on markdown editors that offer straightforward cloud storage integration for Windows users. Here are the best options that meet this criteria:

# Obsidian

Obsidian is a powerful markdown editor that combines simplicity with advanced features, making it suitable for both beginners and power users.

Key features:
- Clean, customizable interface
- Real-time preview
- Support for internal linking between notes
- Plugin system for extended functionality
- Local storage of files (which aids in cloud sync)

Cloud sync options:
1. Obsidian Sync (built-in, paid service)
2. iCloud (for Apple users)
3. Dropbox, Google Drive, or OneDrive (by storing the vault in the respective cloud folder)

Obsidian is free for personal use, with a paid sync service option.

2. Joplin: 
   - Open-source and free
   - Offers sync with Dropbox, OneDrive, NextCloud, and WebDAV
   - Simple interface with good organization features
   - Available on multiple platforms

3. VS Code with extensions:
   - While more tech-oriented, it can be set up for easy use
   - Use the "Settings Sync" feature to sync settings and extensions across devices
   - Store files in a cloud-synced folder (like Dropbox or OneDrive)
   - Extensible with many markdown-focused plugins

4. Typora (with some caveats):
   - While Typora doesn't have built-in sync, you can use it with cloud storage
   - Simply save and edit files directly in your cloud storage folder (e.g., Dropbox, OneDrive)
   - This method requires manual saving, but provides a simple sync solution

Among these options, Obsidian and Joplin stand out for their balance of user-friendliness and built-in sync options. Obsidian might be particularly appealing due to its clean interface and flexibility in sync options.

For your wife's use case of saving GPT outputs, here are some tips that work well with cloud-synced markdown editors:

1. Create a dedicated folder for GPT outputs within the cloud-synced directory.
2. Use a consistent file naming convention, e.g., "YYYY-MM-DD_Topic_GPTOutput.md".
3. Utilize the tagging system (if available in the chosen app) to categorize outputs.
4. Make use of markdown headers (# in markdown) to separate different outputs or sections within a file.
