The information provided is for demonstrative purposes only and is intended to highlight constraints and capabilities in LLM applications and prompt engineering strategies.*


# Prompt

Have a read through how I've used Obsidian to set up a vault for managing my LLM outputs into a systematic storage vault for aggregating the knowledge it generates. There are things that are great about Obsidian and those which are less great. It can be hugely complicated to make simple things function. I'm open to finding alternative tools for this system. The ability to sync with a cloud is important. I'm using Fedora Linux. And my smartphone is Android. Can you suggest any alternative ways to do this I mightn't have considered already?

# Output

Based on your description of using Obsidian to manage LLM outputs and create a knowledge vault, as well as your requirements for cloud sync, Linux compatibility, and Android support, here are some alternative approaches you might consider:

1. Logseq:
   - Open-source, privacy-focused knowledge management tool
   - Supports local storage and cloud sync (via GitHub)
   - Works on Linux, Android, and other platforms
   - Uses a graph-based structure similar to Obsidian
   - Supports plugins for extended functionality

2. Joplin:
   - Open-source note-taking and to-do application
   - End-to-end encryption for syncing across devices
   - Supports various cloud storage options (Dropbox, NextCloud, etc.)
   - Available on Linux and Android
   - Markdown support and plugin system

3. Standard Notes:
   - Encrypted note-taking app with emphasis on privacy
   - Cross-platform, including Linux and Android
   - Cloud sync with end-to-end encryption
   - Extensible with editors and themes

4. Notion:
   - All-in-one workspace for notes, databases, and collaboration
   - Web-based, with desktop and mobile apps available
   - Powerful organization and linking features
   - Supports cloud sync and offline access

5. Trilium Notes:
   - Hierarchical note-taking application with focus on building large personal knowledge bases
   - Self-hosted option available for privacy
   - Supports Linux and can be accessed via web browser on Android
   - Powerful scripting capabilities for automation

6. Zettlr:
   - Markdown editor designed for academic writing and note-taking
   - Open-source and available on Linux
   - Supports various cloud sync options
   - Can be used with mobile devices through synced folders

7. TiddlyWiki:
   - Unique non-linear notebook for capturing and organizing information
   - Single HTML file that can be used offline or synced to cloud storage
   - Highly customizable with plugins and themes
   - Can be accessed on any device with a web browser

When considering alternatives, keep in mind the following factors:

- Ease of migration from Obsidian (e.g., compatibility with Markdown files)
- Learning curve and complexity compared to Obsidian
- Specific features you rely on in your current setup
- Long-term sustainability and community support

Each of these options has its strengths and weaknesses, so you may want to experiment with a few to find the best fit for your workflow. Additionally, you might consider combining multiple tools if a single solution doesn't meet all your needs.
