For a minimalist, markdown-driven blog that’s easy on sensory input and allows for code syntax highlighting and images, here are some top options. Each of these setups supports writing locally and pushing to GitHub to publish updates automatically.

### 1. **Hugo with a Minimalist Theme**
   - **Overview**: Hugo is a static site generator that’s extremely fast, with native markdown support, built-in code syntax highlighting, and a strong theme library for minimalist designs.
   - **GitHub Workflow**: You can set up GitHub Pages or link it to a continuous deployment service (like Netlify) to publish automatically whenever you push to the repository.
   - **Recommended Themes**:
     - [**PaperMod**](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod): A highly customizable, minimalist theme with sensory-friendly layouts.
     - [**Cupper**](https://github.com/zwbetz-gh/cupper-hugo-theme): This theme is gentle on the eyes and built with accessibility in mind.
   - **Customization**: Customize themes by adjusting line height, font styles, and color schemes to create a calming, low-contrast layout.
   - **Getting Started**: Install Hugo, choose a theme, and link your GitHub repo with Netlify or GitHub Pages.

### 2. **Jekyll with a GitHub Pages Setup**
   - **Overview**: Jekyll integrates directly with GitHub Pages, making it straightforward for pushing markdown files to a GitHub repo and seeing them go live. Jekyll supports syntax highlighting, custom layouts, and image embeds with markdown.
   - **Themes for Sensory-Friendly Layouts**:
     - [**Minimal Mistakes**](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/): A popular, highly customizable theme with a focus on simplicity and accessibility.
     - [**So Simple**](https://github.com/mmistakes/so-simple-theme): As the name suggests, this is a very stripped-back, low-stimulation theme that prioritizes readability.
   - **Features**: Jekyll supports plugins for code highlighting, tags, categories, and image optimization.
   - **Deployment**: Push directly to GitHub Pages for automatic deployment, making it especially convenient.

### 3. **Zola with Sensory-Friendly Themes**
   - **Overview**: Zola is a Rust-based static site generator, similar to Hugo, with straightforward markdown support, built-in syntax highlighting, and easy deployment options.
   - **Themes**:
     - [**Even**](https://github.com/getzola/even): A minimal and visually soft theme, well-suited for sensory-friendly reading.
     - [**Cobalt**](https://github.com/getzola/cobalt): Simple with clean lines, ideal for quiet reading without visual clutter.
   - **GitHub Integration**: Zola works seamlessly with Netlify or other continuous deployment services to automate publishing on each push.
   - **Extras**: Zola has accessible default settings and can handle images and syntax highlighting well.

### 4. **Eleventy with a Minimal Theme**
   - **Overview**: Eleventy is flexible and allows complete control over the layout, making it easy to create or modify minimalist themes that are low in stimulation.
   - **Theme Options**:
     - [**Eleventy Base Blog**](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog): This theme offers a no-frills, clean layout suitable for long-form writing.
     - [**Minimal**](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-example-minimal): Extremely stripped-down and ideal if you want to prioritize sensory-friendly design elements.
   - **Features**: Markdown-based content, code syntax highlighting, and easy deployment with GitHub Pages or Netlify.
   - **Deployment**: Eleventy works well with GitHub Actions for automatic deployment on push, or with Netlify for a continuous deployment pipeline.

### Summary
**Hugo** and **Jekyll** are the most popular choices for ease of use, theme variety, and GitHub integration. For sensory-friendly layouts, themes like *PaperMod* on Hugo or *Minimal Mistakes* on Jekyll offer a balance of minimalist design with the functionality you need for writing, code snippets, and image support.
