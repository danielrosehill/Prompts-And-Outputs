# Prompt

I want to paste things out of Obsidian and into a web browser. But when I copy text out of Obsidian, it has the markdown tags intact. Is there a way to change this so that I can copy text without the markdown markings?

# Output

Yes, there are ways to **copy text from Obsidian** without the **Markdown formatting** so that you can paste plain, formatted text directly into a web browser or any other application without the Markdown tags. Here are some effective approaches:

### **1. Use the Obsidian WYSIWYG Mode (Live Preview)**
- **Live Preview Mode**:
  - **Obsidian** has a feature called **Live Preview**, which essentially provides a **WYSIWYG editing experience**. In Live Preview, Markdown tags are hidden, and the formatting is visually rendered (e.g., bold text, headers, etc.).
  - When copying text in **Live Preview**, it typically copies without including Markdown tags.
- **How to Enable**:
  - Click on the **three dots (options menu)** in the top right corner of your note.
  - Select **“Switch to Live Preview”**. This enables the mode where Markdown is visually formatted.
  - When you copy text from here, it should retain the formatting and omit the Markdown syntax.

### **2. Use the “Copy Markdown as HTML” Plugin**
If Live Preview isn’t quite giving you the flexibility you want, you can install a community plugin:

- **Install the Plugin**:
  - Go to **Settings** > **Community Plugins** > **Browse**.
  - Search for **“Markdown to HTML”** or **“Copy HTML”** and install the plugin that allows copying Markdown-formatted text as HTML.
  
- **How to Use**:
  - With the plugin enabled, right-click on the text or use the hotkey the plugin provides.
  - You can then copy the text as **HTML**, and when pasted into a web browser, it will appear formatted without the Markdown tags.

### **3. Use Obsidian’s “Copy as HTML” Command (Built-in Command)**
- **Copy as HTML**:
  - Obsidian also has a built-in command called **“Copy as HTML”** that allows you to copy the contents as HTML without the Markdown tags.
  - **How to Use**:
    - Use **Cmd/Ctrl + P** to open the **Command Palette**.
    - Search for **“Copy as HTML”**.
    - Select it, and the text will be copied without Markdown tags, allowing you to paste it into web browsers or other applications that support rich text or HTML.

### **4. Third-Party Clipboard Manager (System Level)**
You can use a **third-party clipboard manager** that can strip away formatting from copied content:

- **Windows**: Tools like **ClipClip** or **Ditto** let you strip formatting from any copied content.
- **Linux**: **Clipman** or **CopyQ** are popular clipboard managers that can be configured to automatically remove formatting or Markdown syntax.
- **Mac**: Use **Paste** or **Flycut**—both of which offer features to copy without formatting.

### **5. Use Pandoc to Convert Markdown to Plain Text**
If you’re doing this frequently or want to process longer documents:

- **Pandoc** is a command-line tool that can convert Markdown to **plain text** or **HTML**.
- You could create a **script** that takes the Markdown content from Obsidian and automatically converts it to formatted text.

Example command:
```bash
pandoc input.md -t plain -o output.txt
```
This command converts your Markdown file to plain text, stripping all the Markdown tags.

### **Summary**
- **Live Preview Mode**: Copy from **Live Preview** to get formatted text without Markdown tags.
- **Community Plugins**: Install plugins like **Markdown to HTML** for advanced copying options.
- **Built-in Command**: Use the **“Copy as HTML”** command from the Command Palette for rich-text-compatible copying.
- **Clipboard Manager**: Use a **clipboard manager** to remove formatting automatically.
- **Pandoc**: For advanced users, **Pandoc** can batch convert Markdown files into plain text or HTML.

Using these methods should make copying formatted text out of **Obsidian** without the Markdown tags more efficient, depending on your workflow and needs. Let me know if you need help with setting up any of these!
