The system you prefer is commonly called **"WYSIWYM" (What You See Is What You Mean)** editing or **"Live Preview"** in markdown editors.

- **WYSIWYM (What You See Is What You Mean)**: This approach combines markdown syntax input with real-time rich text rendering in a single pane, so you see the formatted content instantly as you write or paste markdown. Unlike WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get), where formatting options are chosen from a toolbar, WYSIWYM lets you write in markdown directly, with the syntax automatically converting to rich text as you type.

- **Live Preview**: This term often refers to editors that support WYSIWYM functionality, where the preview updates immediately in the same pane, displaying rich text without the need for a separate preview panel.

Obsidian, Typora, and some configurations in other editors use this approach to allow seamless markdown drafting and editing within a single-pane, rich text experience.
