# Prompt

I'm currently storing my prompts and outputs in an Obsidian folder as markdown files. Let's say that I want to migrate that data into Mongo DB. I'll want to store them as markdown to retain the formatting. And I'll also want to create links between the two collections just as I'm doing in Obsidian. For example, a prompt and an output are connected and that should be noted in both documents. Can you give me some guidance on how I can set this up? Please use a fictitious prompt and output if it would help to illlustrate an example.

# Output

Certainly! I'd be happy to guide you through setting up a MongoDB structure for your prompts and outputs, maintaining their markdown format and creating links between them. Let's use a fictitious example to illustrate this approach.

First, let's define our MongoDB collections:

1. `prompts` collection
2. `outputs` collection

Here's how we could structure these collections:

1. Prompts Collection:

```javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId("5f9a2b3c4d5e6f7a8b9c0d1e"),
  title: "Explain quantum computing",
  content: "# Explain quantum computing\n\nProvide a brief explanation of quantum computing, including:\n\n- Basic principles\n- Key differences from classical computing\n- Potential applications",
  createdAt: ISODate("2024-09-29T10:00:00Z"),
  updatedAt: ISODate("2024-09-29T10:00:00Z"),
  relatedOutputs: [ObjectId("5f9a2b3c4d5e6f7a8b9c0d2f")]
}
```

2. Outputs Collection:

```javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId("5f9a2b3c4d5e6f7a8b9c0d2f"),
  promptId: ObjectId("5f9a2b3c4d5e6f7a8b9c0d1e"),
  content: "# Quantum Computing Explained\n\nQuantum computing is a revolutionary approach to computation that leverages the principles of quantum mechanics. Here's a brief overview:\n\n## Basic Principles\n- Quantum bits (qubits) instead of classical bits\n- Superposition allows qubits to be in multiple states simultaneously\n- Entanglement enables qubits to be correlated with each other\n\n## Key Differences from Classical Computing\n- Exponential increase in processing power for certain problems\n- Probabilistic nature of quantum algorithms\n- Requires extremely low temperatures and specialized hardware\n\n## Potential Applications\n- Cryptography and secure communications\n- Drug discovery and molecular modeling\n- Optimization problems in finance and logistics\n- Machine learning and artificial intelligence",
  createdAt: ISODate("2024-09-29T10:05:00Z"),
  updatedAt: ISODate("2024-09-29T10:05:00Z")
}
```

In this structure:

1. We store the markdown content directly in the `content` field for both prompts and outputs.
2. We create a link between prompts and outputs using the `relatedOutputs` array in the prompts collection and the `promptId` field in the outputs collection.
3. We use `ObjectId` to create unique identifiers for each document.
4. We include `createdAt` and `updatedAt` fields to track when documents are created and modified.

To set this up in MongoDB, you could use the following steps:

1. Create the collections:

```javascript
db.createCollection("prompts")
db.createCollection("outputs")
```

2. Insert a prompt:

```javascript
db.prompts.insertOne({
  title: "Explain quantum computing",
  content: "# Explain quantum computing\n\nProvide a brief explanation of quantum computing, including:\n\n- Basic principles\n- Key differences from classical computing\n- Potential applications",
  createdAt: new Date(),
  updatedAt: new Date(),
  relatedOutputs: []
})
```

3. Insert an output and update the prompt:

```javascript
// Insert the output
let outputId = db.outputs.insertOne({
  promptId: promptId, // This should be the ObjectId of the prompt you just inserted
  content: "# Quantum Computing Explained\n\nQuantum computing is a revolutionary approach to computation that leverages the principles of quantum mechanics. Here's a brief overview:\n\n## Basic Principles\n- Quantum bits (qubits) instead of classical bits\n- Superposition allows qubits to be in multiple states simultaneously\n- Entanglement enables qubits to be correlated with each other\n\n## Key Differences from Classical Computing\n- Exponential increase in processing power for certain problems\n- Probabilistic nature of quantum algorithms\n- Requires extremely low temperatures and specialized hardware\n\n## Potential Applications\n- Cryptography and secure communications\n- Drug discovery and molecular modeling\n- Optimization problems in finance and logistics\n- Machine learning and artificial intelligence",
  createdAt: new Date(),
  updatedAt: new Date()
}).insertedId;

// Update the prompt with the new output
db.prompts.updateOne(
  { _id: promptId },
  { $push: { relatedOutputs: outputId } }
)
```

This structure allows you to:

1. Maintain the markdown formatting of your prompts and outputs.
2. Create bidirectional links between prompts and outputs.
3. Easily query related documents (e.g., find all outputs for a given prompt).

When migrating your existing data from Obsidian, you'd need to write a script that:

1. Reads your markdown files from the Obsidian vault.
2. Parses the content and extracts any metadata (like titles or tags).
3. Identifies the relationships between prompts and outputs.
4. Inserts the data into MongoDB using the structure outlined above.

Remember to create appropriate indexes on your collections to optimize query performance, especially on fields you'll frequently use for lookups (like `promptId` in the outputs collection).
