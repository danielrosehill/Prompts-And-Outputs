Yes, you can use only Markdown for your documentation on GitHub Pages. GitHub Pages supports rendering Markdown files directly into HTML, allowing you to create documentation using `.md` files without needing HTML. Just ensure your `index.md` file serves as the main entry point. 

You can structure it as follows:

```
my-docs-repo/
│
├── index.md              # Main entry point
├── guide1.md             # Additional guides
├── guide2.md
└── images/               # Directory for images used in documentation
    └── example.png
```

This structure will effectively enable you to publish documentation using solely Markdown.
