# Prompt

Perhaps we can look at a simpler model for the time being that might make it easier to actually read and retrieve these documents. Perhaps something like Postgres makes the most sense. If I wanted to create some kind of pipeline for pushing these same folders into a Postgres ... can you suggest one?

# Output

Using **PostgreSQL** to store your markdown repository is an excellent choice if you're aiming for a more straightforward way to **read** and **retrieve** documents without the overhead of specialized databases. Here's how you could go about creating a **pipeline** to push these four folders from Obsidian into a PostgreSQL database.

### **Pipeline Overview**
The goal is to set up a simple and effective pipeline that allows you to extract markdown data from your folders, transform it into a structured format, and load it into **PostgreSQL**. This approach follows an **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** workflow. Below, I outline how you could implement this pipeline using **Python** and **PostgreSQL**.

#### **Step 1: Set Up PostgreSQL Database**
First, set up your **PostgreSQL** database with appropriate tables to store the data from each of the four folders.

1. **Database Schema**
   - You need to create four tables, each corresponding to a folder in your Obsidian notebook:
     - `context_snippets`
     - `agent_configurations`
     - `prompts`
     - `outputs`

   Here's a suggested schema:

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE context_snippets (
       id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
       title VARCHAR(255),
       body TEXT,
       tags VARCHAR(255),
       created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
   );

   CREATE TABLE agent_configurations (
       id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
       agent_name VARCHAR(255),
       configuration JSONB,
       created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
   );

   CREATE TABLE prompts (
       id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
       title VARCHAR(255),
       content TEXT,
       prompt_type VARCHAR(50),  -- 'engineered' or 'extracted'
       tags VARCHAR(255),
       created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
   );

   CREATE TABLE outputs (
       id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
       title VARCHAR(255),
       body TEXT,
       related_prompt VARCHAR(255),
       tags VARCHAR(255),
       created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
   );
   ```

   - The schema can be adapted based on the actual metadata you want to store for each document type.

### **Step 2: Extract and Transform Data from Markdown Files**
To extract and transform your markdown files, you can use **Python** along with the **markdown-it-py** library or **Mistune** to parse the files.

1. **Python Script for Extraction and Transformation**:
   - Write a script to iterate through your markdown files, extract content, and transform it into a structure suitable for PostgreSQL.

   ```python
   import os
   import markdown_it
   import psycopg2
   from psycopg2 import sql
   from datetime import datetime

   # Initialize markdown parser
   md_parser = markdown_it.MarkdownIt()

   # Database connection settings
   conn = psycopg2.connect(
       dbname="your_database_name",
       user="your_username",
       password="your_password",
       host="localhost",
       port="5432"
   )
   cursor = conn.cursor()

   # Folder paths
   folders = {
       "context": "/path/to/context_snippets",
       "agents": "/path/to/agent_configurations",
       "prompts": "/path/to/prompts",
       "outputs": "/path/to/outputs"
   }

   def parse_markdown_file(filepath):
       with open(filepath, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
           content = file.read()
           html_content = md_parser.render(content)
           return content, html_content

   # Extract, Transform, and Load data for each folder
   for folder_name, folder_path in folders.items():
       for filename in os.listdir(folder_path):
           if filename.endswith(".md"):
               file_path = os.path.join(folder_path, filename)
               content, _ = parse_markdown_file(file_path)

               # Extract metadata if needed (e.g., title, tags)
               title = filename.replace(".md", "")
               created_at = datetime.now()

               if folder_name == "context":
                   cursor.execute(
                       "INSERT INTO context_snippets (title, body, created_at) VALUES (%s, %s, %s)",
                       (title, content, created_at)
                   )
               elif folder_name == "agents":
                   # Assume JSON is directly stored in the markdown
                   cursor.execute(
                       "INSERT INTO agent_configurations (agent_name, configuration, created_at) VALUES (%s, %s, %s)",
                       (title, content, created_at)
                   )
               elif folder_name == "prompts":
                   prompt_type = "engineered" if "engineered" in filename else "extracted"
                   cursor.execute(
                       "INSERT INTO prompts (title, content, prompt_type, created_at) VALUES (%s, %s, %s, %s)",
                       (title, content, prompt_type, created_at)
                   )
               elif folder_name == "outputs":
                   cursor.execute(
                       "INSERT INTO outputs (title, body, created_at) VALUES (%s, %s, %s)",
                       (title, content, created_at)
                   )

   # Commit changes and close connection
   conn.commit()
   cursor.close()
   conn.close()
   ```

   - **Extract**: The script reads the markdown files.
   - **Transform**: You could parse and modify the content if needed (e.g., converting to HTML, extracting metadata).
   - **Load**: Insert the parsed content into the respective PostgreSQL tables.

### **Step 3: Automate the Pipeline**
Once the ETL script is ready, you can automate it using the following approaches:

1. **Cron Job**:
   - Schedule a **cron job** on Linux (including Fedora) to run the ETL script at regular intervals (e.g., every night) to keep the database updated.
   - Example cron job:
     ```sh
     0 2 * * * /usr/bin/python3 /path/to/etl_script.py
     ```
   - This runs the script every day at 2 AM.

2. **Git Integration**:
   - If your markdown repository is in a **Git** repo (e.g., on GitHub), you could use **Git hooks** to trigger the ETL process every time there is a push.
   - Alternatively, use **GitHub Actions** to run the script whenever changes are pushed to the repository.

### **Step 4: Accessing Data via Android**
For easy access to the data from an Android device, you can build a simple API:

1. **Create a RESTful API**:
   - Use **Flask** (Python) or **Express.js** (Node.js) to create a backend API that interacts with your PostgreSQL database.
   - This API can allow you to:
     - Search for documents by title or content.
     - Retrieve prompts, agents, context snippets, or outputs as needed.
  
   Example using Flask:
   ```python
   from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
   import psycopg2

   app = Flask(__name__)

   conn = psycopg2.connect(
       dbname="your_database_name",
       user="your_username",
       password="your_password",
       host="localhost",
       port="5432"
   )
   cursor = conn.cursor()

   @app.route('/documents/<folder>', methods=['GET'])
   def get_documents(folder):
       cursor.execute(sql.SQL("SELECT * FROM {}").format(sql.Identifier(folder)))
       results = cursor.fetchall()
       return jsonify(results)

   if __name__ == '__main__':
       app.run(debug=True)
   ```

2. **Mobile Integration**:
   - Use **Retrofit** to create a client for accessing the API from your Android app.
   - You can build an interface on Android that allows you to **search**, **filter**, and **view** documents from each folder.

### **Summary**:
1. **Set Up PostgreSQL Database**: Define tables to store each type of document separately (context snippets, agent configurations, prompts, outputs).
2. **ETL Pipeline**:
   - **Extract** content from markdown files using a Python script.
   - **Transform** data as needed (extract metadata).
   - **Load** data into PostgreSQL using **psycopg2**.
3. **Automate**: Set up a **cron job** or **Git hooks** to keep the database updated.
4. **Access via Android**: Build a **Flask-based REST API** to interact with the database and use **Retrofit** to connect to the API from an Android app.

This setup will allow you to easily manage, read, and retrieve documents from your markdown repository, while also being flexible enough to grow in complexity when needed. Let me know if you'd like more specific help on any part of this implementation!
