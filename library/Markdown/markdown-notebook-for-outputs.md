# Prompt

How difficult would it be to create my own markdown notebook specifically for my purpose of storing GPT Outputs? Lets say that it consisted of a simple UI for capturing prompts and outputs. Could I create my own YAML front matter templates for automatically capturing the bidreictional links between the two elements?

# Outputs

Creating your own Markdown notebook specifically tailored for storing GPT outputs is definitely feasible and can be accomplished with varying levels of complexity depending on the features you want to include. Here’s a breakdown of what it would involve:

### 1. **Basic Setup**:
   - **Markdown Files**: Each conversation (or session) could be stored as a Markdown file.
   - **YAML Front Matter**: This can be used to store metadata such as the prompt, output, date, and bidirectional links between elements.

### 2. **YAML Front Matter for Bidirectional Links**:
   - **Structure**: You can define a template for your Markdown files using YAML front matter. For instance:

   ```yaml
   ---
   title: "Conversation with GPT on {{ date }}"
   date: "{{ date }}"
   prompt_id: "{{ unique_prompt_id }}"
   output_id: "{{ unique_output_id }}"
   related_prompts: ["prompt_id_1", "prompt_id_2"]
   related_outputs: ["output_id_1", "output_id_2"]
   ---
   ```

   - **Bidirectional Links**: The `related_prompts` and `related_outputs` fields could automatically populate links to related conversations, enabling easy navigation between them.

### 3. **Simple UI for Capturing Prompts and Outputs**:
   - **Frontend Framework**: You could use a simple frontend framework like React or Vue.js to create a basic UI for inputting prompts and outputs.
   - **Form Fields**: The UI could consist of text fields for entering the prompt and output, along with any relevant metadata.
   - **YAML Generation**: When the user submits the form, the data could be automatically saved in a Markdown file with the appropriate YAML front matter.

### 4. **Automation of YAML Front Matter**:
   - **Templates**: You could pre-define templates that automatically generate the YAML front matter based on user input. For example, using JavaScript or Python to handle the dynamic parts (like `date`, `prompt_id`, etc.).
   - **ID Generation**: Use a simple UUID generator for unique IDs for prompts and outputs to ensure they can be referenced easily.

### 5. **Bidirectional Linking**:
   - **Manual Links**: You can manually add links in the YAML front matter to related prompts and outputs.
   - **Automated Links**: To automate this, you could create a script that updates the related prompts and outputs based on the content of the Markdown files.

### 6. **Storage**:
   - **File Structure**: Organize your files in a directory structure that makes sense for your workflow, e.g., by date, topic, or project.
   - **Version Control**: Consider using Git to version control your Markdown files, making it easier to track changes and collaborate.

### 7. **Advanced Features**:
   - **Tagging and Categorization**: Add tags in the YAML front matter to categorize prompts and outputs, which could be useful for searching and filtering.
   - **Search Functionality**: Implement a search tool within your UI to quickly find specific prompts or outputs based on tags, dates, or content.
   - **Graph Visualization**: If you want to visualize the relationships between prompts and outputs, you could use a graph database (like Neo4j) or a visualization library (like D3.js) to represent the links.

### 8. **Implementation Considerations**:
   - **Development Complexity**: A basic version with static Markdown files and YAML front matter can be relatively simple, especially if you’re comfortable with Markdown and front-end development.
   - **Flexibility**: This approach gives you a lot of flexibility, allowing you to customize your notebook as your needs evolve.
   - **Learning Curve**: If you’re new to these technologies, there might be a learning curve, particularly with front-end development and scripting for automation.

### **Implementation Example in Python**:
Here’s a simple example of how you might generate a Markdown file with YAML front matter in Python:

```python
import uuid
from datetime import datetime

# Data to be stored
prompt = "What is the capital of France?"
output = "The capital of France is Paris."

# Generate unique IDs
prompt_id = str(uuid.uuid4())
output_id = str(uuid.uuid4())
date = datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")

# YAML front matter template
yaml_front_matter = f"""---
title: "Conversation on {date}"
date: "{date}"
prompt_id: "{prompt_id}"
output_id: "{output_id}"
related_prompts: []
related_outputs: []
---
"""

# Markdown content
markdown_content = f"{yaml_front_matter}\n# Prompt\n{prompt}\n\n# Output\n{output}"

# Save to a markdown file
filename = f"conversation_{prompt_id}.md"
with open(filename, 'w') as file:
    file.write(markdown_content)

print(f"Markdown file {filename} created.")
```

### **Summary**:
Building your own Markdown notebook for storing GPT outputs with a custom UI and YAML front matter is quite feasible. This setup allows for a highly flexible and personalized system that can evolve as your needs grow. It’s also relatively low-cost in terms of setup since it primarily relies on lightweight technologies like Markdown, YAML, and simple scripting or web frameworks.## Extracted Prompts
