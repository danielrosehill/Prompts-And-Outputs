*Note: this repository consists of the outputs of large language models (LLMs). In many cases, these are unedited or minimally edited. The information provided is for demonstrative purposes only and is intended to highlight constraints and capabilities in LLM applications and prompt engineering strategies.*


# Prompt
It seems like we're hitting upon the same few tools all the time. Maybe that's a good sign. A key requirement as I explained yesterday is that I need to be able to quickly capture LLM outputs which come as markdown. In Obsidian I just paste these and the formatting is automatically detected. What is this functionality called so that I can make sure to look for it when evaluating options?

# Output
The functionality you're describing is typically referred to as **"Markdown Auto-Parsing"** or **"Automatic Markdown Rendering"**. This feature allows pasted text to be instantly recognized and formatted according to markdown syntax, making it especially convenient for quickly capturing structured outputs.

When evaluating tools, here are some terms to look out for to ensure they have this capability:

1. **Markdown Auto-Parsing / Auto-Detection**: Indicates that the software automatically recognizes markdown text upon pasting and applies the correct formatting without additional input.

2. **Live Markdown Preview**: This term is often used when markdown content is immediately formatted visually (rendered) while you write or paste it, similar to Obsidian.

3. **WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) Markdown Editor**: Some tools offer a markdown WYSIWYG interface that renders markdown as you type or paste, giving you an easy way to see the final formatting immediately.

4. **Automatic Formatting for Markdown**: Tools might describe this as "auto-apply markdown styling," indicating that pasted markdown content will be rendered immediately.

5. **Real-Time Markdown Rendering**: This feature makes sure that markdown is rendered in real time as you paste, without needing to switch views or hit a render button.

When evaluating tools for capturing LLM outputs, ensure that they mention **markdown auto-detection** or a **real-time preview** of markdown formatting in their feature descriptions. This will help you maintain the same convenient workflow you're used to in Obsidian. Let me know if you'd like more help in finding tools with this specific functionality!

# What is typing in markdown called?

In Obsidian I can type in markdown and that will immediately render. So this is the WYSIWYG markdown editing feautre?

# Output

Yes, exactly! The feature you're referring to in Obsidian is called **WYSIWYG Markdown Editing**, also often labeled as **Live Preview**.

- **WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) Markdown Editor** means that, as you type in markdown syntax (e.g., `**bold**`, `# Heading`, etc.), it **immediately renders** the formatted text in place, without needing to switch views or preview modes.
  
- **Live Preview** is another term Obsidian uses to describe this functionality. It allows you to see the final formatting while you're typing, without the need for a separate preview pane.

This feature makes it easy to capture and format notes in markdown with instant feedback, and it's especially helpful for organizing LLM outputs, as you can directly see the structured text as intended. When evaluating other tools, looking for **WYSIWYG markdown** or **Live Markdown Preview** will help you identify ones with similar functionality to Obsidian.
