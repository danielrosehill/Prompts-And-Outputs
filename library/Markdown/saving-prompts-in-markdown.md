# Prompt
is it possible to save the prompt as markdown? can the script read from that?

# Output
Yes, it's definitely possible to save the prompt as a markdown file and have the script read from that. This is a great way to separate the content from the code and make it easier to modify prompts without changing the script. Here's how you can modify the script to accomplish this:

1. First, save your prompt as a markdown file, let's call it "prompt.md". The content would look something like this:

```markdown
# Prompt Specifications

Create a Python GUI application with the following specifications:

## Layout
- Three text input sections labeled "Title", "Prompt", and "Output"
- A button to change the save path
- A button to save the entered text

## Functionality
- Save entered text as a markdown file
- Use the "Title" input to generate the filename (e.g., "Title" becomes "title.md")
- Replace spaces in the filename with underscores
- Format the saved file content as:
  ```
  # Prompt
  [prompttext]
  
  # Output
  [outputtext]
  ```
- Allow users to configure and save the output folder path
- Clear all input fields after saving

## File handling
- Save the formatted text to the specified output folder
- Convert the saved file to markdown format

## User interaction
- Implement a "Save" button to trigger the saving process
- Provide a button to change the save path

## Additional requirements
- Name the Python script "program.py"
- Save the script in the current directory
```

2. Now, you can modify your Python script to read from this markdown file. Here's an example of how you can do this:

```python
import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import filedialog
import os
import markdown

def read_prompt_from_markdown(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        md_content = file.read()
    html_content = markdown.markdown(md_content)
    return html_content

# Read the prompt from the markdown file
prompt_html = read_prompt_from_markdown('prompt.md')

# Create the main window
root = tk.Tk()
root.title("Vault Output Saver")

# Create and pack a label to display the prompt
prompt_label = tk.Label(root, text="Prompt:", justify=tk.LEFT)
prompt_label.pack()

# Create and pack a text widget to display the HTML content
prompt_text = tk.Text(root, height=10, width=50)
prompt_text.pack()
prompt_text.insert(tk.END, prompt_html)

# Rest of your GUI code here...

root.mainloop()
```

This script does the following:

1. It imports the necessary libraries, including the `markdown` library to convert markdown to HTML.

2. It defines a function `read_prompt_from_markdown` that reads a markdown file and converts its content to HTML.

3. It reads the prompt from 'prompt.md' and converts it to HTML.

4. It creates a simple GUI window with a label and a text widget to display the prompt.

You can then continue building your GUI application based on the specifications in the prompt. This approach allows you to easily modify the prompt by editing the markdown file, without needing to change the Python script itself.

Remember to install the `markdown` library if you haven't already:

```
pip install markdown
```

This approach provides a clean separation between your prompt content and your application code, making it easier to manage and update your prompts.
