# Prompt

No, there were two that I needed. One was that when you paste MD it should be automatically formatted into text that is readable (without the MD tags). The second was that you should be able to type in markdown and have that formatting automatically applied such that the text renders instanteneously in readable text. Both of these features are available in Obsidian. What's the description for them?

# Output

Ah, I see what you mean now. In Obsidian, these two features are:

1. **Automatic Formatting of Pasted Markdown**:
   - **Feature Name**: **Auto-Format on Paste**
   - **Description**: Automatically converts raw Markdown syntax when pasted into the editor into properly formatted text (e.g., `# Heading` is instantly displayed as a rendered heading without showing the Markdown tags).

2. **Real-Time Markdown Rendering**:
   - **Feature Name**: **Live Preview**
   - **Description**: As you type Markdown (e.g., `**bold**`, `# heading`), the formatting is applied instantly and the text renders in its final readable format without needing to switch between edit and preview modes.

These two features make working with Markdown smoother by handling both pasted and typed content in real-time for readability.
