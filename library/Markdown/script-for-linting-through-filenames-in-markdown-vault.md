# Prompt

Here's an archive of markdown notes that I currently have saved on my computer. I'm hoping to import them into a new tool. I would like to preserve the file names as much as possible because they are used in this system as titles. However, I'd like to remove anything in the filenames that might choke the import process. Can you suggest a script to lint through the names?
