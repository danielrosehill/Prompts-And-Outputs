# Prompt

One issue with the current workflow of syncing the notes via B2 is that it means that as the vault grows bigger it's also harder to manage locally. On a computer this isn't a big issue but smartphone hardware is much more constrained. Are there any markdown readers for Android that could stream the notes from B2. In other words, using it as a remote mounted volume (in read only mode) rather than as a sync?

# Output

To address your issue of managing a large **Obsidian vault** on a constrained device like a smartphone, it would be ideal to **stream notes directly** from **Backblaze B2** (or another remote storage) without syncing the entire vault to the phone. Unfortunately, there aren’t many markdown readers that natively support streaming from B2 or similar cloud storage as a **remote-mounted volume**. However, there are a few creative workarounds and tools that could achieve this functionality with some tweaking.

Here are a few approaches to stream markdown notes from B2 directly without syncing the entire vault locally:

### 1. **rclone with Cloud Mounting**
   **rclone** can be used to mount a B2 bucket as a **remote file system** on Android, allowing markdown readers to access files as if they were local without downloading everything.

   #### How it works:
   - **rclone mount**: Using **rclone mount**, you can mount your B2 vault to your Android device as a read-only filesystem, which will allow you to browse and access individual markdown files on demand rather than syncing the entire vault.
   - **Integration with Markdown Readers**: Once the B2 bucket is mounted as a filesystem, you can open and read the markdown files with your preferred markdown reader (like Markor or Epsilon Notes).
   
   #### Setup:
   - **Install rclone on Android**: You can use **Termux** (a terminal emulator for Android) to install and configure rclone.
   - **Mount B2 bucket**: Configure rclone to mount the B2 bucket as a read-only volume. You can follow rclone’s official guide on mounting a cloud bucket, and Termux will let you access this mounted volume.
   - **Markdown Reader**: Use any markdown reader (like Markor) to open and view the files as needed, directly from the remote volume.

   #### Pros:
   - Only downloads files when you access them, minimizing storage usage.
   - Direct streaming of markdown files without full synchronization.
   - Simple once configured.

   #### Cons:
   - Requires some setup with **rclone** and **Termux**.
   - May have performance limitations based on network speed and file access latency.

### 2. **Cloud Storage File Browsers with Markdown Support**
   Another approach is to use a **cloud file manager** that integrates with B2 and has built-in **markdown preview capabilities**.

   - **Solid Explorer** (with WebDAV or S3 plugin):
     - Solid Explorer has an **S3 plugin** that allows access to Backblaze B2 via the S3 API. Once configured, you can browse the vault stored on B2 and preview markdown files without syncing them locally.
     - Solid Explorer has built-in support for file previews (including markdown), allowing you to **stream** and read markdown files on demand without syncing.

   #### Setup:
   - Install **Solid Explorer** and the **S3 plugin** on your Android device.
   - Configure access to your B2 bucket using the **S3-compatible API**.
   - Browse your vault stored on B2 directly, and open markdown files using the markdown preview feature.

   #### Pros:
   - Simple interface for browsing and previewing remote files.
   - No need to sync files locally—files are streamed on demand.
   - Markdown preview is built into Solid Explorer.

   #### Cons:
   - Solid Explorer is a paid app (after a free trial).
   - May not have full markdown support with advanced formatting features like Obsidian.

### 3. **WebDAV Server for B2 + Markdown Reader**
   You can set up a **WebDAV server** that points to your B2 storage, and then use a markdown reader that supports opening files over WebDAV.

   #### How it works:
   - Use **rclone** to create a **WebDAV endpoint** for your B2 bucket.
   - On your Android device, use a markdown reader that can access WebDAV files directly.

   #### Tools:
   - **rclone WebDAV server**: You can use rclone to serve your B2 bucket over WebDAV, creating a URL that lets markdown readers on Android access the files directly.
   - **Markor or Epsilon Notes**: These markdown readers can open files over WebDAV if you configure them to point to your rclone WebDAV server.

   #### Setup:
   - **Set up rclone WebDAV**: Install rclone on your server or Android (via Termux) and configure it to serve your B2 bucket as a WebDAV endpoint.
   - **Access via Markdown Reader**: On your Android device, configure your markdown reader to open files over WebDAV, allowing you to browse and read files directly from B2.

   #### Pros:
   - Works without syncing files locally.
   - Direct file access over WebDAV.
   - Markdown readers with full navigation and preview functionality.

   #### Cons:
   - Requires rclone WebDAV setup.
   - Network speed may affect the performance.

### 4. **Custom Solution Using an Android Markdown Reader**
   If none of the above options suit your needs, a custom solution might involve building a lightweight app that can:
   - Directly access files from B2 via **Backblaze's API**.
   - Render markdown files in a simple UI with navigation buttons for pagination.

   **Tools for this approach**:
   - **Flutter** or **React Native**: You could quickly build a simple app that accesses B2 and streams markdown files directly.
   - **Markdown Rendering Libraries**: Both platforms have libraries for rendering markdown in a user-friendly way.

   #### Pros:
   - Fully customized solution tailored to your needs.
   - Full control over markdown rendering and navigation.
   - Streams files directly from B2 without full synchronization.

   #### Cons:
   - Requires some development effort.

### Conclusion
The best **stopgap solution** for streaming markdown files from B2 on Android would be to:
- **Mount B2 as a remote filesystem** using **rclone** and access the files with a markdown reader like **Markor** or **Epsilon Notes**.
- Alternatively, use **Solid Explorer** with its **S3 plugin** to directly browse and preview markdown files from your B2 bucket.

These approaches will allow you to keep your vault stored remotely, stream notes when needed, and avoid filling up local storage on your Android device.
