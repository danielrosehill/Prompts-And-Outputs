# Prompt

Let's work backwards. How many prompts and outputs (of equal number) could fit in 1TB of storage?

# Output

To calculate how many prompts and outputs (of equal number) could fit in 1TB of storage, we'll use the average size per prompt-output pair that we calculated earlier and work backwards. Let's break it down step by step:

1. Total storage available: 1TB = 1,000,000MB

2. Average size per prompt-output pair: 0.4803MB
   (This is the sum of 0.0053MB for output and 0.475KB ≈ 0.0004638671875MB for prompt)

3. Number of pairs that can fit in 1TB:
   1,000,000MB / 0.4803MB per pair ≈ 2,082,032.48 pairs

4. Since we need a whole number of pairs, we'll round down:
   2,082,032 prompt-output pairs

Therefore, in 1TB of storage, you could fit approximately:
- 2,082,032 prompts
- 2,082,032 outputs

This means a total of 4,164,064 individual items (prompts + outputs) could be stored in 1TB, assuming the average sizes remain consistent.

It's important to note that this is an estimate based on your current average sizes. In a real-world scenario, there might be some variation in sizes, and you'd also need to account for some overhead for the database structure, indexes, and potential future growth. It's generally good practice to leave some buffer space, so you might want to plan for slightly less than this maximum theoretical capacity.
