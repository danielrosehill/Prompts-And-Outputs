# Prompt

Can you suggest any tools which could be run either on Fedora or as Chrome apps. Either way their purpose would be to convert markdown on the clipboard and automatically reformat it so that it could be pasted into Google Docs (or a similar program) with the formatting applied instead of the markdown tags. Suggest some options for both?

# Output

Here are some options for tools that can convert markdown on the clipboard into formatted text suitable for pasting into Google Docs, compatible with Fedora and Chrome apps:

### Fedora Options:
1. **Pandoc**:
   - **Description**: A versatile document converter that can handle markdown and convert it to various formats, including HTML, which can be pasted into Google Docs with formatting.
   - **How it works**: You can create a script that automatically converts markdown from the clipboard into HTML.
   - **Installation**: Available in Fedora's package manager (`dnf install pandoc`).
   
2. **Typora**:
   - **Description**: A markdown editor that displays formatted text in real-time and can export to various formats, including HTML.
   - **How it works**: Write in markdown, then copy the formatted text directly from Typora to Google Docs.

These tools provide a range of options for converting markdown to a format suitable for pasting into Google Docs, with both local applications and browser-based solutions.

# What is this called?

What is the functionality that I'm looking for called? What format does text need to be in in order to be pasteable into a Google Doc with the formatting already set up? It's not plain text and it's not markdown

# Output

The functionality you're looking for is often referred to as **"rich text conversion"** or **"markdown-to-rich text transformation."** In the context of pasting text into programs like Google Docs, the text needs to be in a **rich text format (RTF)** or **HTML** format.

### Why not plain text or markdown?
- **Plain text**: Contains no formatting (just raw characters).
- **Markdown**: A lightweight markup language that still needs to be processed or converted into a formatted text representation.

### What format works?
- **Rich Text (RTF)**: Contains formatting like bold, italics, headers, etc., and can be directly pasted into word processors with formatting preserved.
- **HTML**: Also works well because Google Docs can interpret HTML to apply formatting (e.g., `<b>` for bold, `<i>` for italics). When you paste from HTML, it is converted into the appropriate document structure in Google Docs.
  
Thus, for pasting into Google Docs with the formatting already set up, the text should ideally be in **HTML** or **RTF** format.

Tools or extensions you use should be able to convert your markdown into one of these formats before it is copied to the clipboard for pasting.

# RTF vs HTML for conversion

I'm guessing RTF is more supported than HTML for auto conversion? Can RTF preserve the links?

# Output

Yes, **RTF (Rich Text Format)** is generally more widely supported for automatic conversion when pasting text into word processors like Google Docs, Microsoft Word, and others. It’s designed to handle basic formatting like bold, italics, headers, and lists across different platforms.

### Can RTF Preserve Links?
Yes, **RTF can preserve links** (hyperlinks) when properly formatted. Links in RTF documents can be embedded in a way that keeps both the visible text (the link text) and the underlying URL intact when pasted into a document like Google Docs. However, the link preservation in RTF can sometimes depend on the application that generates the RTF or the platform where it's pasted.

While RTF is widely supported, **HTML** is still often a more flexible option for preserving complex formatting, especially with modern web-based editors like Google Docs, which can fully interpret HTML, including links, images, and even more advanced styles.

### In Summary:
- **RTF** is more broadly supported and can preserve basic formatting, including links.
- **HTML** might offer better compatibility with complex web-based editors like Google Docs, particularly for more advanced formatting.
  
For automatic conversion and compatibility across tools, RTF is great, but for full web-style formatting and links, HTML may sometimes work better, especially in web-based word processors like Google Docs.
