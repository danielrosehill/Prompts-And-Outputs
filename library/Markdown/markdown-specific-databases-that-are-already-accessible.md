Prompt: "I would like to devise a system for storing prompt outputs in a file/knowledge management system which supports the following functionalities: the user fills out an input form with three fields: title, prompt, output. The form parses this information. The prompt is saved into a prompt library folder. The output is saved into a prompt output folder. And the title is used to name the file in the output folder. The output file includes a link to the prompt and vice versa. All these documents are created automatically after the user completes the form. I am open to self-hosting or using cloud technology so long as I can retain a backup of the data with the links preserved. Can you think of any technologies that might meet this need?"

Here's a list of databases that are optimized for storing Markdown files at scale and support metadata and interconnections. I've also noted whether there are applications for storing notes that natively support these databases:

### 1. **Markdown-based Database: **Zettlr**

   - **Metadata Support**: Yes, supports YAML front matter for metadata.
   - **Interconnections**: Supports backlinks and inter-note linking.
   - **Out-of-the-Box Application**: Zettlr itself is an application designed for managing Markdown files. It integrates well with Git for version control.

### 2. **Git-based Database: **Git/GitHub**
   - **Description**: Git, and platforms like GitHub, can be used as a database for storing Markdown files, leveraging Git's version control system to manage large repositories of Markdown content.
   - **Metadata Support**: Metadata can be stored in YAML front matter within Markdown files.
   - **Interconnections**: Links between files can be managed using standard Markdown linking and GitHub's built-in linking capabilities.
   - **Out-of-the-Box Application**: Tools like Obsidian, Typora, and Zettlr support Git for version control and can be used to manage Markdown files in a Git repository.

### 3. **NoSQL Database: **Couchbase**
   - **Description**: Couchbase is a NoSQL database optimized for high performance at scale, capable of storing Markdown files as JSON documents with rich metadata.
   - **Metadata Support**: Yes, extensive support for custom metadata fields.
   - **Interconnections**: Interconnections can be managed through custom fields and document relationships.
   - **Out-of-the-Box Application**: No direct out-of-the-box note-taking applications, but can be integrated with custom frontends or via API connections with note-taking tools that support external databases.

### 4. **Document-oriented Database: **MongoDB**
   - **Description**: MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that stores data in JSON-like documents, making it well-suited for storing Markdown files along with rich metadata.
   - **Metadata Support**: Yes, supports extensive metadata storage in JSON format.
   - **Interconnections**: Relationships between documents can be managed using MongoDB’s rich querying capabilities.
   - **Out-of-the-Box Application**: Tools like Joplin support MongoDB indirectly through plugins or custom setups but might require additional configuration.

### 5. **Search and Indexing Database: **Elasticsearch**
   - **Description**: Elasticsearch is a distributed search engine optimized for indexing and searching large datasets, including Markdown files with metadata.
   - **Metadata Support**: Yes, supports custom metadata fields and rich queries.
   - **Interconnections**: Supports interconnections through indexing and link analysis within stored documents.
   - **Out-of-the-Box Application**: No direct support from typical note-taking apps, but tools like Logseq can be configured to index Markdown files in Elasticsearch for advanced search capabilities.

### 6. **Graph Database: **Neo4j**
   - **Description**: Neo4j is a graph database designed for managing highly interconnected data, making it ideal for storing Markdown files with complex interrelationships.
   - **Metadata Support**: Yes, supports metadata as properties on nodes and relationships.
   - **Interconnections**: Built specifically for managing and querying relationships between documents.
   - **Out-of-the-Box Application**: Neo4j isn’t natively supported by note-taking apps, but custom integrations can be created using Neo4j’s APIs to link note content with graph-based queries.

### 7. **Hierarchical Database: **Dendron**
   - **Description**: Dendron is a hierarchical note-taking tool designed to manage large Markdown repositories with extensive support for metadata and backlinks.
   - **Metadata Support**: Yes, supports YAML front matter and hierarchical note structures.
   - **Interconnections**: Strong support for inter-note linking and backlinks.
   - **Out-of-the-Box Application**: Dendron itself is the application and database, optimized for this purpose.

### 8. **Content Management System: **Wiki.js**
   - **Description**: Wiki.js is an open-source wiki engine that can manage large amounts of Markdown content, supporting metadata and interconnections.
   - **Metadata Support**: Yes, supports custom metadata fields and tags.
   - **Interconnections**: Strong support for inter-page linking and backlinks.
   - **Out-of-the-Box Application**: Wiki.js itself is designed to manage Markdown files and supports these features natively.

### 9. **Key-Value Store: **Redis with RedisJSON**
   - **Description**: Redis is a high-performance key-value store, and with RedisJSON, it can store JSON documents that include Markdown content and metadata.
   - **Metadata Support**: Yes, using RedisJSON for storing structured metadata.
   - **Interconnections**: Limited out-of-the-box but can be managed through custom implementations.
   - **Out-of-the-Box Application**: No direct note-taking applications, but Redis can be used as a backend database for custom note-taking tools.

### 10. **Static Site Generator: **Hugo with a Headless CMS (e.g., Netlify CMS)**
   - **Description**: Hugo is a static site generator that stores content in Markdown files, often managed through a headless CMS like Netlify CMS, which supports metadata and interconnections.
   - **Metadata Support**: Yes, supports YAML front matter and extensive metadata.
   - **Interconnections**: Managed through custom front matter fields and linking within the Markdown files.
   - **Out-of-the-Box Application**: Hugo combined with a CMS like Netlify CMS or Forestry provides a full solution for managing Markdown content with metadata and interconnections.

### 11. **TiddlyWiki**
   - **Description**: TiddlyWiki is a non-linear, self-contained personal wiki that stores content as Markdown or WikiText, optimized for rich interconnections and metadata.
   - **Metadata Support**: Yes, supports custom fields and metadata tags.
   - **Interconnections**: Built for strong interconnections, including backlinks and dynamic links between notes.
   - **Out-of-the-Box Application**: TiddlyWiki itself is both the application and the storage system, optimized for managing interconnected Markdown notes.

### 12. **Document Store Database: **CouchDB**
   - **Description**: Apache CouchDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database that stores data as JSON documents, suitable for storing Markdown content with associated metadata.
   - **Metadata Support**: Yes, supports storing extensive metadata alongside content.
   - **Interconnections**: Interconnections can be managed through relationships within documents and queries.

These databases are designed to handle large-scale storage of Markdown files while also supporting metadata and the creation of interconnections between documents. While some are more natively supported by existing note-taking applications, others may require custom integrations to fully realize their potential in managing a large Markdown repository.
