Yes, you can use a simple shell script to convert all Markdown file names in a folder to kebab case. Here's how you can do it:

### Script: Convert to Kebab Case

1. **Create a Shell Script**:
   Save the following script as `convert-to-kebab.sh`:

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash

   # Function to convert string to kebab case
   to_kebab_case() {
       echo "$1" | sed -E 's/([a-z])([A-Z])/\1-\2/g' | tr ' ' '-' | tr '_' '-' | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'
   }

   # Directory containing your Markdown files
   DIRECTORY="${1:-.}"

   # Process each .md file in the directory (and subdirectories)
   find "$DIRECTORY" -type f -name "*.md" | while read -r file; do
       # Get the directory and filename
       dir=$(dirname "$file")
       filename=$(basename "$file")
       
       # Convert the filename to kebab case
       kebab_case=$(to_kebab_case "$filename")
       
       # Rename the file only if the name has changed
       if [[ "$filename" != "$kebab_case" ]]; then
           mv "$file" "$dir/$kebab_case"
           echo "Renamed: $file -> $dir/$kebab_case"
       fi
   done
   ```

2. **Make the Script Executable**:
   Open a terminal and run:
   ```bash
   chmod +x convert-to-kebab.sh
   ```

3. **Run the Script**:
   You can run the script by specifying the directory containing your Markdown files. For example:
   ```bash
   ./convert-to-kebab.sh /path/to/markdown/files
   ```

   If you want to run it on the current directory, just use:
   ```bash
   ./convert-to-kebab.sh
   ```

### Explanation of the Script:
- The `to_kebab_case` function converts CamelCase, spaces, and underscores to kebab case.
- It uses `find` to locate all `.md` files, including those in subdirectories.
- Files are renamed only if their names change after conversion to avoid unnecessary operations.
- The script handles spaces, underscores, and uppercase letters effectively.

**Note**: It's a good idea to back up your files before running the script, just in case any renaming doesnâ€™t go as expected.
