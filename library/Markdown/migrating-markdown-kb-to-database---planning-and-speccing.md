The information provided is for demonstrative purposes only and is intended to highlight constraints and capabilities in LLM applications and prompt engineering strategies.*


# Prompt
I am currently building up a local Obsidian knowledge base full of LLM outputs. I'm storing prompts and outputs in separate folders as markdown files. In time, however, I plan on moving this up to a postgres database. The migration will look something like this: for every output, I'll want to capture the created_at data from the metadata if that's possible. The file title will probably map onto a field called outputtitle. And then the actual content of the output will be added to a field called output_text. There are thousands of these outputs that I'll need to import so I'll definitely want to automate the process. Do you think this can be done with scripting?

# Output
Yes, this migration process can definitely be automated using scripting. Python is an excellent choice for this task due to its simplicity and robust libraries for file handling and database operations. Here's an outline of how you could approach this:

## Migration Process

1. **Read Markdown Files**: 
   Use Python to iterate through your Obsidian vault and read the markdown files containing your outputs.

2. **Extract Data**:
   Parse each markdown file to extract the required information:
   - Created date from metadata
   - File title
   - Content of the output

3. **Connect to PostgreSQL**:
   Establish a connection to your PostgreSQL database using a library like psycopg2.

4. **Insert Data**:
   For each processed markdown file, insert the extracted data into your PostgreSQL database.

## Sample Python Script

Here's a basic script that demonstrates this process:

```python
import os
import psycopg2
from datetime import datetime

# PostgreSQL connection parameters
db_params = {
    "database": "your_database",
    "user": "your_username",
    "password": "your_password",
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": "5432"
}

# Connect to PostgreSQL
conn = psycopg2.connect(**db_params)
cur = conn.cursor()

# Create table if not exists
cur.execute("""
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS llm_outputs (
        id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
        created_at TIMESTAMP,
        output_title TEXT,
        output_text TEXT
    )
""")

# Function to extract data from markdown file
def process_markdown_file(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        content = file.read()
        
    # Extract created_at from metadata (assuming it's in the format "created: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS")
    created_at = None
    for line in content.split('\n'):
        if line.startswith('created:'):
            created_at = datetime.strptime(line.split(':', 1)[1].strip(), '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')
            break
    
    # Extract title from filename
    output_title = os.path.splitext(os.path.basename(file_path))[0]
    
    # Extract content (assuming content starts after the metadata)
    output_text = '\n'.join(content.split('\n\n')[1:])
    
    return created_at, output_title, output_text

# Iterate through markdown files in the specified directory
output_directory = '/path/to/your/output/folder'
for filename in os.listdir(output_directory):
    if filename.endswith('.md'):
        file_path = os.path.join(output_directory, filename)
        created_at, output_title, output_text = process_markdown_file(file_path)
        
        # Insert data into PostgreSQL
        cur.execute("""
            INSERT INTO llm_outputs (created_at, output_title, output_text)
            VALUES (%s, %s, %s)
        """, (created_at, output_title, output_text))

# Commit changes and close connection
conn.commit()
cur.close()
conn.close()

print("Migration completed successfully!")
```

This script does the following:

1. Connects to your PostgreSQL database[1][2].
2. Creates a table called `llm_outputs` if it doesn't exist.
3. Defines a function to process each markdown file, extracting the required information.
4. Iterates through all markdown files in the specified directory.
5. For each file, it extracts the data and inserts it into the PostgreSQL database[1][2].

You'll need to adjust the script according to your specific needs, such as:

- Modifying the database connection parameters.
- Adjusting the file path to your Obsidian vault.
- Tweaking the data extraction logic if your markdown files have a different structure.

Remember to install the required Python libraries (psycopg2 for PostgreSQL interaction) before running the script[1][2].

This approach should allow you to automate the migration of thousands of outputs from your Obsidian vault to a PostgreSQL database efficiently[5]. As you run this script, it's a good idea to implement error handling and logging to track the migration process and handle any issues that may arise during the transfer of such a large amount of data.
