# Prompt
Let's think about how I might go about mirroring the data structure of my Output Hub project in Obsidian. There are three key components capturing prompts, prompt outputs, and custom GPT configs (ie, GPT agents). In the system as I have been developing it up to now there is also are also lots of lookup tables. Using a database, I've been able to relate the data through the classic methods of M2M etc. How might I go about doing this in a document based structure of markdown files? Bear in mind that some of the lookup tables may contain hundreds of values

# Output

Mirroring the relational data structure of your Output Hub project in a document-based environment like Obsidian requires using Markdown files creatively to simulate database relationships, including many-to-many (M2M) relationships and lookup tables. Here's a detailed approach on how you might go about this:

### 1. **Organize Your Core Components**
   - **Folders and Files:** Use folders and subfolders to categorize your core components: Prompts, Outputs, and GPT Configs.
   - **Naming Convention:** Establish a consistent naming convention for files to make linking and searching easier. For example:
     - `Prompts/2024-09-20_Prompt-1.md`
     - `Outputs/2024-09-20_Output-1.md`
     - `Configs/2024-09-20_Config-GPT3.md`

### 2. **Simulating Relationships Using Links**
   - **Internal Links:** In Obsidian, you can create internal links between Markdown files to simulate relationships.
   - **One-to-Many (1:M) Relationships:**
     - **Prompts to Outputs:** Within each `Prompt` note, include links to the associated `Output` notes.
       ```markdown
       ## Related Outputs
       - [[Outputs/2024-09-20_Output-1]]
       - [[Outputs/2024-09-20_Output-2]]
       ```
     - **Outputs to Configs:** Similarly, link from each `Output` note back to its associated `Config` note.
       ```markdown
       ## Associated GPT Config
       - [[Configs/2024-09-20_Config-GPT3]]
       ```

   - **Many-to-Many (M2M) Relationships:**
     - **Using Index Notes:** Create an index or summary note for each type of relationship. For instance, a `Prompt-Config Links.md` file that lists which prompts are linked to which configs.
       ```markdown
       ## Prompt to Config Relationships
       - Prompt: [[Prompts/2024-09-20_Prompt-1]] -> Config: [[Configs/2024-09-20_Config-GPT3]]
       - Prompt: [[Prompts/2024-09-21_Prompt-2]] -> Config: [[Configs/2024-09-20_Config-GPT4]]
       ```
     - **Bidirectional Linking:** Ensure that links are bidirectional by adding links to both related notes, thereby mimicking M2M relationships.

### 3. **Simulating Lookup Tables**
   - **Tagging:** Use tags to represent categories or classifications that would be handled by lookup tables in a relational database.
     - Example: `#category/machine-learning`, `#difficulty/easy`, etc.
   - **Dedicated Lookup Notes:**
     - Create a Markdown file that acts as a lookup table for each category of metadata.
     - Include a list of all possible values with links to notes that fall under each category.
       ```markdown
       # Machine Learning Models
       - [[Configs/2024-09-20_Config-GPT3]]
       - [[Configs/2024-09-21_Config-GPT4]]
       ```

   - **In-Note Lookup Lists:** 
     - For large lookup tables (e.g., hundreds of values), split the data into multiple notes (e.g., alphabetically, by category, etc.).
     - Use tags or links within these lookup notes to navigate between them.

### 4. **Handling Large Lookup Tables**
   - **Subfolders for Categorization:** Break large lookup tables into subcategories stored in subfolders.
     - Example: A `Models` folder with subfolders for each type of model (e.g., `Models/Transformer`, `Models/RNN`, etc.).
   - **Index Files:** Create an index note for each subcategory that links to the relevant items.
     ```markdown
     # Transformer Models
     - [[Models/Transformer/Model-1.md]]
     - [[Models/Transformer/Model-2.md]]
     ```

### 5. **Using Dataview Plugin for Advanced Queries**
   - **Install Dataview:** The Dataview plugin in Obsidian can simulate database queries, allowing you to generate lists of related notes dynamically based on metadata.
   - **Dataview Queries:** Use Dataview queries to pull information from notes based on tags, links, or other criteria.
     ```dataview
     table prompt, output, config
     from "Prompts"
     where contains(file.link, "Config")
     sort file.name asc
     ```
   - **Automate Relationships:** Automate the display of relationships without manually linking each note by using Dataview’s capabilities to cross-reference based on tags or metadata.

### 6. **Workflow Automation**
   - **Templates for Consistency:** Use Obsidian’s Templater plugin to create templates for Prompts, Outputs, and Configs. These templates can include placeholders for links to related notes, ensuring consistency.
   - **QuickAdd for Fast Note Creation:** Use the QuickAdd plugin to rapidly generate new notes in the correct format and folder, pre-populating the necessary links and metadata.

### Example Workflow
1. **Create a New Prompt:**
   - Use a hotkey to generate a new prompt note with sections for linking related outputs and configs.
   - Add tags or metadata for lookup table values.

2. **Capture Outputs:**
   - As outputs are generated, create new notes using your output template, linking them back to the relevant prompt and config.

3. **Review Relationships:**
   - Use Dataview queries in an index note to review all outputs associated with a specific config or all prompts associated with a category.

4. **Use Lookup Notes:**
   - Reference lookup notes as needed to maintain consistency and quickly find related items.

### Conclusion
By leveraging Obsidian’s linking capabilities, tags, and plugins like Dataview, you can effectively mirror a relational database structure within a Markdown-based environment. While it may not be as straightforward as using a traditional database, this approach allows you to maintain flexibility and portability in your knowledge management system.## Extracted Prompts
