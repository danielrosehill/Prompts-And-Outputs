# Output

To preview your awesome list in Markdown format in VS Code, there are a few options available. Here's how you can do it:

## Preview in VS Code

The easiest way to preview your Markdown file in VS Code is to use the built-in preview feature:

1. Open your Markdown file in VS Code.
2. Press `Ctrl + Shift + V` to open the preview in a new tab within VS Code[1][2].

This method allows you to see your Markdown rendered as it would appear when published, making it easy to spot and fix any formatting issues.

## Preview in a Separate Window

If you prefer to have the preview in a separate window, you can:

1. Open your Markdown file in VS Code.
2. Press `Ctrl + K` followed by `V` to open a side-by-side preview[1].
3. Drag the preview tab out of the VS Code window to create a separate window.

This approach gives you the flexibility to position the preview wherever you want on your screen.

## Preview in a Web Browser

While VS Code doesn't have a built-in feature to preview Markdown directly in a web browser, there are a few workarounds:

1. **Use a Chrome Extension**: If you use Chrome, you can install a Markdown rendering extension. Then, create a launch configuration in VS Code to open the current file in Chrome[3].

2. **Convert to HTML**: You can use a VS Code extension like "Markdown PDF" to convert your Markdown file to HTML, which you can then open in a browser[6].

3. **Use a Local Server**: Set up a local server that renders Markdown files as HTML, then open the file through that server in your browser.

## Recommendation

For the best experience while working on your awesome list, I recommend using the built-in VS Code preview (`Ctrl + Shift + V`). This method provides a quick and accurate representation of your Markdown without leaving the editor.

If you need to share the preview with others or want to see it in a browser environment, consider converting it to HTML or using a Markdown-rendering browser extension.

Remember, the built-in preview in VS Code updates in real-time as you edit, making it an efficient tool for crafting your awesome list.
