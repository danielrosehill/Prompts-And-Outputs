# Prompt

Let's say I want to do the following: concatenate every markdown file in a folder. I'll want to output the timestamp of generation in red at the footer of every page. And at the top I might want to put a privacy marker in red such as PRIVATE. Can I integrate that into the command?

# Output

To achieve what you want—concatenating all Markdown files in a folder into a single PDF, adding a **timestamp** and a **privacy marker** in red—you can still use **Pandoc** combined with **LaTeX** customizations. Pandoc allows you to use custom headers and footers via LaTeX templates to handle these specific formatting requirements.

Here’s a step-by-step guide on how you can accomplish this:

### **Step 1: Set Up the Folder Structure and File Naming**
- Assume all your Markdown files are located in a folder called `markdowns`.
- You want to concatenate all files and add a **timestamp** and **privacy label**.

### **Step 2: Install Required Tools**
Make sure **Pandoc** and **TeX Live** (for PDF generation) are installed. You might also need **xelatex** for handling custom LaTeX options and fonts more flexibly.

```bash
sudo dnf install pandoc texlive texlive-xetex
```

### **Step 3: Create a Custom LaTeX Template**
You need a LaTeX template that includes custom headers and footers for the **privacy marker** and **timestamp**. Create a new file called `custom-template.tex` with the following content:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
\usepackage{fancyhdr}
\usepackage{geometry}
\usepackage{color}

% Set page geometry
\geometry{a4paper, margin=1in}

% Setup header and footer
\pagestyle{fancy}
\fancyhf{}

% Privacy marker in the header
\fancyhead[C]{\textcolor{red}{PRIVATE}}

% Timestamp in the footer
\fancyfoot[C]{\textcolor{red}{Generated on: \today}}

% Main document
\begin{document}

$body$

\end{document}
```

### **Step 4: Use Pandoc to Concatenate and Generate the PDF**
- To concatenate all Markdown files in the `markdowns` folder and generate a PDF using your custom template, use the following command:

```bash
pandoc markdowns/*.md -o output.pdf --template=custom-template.tex --pdf-engine=xelatex
```

### **Step 5: Breakdown of How It Works**
- **Concatenation**: `markdowns/*.md` takes all Markdown files in the folder and concatenates them in the order they appear.
- **LaTeX Template**: The option `--template=custom-template.tex` tells Pandoc to use your custom template.
- **Privacy Marker**: The `\fancyhead[C]{\textcolor{red}{PRIVATE}}` command in the LaTeX template places "PRIVATE" at the center of the header on every page in red.
- **Timestamp**: The `\fancyfoot[C]{\textcolor{red}{Generated on: \today}}` command places the current date in the footer, centered on each page, in red.

### **Modifications for Custom Timestamp**
If you want a more detailed timestamp (including the time of generation):

1. Update the LaTeX command in `custom-template.tex`:
   ```latex
   \fancyfoot[C]{\textcolor{red}{Generated on: \today \ at \currenttime}}
   ```
2. You will also need to include the **datetime package** to make use of `\currenttime`:
   ```latex
   \usepackage{datetime}
   ```

### **Summary Command**
```bash
pandoc markdowns/*.md -o output.pdf --template=custom-template.tex --pdf-engine=xelatex
```

This command will:
- **Concatenate all Markdown files** in the `markdowns` folder.
- Generate a **PDF** with a **"PRIVATE"** marker at the top of every page and a **timestamp** in the footer, both in **red**.

### **Additional Tips**:
- **Order of Files**: The files will be concatenated in alphanumeric order. To control the order, make sure your file names are appropriately numbered or named.
- **Privacy Labels for Different Levels**: You can modify the `custom-template.tex` to dynamically change the privacy marker (e.g., PUBLIC, CONFIDENTIAL) by passing variables to Pandoc with `-V`. Example:
  ```bash
  pandoc markdowns/*.md -o output.pdf --template=custom-template.tex -V privacy=CONFIDENTIAL --pdf-engine=xelatex
  ```
  Update the template to accept the `privacy` variable for flexibility.

This should give you a streamlined way to create a professional-looking PDF with the desired customizations directly from your Markdown files on Fedora Linux. Let me know if you need more help tweaking this!
