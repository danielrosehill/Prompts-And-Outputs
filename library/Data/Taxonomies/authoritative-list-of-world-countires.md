The list of world countries is a somewhat contentious question. Some states claim to be independent nations but are not largely recognised. For the purpose of deciding what is and isn't a country, what is considered to be the authoritative resource

# Output

Determining what qualifies as a country can indeed be contentious, especially with entities that claim independence but are not widely recognized. However, there are a few authoritative resources and frameworks that are commonly used to determine statehood and recognition on the global stage:

### 1. **United Nations (UN)**
   - **Why It's Authoritative**: The **United Nations** is the most widely accepted international organization for recognizing sovereign states. A country’s membership in the UN is often used as a benchmark for its recognition as a nation.
   - **How it Works**: 
     - To become a UN member, a country must be recommended by the UN Security Council and approved by the General Assembly.
     - Currently, there are **193 member states** of the UN.
   - **Special Cases**: Some entities, like **Palestine** and the **Holy See (Vatican)**, hold "non-member observer state" status, meaning they have some degree of recognition but are not full members.

### 2. **International Recognition by Other States**
   - **Why It Matters**: Besides UN membership, international recognition by a majority of other countries plays a critical role. States can have varying degrees of recognition (e.g., Kosovo, Taiwan), with some recognized by only a subset of nations. These entities may not be UN members but are still considered de facto independent in practice.
   - **How It Works**: Recognition is typically established through diplomatic relations, treaties, or bilateral agreements.

### 3. **Montevideo Convention (1933)**
   - **Why It's Authoritative**: The **Montevideo Convention on the Rights and Duties of States** provides a widely cited legal definition of a sovereign state. According to this convention, a country must have:
     1. A **permanent population**,
     2. A defined **territory**,
     3. A **government**,
     4. The capacity to enter into **relations with other states**.
   - **How It Works**: While the convention primarily applies to the Americas, the criteria it establishes are often referenced in discussions on statehood.

### 4. **ISO 3166-1 Standard**
   - **Why It's Authoritative**: The **ISO 3166-1** standard, maintained by the **International Organization for Standardization (ISO)**, lists official country codes and names. The standard is widely used in international trade, finance, and data systems.
   - **How It Works**: The ISO list includes UN member states and some additional territories and regions, though it may list entities that are not universally recognized.

### 5. **World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF)**
   - **Why They're Authoritative**: Both the **World Bank** and **IMF** provide membership to sovereign states and certain territories, making them de facto acknowledgments of a country’s sovereignty. Their membership lists are often referenced in international economic contexts.

### 6. **Diplomatic Recognition and Bilateral Agreements**
   - **Why It Matters**: Some entities function as de facto states with some degree of international recognition but lack full recognition from key international bodies like the UN. **Taiwan** and **Kosovo** are examples of such cases, where some countries and organizations recognize them, but others do not.

### Summary of Authoritative Resources:
- **United Nations (UN) Membership**: The most widely accepted standard of recognition.
- **Montevideo Convention**: Provides the legal framework for defining statehood.
- **ISO 3166-1 Standard**: Often used in official documentation for country codes and names.
- **World Bank/IMF Membership**: Frequently used for economic and international development purposes.

In most global contexts, **UN membership** remains the most widely referenced and authoritative resource for determining whether an entity is considered a country, though contested cases are acknowledged by other resources such as the Montevideo Convention and ISO standards.
