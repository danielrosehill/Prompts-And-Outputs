Yes, there are tools available that can automatically scan images for Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and even blur sensitive information when detected. These tools use Optical Character Recognition (OCR) combined with machine learning algorithms to identify sensitive data like names, addresses, credit card numbers, and other personal information. Here are some tools that offer such functionality:

1. Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services

Azure Content Moderator: This service can be used to detect text in images, including sensitive or offensive content. You can integrate it with custom rules to blur detected PII.

Azure OCR API: It extracts text from images, and you can combine it with logic to scan for PII and automatically redact or blur the content.


2. Amazon Rekognition

Amazon Rekognition offers OCR capabilities to detect text in images. Combined with AWS Lambda or other automation services, you can build a solution that scans images for sensitive data and blurs it based on customizable rules.


3. Google Cloud Vision API

Google’s Vision API can detect text in images through OCR. You can pair this with a PII detection service, such as Google’s Data Loss Prevention (DLP) API, to blur or redact sensitive content automatically.


4. PII Scanner Tools

There are open-source and commercial PII scanning tools that can be used in combination with image processing libraries like OpenCV to blur sections of the image that contain sensitive text. Examples include:

Presidio (by Microsoft): A free and open-source tool for detecting and anonymizing PII. While it's primarily focused on text, it can be integrated with an image processing pipeline to detect and redact text from images.



5. Blur Private Information API (Custom Solution)

You can build a custom solution using libraries like Tesseract OCR to extract text from images, and combine it with PII detection algorithms to blur specific areas. This can be paired with image manipulation libraries like Pillow or OpenCV to programmatically blur the detected areas in the image.


These solutions often require some level of integration and customization but provide robust ways to automatically handle and obscure sensitive data in images.
