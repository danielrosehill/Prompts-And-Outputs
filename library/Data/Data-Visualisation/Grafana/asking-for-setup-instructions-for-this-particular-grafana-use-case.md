# Prompt

Can you suggest some ways that I can deploy my news monitoring dashboard on Grafana? 

The use case is this: I'm based in Israel and want to set up a dashboard panel for people to keep abreast of the news. I would like to be able to display some RSS feeds and embedded iframes showing news streams. 

I might wish to share this publicly down the line. But for now we can focus on getting it set up. 

Give me a list of plugins and configurations to make for this use case.

# Output

To set up a **news monitoring dashboard** in Grafana, you will need a combination of plugins, configurations, and data sources. Below is a list of essential plugins and configurations that can help you build the dashboard for displaying **RSS feeds**, **embedded news streams**, and possibly **social media content** (like Twitter).

### 1. **Data Source Plugins**
These plugins allow you to integrate external data sources (e.g., RSS feeds, APIs) into Grafana.

#### a. **JSON API Plugin**
- **Purpose**: Allows you to bring in data from REST APIs (like RSS feeds converted to JSON) into Grafana.
- **Install**: 
  - Go to **Configuration** > **Plugins**.
  - Search for and install the **JSON API** plugin.
  - This plugin will allow you to fetch data from APIs like `rss2json` to display RSS feed data.
  
#### b. **Simple XML Datasource Plugin**
- **Purpose**: Lets you scrape and parse XML-based data such as RSS feeds directly without converting them to JSON.
- **Install**: 
  - Go to **Configuration** > **Plugins**.
  - Search for and install the **Simple XML Datasource** plugin.
  - Useful for pulling in structured data from XML-based feeds.

#### c. **Web Page Panel (IFrame Plugin)**
- **Purpose**: Enables embedding websites or iframes into Grafana panels, useful for showing live news streams or web-based news tickers.
- **Install**:
  - Go to **Configuration** > **Plugins**.
  - Search for **Web Page Panel** or **IFrame Panel** plugin, which will allow you to embed news streams.
  - You can then use an iframe to display live content from news websites like CNN, BBC, etc.
  
#### d. **Feed Reader Plugin** (RSS)
- **Purpose**: Allows you to display RSS feed data in Grafana panels.
- **Install**:
  - Search for the **RSS Feed Reader Plugin**. This will enable you to directly visualize RSS feeds as Grafana panels without external API conversion.
  
### 2. **Visualization Plugins**
These plugins help with displaying different types of content in Grafana.

#### a. **Table Panel**
- **Purpose**: Displays structured data like RSS feed entries in table format (e.g., news headlines, timestamps, etc.).
- **Built-in**: This is a default Grafana panel.
- **Configuration**:
  - For RSS feeds, convert the data into a structured format (like JSON or XML) and visualize it in a table.
  - Columns can display information such as **headline**, **source**, **date**, and **description**.

#### b. **Text Panel**
- **Purpose**: Displays text, formatted data, or embedded HTML/iframes.
- **Built-in**: This is a default Grafana panel.
- **Use Case**:
  - Use the **HTML mode** to insert iframes of live news streams or embedded media.
  - Example:
    ```html
    <iframe src="https://www.cnn.com" width="100%" height="600px"></iframe>
    ```
    
#### c. **Stat Panel**
- **Purpose**: Displays important single values or counts.
- **Built-in**: This is a default Grafana panel.
- **Use Case**:
  - If you want to show a summary statistic like the **number of new articles** published today or breaking news counts, you can use the Stat Panel.
  
#### d. **Logs Panel**
- **Purpose**: Displays text-based logs.
- **Built-in**: This is a default Grafana panel.
- **Use Case**:
  - You can use it to display real-time news updates (if the data source sends updates in a log format, such as live RSS logs or social media feeds).

### 3. **Embedding Social Media Feeds**
If you want to embed social media content like **Twitter/X feeds** or **Reddit** in your news monitoring dashboard:

#### a. **Twitter/X Panel Plugin**
- **Purpose**: Allows embedding real-time Twitter feeds directly into Grafana.
- **Install**:
  - Go to **Configuration** > **Plugins**.
  - Search for **Twitter/X Feed** plugin.
  - Configure it with your API keys from Twitter to display live tweets in your dashboard.

#### b. **Reddit Panel Plugin**
- **Purpose**: Displays Reddit threads or subreddit posts within Grafana.
- **Install**:
  - Search for **Reddit Panel Plugin** and configure it with subreddit feeds related to the news.

### 4. **Panel Configurations**
Here are a few additional configurations to help you organize and customize the dashboard:

#### a. **Dashboard Layout**
- **Panels**: Organize your panels to show different types of content—e.g., one section for **RSS feeds** (using Table panels), one for **embedded live news streams** (using IFrame or Web Panel), and another for **social media feeds** (Twitter, Reddit).
- **Grid Layout**: Use Grafana's flexible grid layout to arrange your panels in a visually appealing manner. Set widths and heights that accommodate the news content.

#### b. **Auto-Refresh**
- For real-time news, configure your dashboard to refresh every few minutes:
  - Open **Dashboard Settings** > **Time Settings**.
  - Set the refresh rate, e.g., `1m` for refreshing every minute.
  
#### c. **Public Sharing**
- To share your dashboard with the public later on:
  - Go to **Dashboard Settings** > **Sharing**.
  - Enable **public link sharing**.
  - If you don’t want users to need authentication, enable anonymous viewing by modifying the Grafana configuration (`grafana.ini`) and setting:
    ```ini
    [auth.anonymous]
    enabled = true
    org_name = Main Org.
    org_role = Viewer
    ```

### 5. **Security Considerations**
While you plan to make the dashboard public later on, here are a few security configurations to harden the setup:

#### a. **Protect Grafana Admin/Editor Logins**
- Use strong passwords for Grafana users with **Admin** or **Editor** roles.
- If you're sharing the dashboard publicly, use Grafana’s **anonymous** mode for viewers, but restrict **edit** and **admin** access.

#### b. **Reverse Proxy with Nginx**
- Set up **Nginx** as a reverse proxy in front of Grafana. This allows you to hide certain paths (e.g., the login path) and secure it with HTTPS using **Let’s Encrypt** SSL certificates.

   Example Nginx config to hide the login page:
   ```nginx
   server {
       listen 80;
       server_name example.com;

       location /grafana/ {
           proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
       }

       location /secret-login/ {
           proxy_pass http://localhost:3000/login;
       }

       # Block direct access to the standard login URL
       location /login {
           return 404;
       }
   }
   ```

#### c. **TLS/SSL Encryption**
- Ensure that Grafana is running over **HTTPS** to secure any login or sensitive content by using a free **Let’s Encrypt SSL certificate**.

### Final Steps:
- Install the necessary plugins and configure your data sources.
- Design the dashboard layout by adding panels for websites, RSS feeds, and other real-time data sources.
- Test the setup internally before deciding whether to share it publicly.

Once configured, this setup will give you a dynamic news monitoring dashboard that you can refine over time and eventually share with others.
