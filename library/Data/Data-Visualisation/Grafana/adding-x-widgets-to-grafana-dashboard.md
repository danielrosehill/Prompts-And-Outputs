Grafana is primarily designed for data visualization from time-series data sources like databases, APIs, and logs, but it is possible to integrate **social media monitoring** into Grafana by leveraging external tools and APIs to pull in data, including from platforms like **X (formerly Twitter)**. Here's how you can set up social media monitoring widgets in Grafana, particularly for an X timeline or hashtag monitor.

### 1. **Use APIs to Fetch Data from X (Twitter)**

You can use the X API (formerly Twitter API) to pull in data such as a user’s timeline or hashtag mentions. This requires setting up an integration between X’s API and Grafana. You’ll need to process the API responses and feed the data into a data source that Grafana can visualize.

#### Steps:

1. **Sign up for X API Access:**
   - Apply for access to the X API via the [X Developer Portal](https://developer.twitter.com/).
   - Once you have API access, you can generate the API keys needed to make authenticated requests for timelines or hashtags.

2. **Set Up a Custom Data Source**:
   - You need to fetch data from the X API and store it in a format that Grafana can query, such as a **database** (PostgreSQL, InfluxDB, etc.) or a **Prometheus** endpoint.
   - You can write a **Python script** or use an existing service to periodically fetch data from X and insert it into your database or data source.

3. **Write a Python Script to Fetch Data**:
   Here's a simple example to fetch data from X’s API for a specific hashtag:

   ```python
   import requests
   import json

   BEARER_TOKEN = 'your_x_api_bearer_token'

   def get_hashtag_tweets(hashtag):
       url = f"https://api.twitter.com/2/tweets/search/recent?query={hashtag}&tweet.fields=created_at"
       headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {BEARER_TOKEN}"}
       response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
       return response.json()

   # Example call
   tweets = get_hashtag_tweets("#YourHashtag")
   print(json.dumps(tweets, indent=4))
   ```

   - Fetch tweets containing a specific hashtag or from a timeline and store the results in your data source.
   - Periodically run this script to keep the data updated.

4. **Integrate with Grafana**:
   - Use **Grafana’s built-in data sources** (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, or InfluxDB) to connect to the database where your X data is stored.
   - Create a **dashboard** and add a **Table panel** or **Graph panel** to visualize the tweet data, timelines, or hashtag mentions.

### 2. **Use Third-Party Tools for Social Media Monitoring**

There are also third-party services that specialize in social media monitoring and can provide this data in a format Grafana can read.

#### a. **IFTTT (If This Then That)**
   - **What It Does**: IFTTT allows you to create workflows that trigger actions based on social media activity. For instance, you can trigger a workflow when a specific hashtag is used.
   - **Integration with Grafana**: You can use IFTTT to store the data in a Google Sheet, database, or webhook, which Grafana can then query.
   - **How to Use**:
     1. Set up a trigger in IFTTT for a specific X hashtag or user.
     2. Store the resulting data in a database or service Grafana can query (e.g., Google Sheets or a cloud service).

#### b. **Zapier**
   - **What It Does**: Similar to IFTTT, Zapier allows you to create automated workflows. You can set up a Zap that triggers when there is a new tweet containing a hashtag.
   - **Integration with Grafana**: You can have Zapier write data to a database or use webhooks to push data to a custom API that Grafana queries.
   - **How to Use**:
     1. Set up a Zap to trigger on hashtag mentions or user tweets.
     2. Store the data in a format Grafana can read, such as a database or JSON feed.

### 3. **Use a Web Scraping Service or Tool**

If you are unable to use the X API, you can consider using a **web scraping service** to monitor specific timelines or hashtags and push the data into Grafana.

#### Tools:
- **Scrapy** (Python): Scrapy can be set up to scrape X timelines or search results.
- **Apify**: Apify provides pre-built scrapers for X that you can use to gather data and feed into Grafana.
- **Puppeteer** (Node.js): Puppeteer is a headless browser automation tool that can scrape websites like X for specific content.

After scraping the data, you can store it in a database like MySQL or InfluxDB, which Grafana can query.

### 4. **Embed Social Media Widgets (Alternative Method)**

While Grafana itself doesn’t directly support iframe embedding of social media timelines, you could use the **Text Panel** or **HTML plugin** to embed external widgets for timelines.

#### Steps:
1. **Obtain the Embeddable Widget from X**:
   - Go to the [Twitter Publish](https://publish.twitter.com/) site.
   - Generate an embeddable widget for a specific hashtag or user timeline.

2. **Add the Embed Code to Grafana**:
   - Add a **Text Panel** or **HTML Panel** in Grafana.
   - Switch the panel to **HTML mode**.
   - Paste the embed code for the X widget:
     ```html
     <a class="twitter-timeline" href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/YourHashtag">#YourHashtag Tweets</a>
     <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
     ```

3. **Apply and Save the Panel**:
   - You will now have an embedded X timeline or hashtag monitor directly in your Grafana dashboard.

### Summary:
- For **API-based integration**, use the X API to pull hashtag mentions or timeline data into a database that Grafana can visualize.
- For **automation**, tools like IFTTT or Zapier can send social media data to Grafana-compatible data sources.
- Alternatively, you can **embed X widgets** directly into Grafana using a Text or HTML panel.
