Yes, it's entirely possible to create geovisualizations based on country-level data, even if specific coordinates or geometries are not included in the data. Many geovisualization tools and libraries can intelligently match countries to their geographic boundaries based on the country name. Hereâ€™s how you can approach this:

### 1. **Using Country Names for Geovisualizations**

Many geovisualization libraries and tools have built-in mapping for countries and can use the country names in your data to match them to the correct geographic boundaries. For example:

- **GeoJSON Boundaries**: Many countries and regions have pre-defined boundaries in GeoJSON format, which you can combine with your data based on the country name. Tools can overlay your data on these pre-existing boundaries to create visualizations.
- **Choropleth Maps**: These maps are a common way to visualize data associated with geographic regions. Your data (e.g., values of "PM25" or "Primary Health") can be aggregated and color-coded on a map of the world or specific regions.

### 2. **Tools and Libraries**

Here are some popular tools and libraries that can intelligently match country names to their geographies and visualize the data:

#### A. **Kepler.gl**
   - **Overview**: Kepler.gl is a powerful geospatial analysis tool by Uber that allows you to upload data (CSV, JSON, etc.) and instantly visualize it. It can auto-match country names to their geographic locations.
   - **Usage**: You can upload your JSON or CSV file with country-level data, and Kepler.gl can map it onto geographic boundaries without needing specific coordinates.

#### B. **Tableau**
   - **Overview**: Tableau is a widely-used data visualization tool that supports geospatial visualizations. It can auto-detect countries from your data and plot them on a map.
   - **Usage**: Simply upload your dataset to Tableau, and it will map the country names to predefined geographic boundaries.

#### C. **Plotly (Python/JavaScript)**
   - **Overview**: Plotly is a flexible visualization library that supports geospatial data. It has built-in country boundary shapes, and you can map country names from your data onto those shapes.
   - **Usage**: Using Plotly's choropleth map functions, you can input your country-level data and create interactive maps.
   
#### D. **Leaflet (JavaScript)**
   - **Overview**: Leaflet is a popular open-source JavaScript library for interactive maps. It supports GeoJSON and can display country-level data on maps.
   - **Usage**: You can create a simple GeoJSON with country names and match it to pre-existing GeoJSON boundary files for each country.

#### E. **Google Data Studio (or Looker Studio)**
   - **Overview**: Google Data Studio supports geospatial data visualization. Like Tableau, it can auto-detect country names from your data.
   - **Usage**: Import your data, and Google Data Studio will automatically map the country names to their respective geographies.

### 3. **GeoJSON Conversion for Countries**
   - You can also match your country data with a GeoJSON file that contains the boundaries for all countries. There are freely available world country GeoJSON files that you can merge with your data to create visualizations in libraries like Leaflet or Plotly.

### Example Workflow for Visualizing Country-Level Data:

1. **Prepare the Data**: Ensure that your country names in the JSON match standard country names used in GeoJSON files or your tool of choice.
   
2. **Load the Data**: Use one of the visualization tools mentioned (Kepler.gl, Tableau, Plotly, etc.) to load your data.

3. **Match Country Names**: Most of these tools will automatically match the country names in your data to the geographic boundaries for that country.

4. **Customize the Visualization**: You can use color scales, tooltips, and other interactive elements to highlight your data on the map.

### Conclusion

While your dataset lacks specific coordinates, many geovisualization tools can still create meaningful visualizations using country names as the linking factor. Tools like Kepler.gl, Tableau, Plotly, or Leaflet can help you match country names to geographic boundaries and display the data on interactive maps.
