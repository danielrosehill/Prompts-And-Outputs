Yes, there are several open-source mapping tools that you can use to create **geovisualizations** and overlay your own datasets on world maps. These tools provide flexible platforms to create custom visualizations, plot geospatial data, and display relationships between data and geographic locations.

### 1. **Leaflet.js**
   - **Description**: Leaflet is a widely-used open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly, interactive maps. It allows you to overlay data on top of a world map, with custom markers, shapes, and pop-ups.
   - **Use Cases**: You can plot points like countries with diplomatic changes, use layers to represent different statuses (e.g., countries that have recalled ambassadors, cut ties, etc.), and use geoJSON to display regions.
   - **License**: BSD-2-Clause.
   - **Website**: [Leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/)

### 2. **GeoServer**
   - **Description**: GeoServer is an open-source server that allows you to share, process, and edit geospatial data. It supports Web Map Service (WMS), Web Feature Service (WFS), and various data formats such as shapefiles and geoJSON.
   - **Use Cases**: Ideal for serving dynamic maps in a web application, GeoServer allows you to upload shapefiles of world maps and overlay your custom dataset on them.
   - **License**: GPL 2.0.
   - **Website**: [GeoServer](http://geoserver.org/)

### 3. **QGIS (Quantum GIS)**
   - **Description**: QGIS is a free, open-source Geographic Information System (GIS) that supports viewing, editing, and analyzing geospatial data. It provides a highly flexible interface for plotting geospatial data on world maps.
   - **Use Cases**: You can use QGIS to create static or dynamic maps, add custom datasets (like diplomatic relations), and style your maps for clear visualizations. It supports exporting maps in various formats like PNG, PDF, or web map layers.
   - **License**: GPL 2.0.
   - **Website**: [QGIS](https://qgis.org/)

### 4. **OpenLayers**
   - **Description**: OpenLayers is a powerful, open-source JavaScript library for displaying map data in web browsers. Like Leaflet, it provides tools to plot custom data, but with additional support for complex geospatial functions.
   - **Use Cases**: OpenLayers is great for creating interactive maps with various layers of geographic data, including custom datasets such as countries that have changed diplomatic relations.
   - **License**: BSD License.
   - **Website**: [OpenLayers](https://openlayers.org/)

### 5. **D3.js with topoJSON**
   - **Description**: D3.js is a versatile JavaScript library for creating dynamic, interactive data visualizations, and with **topoJSON** (an extension for topological geoJSON), you can plot geographic data on world maps.
   - **Use Cases**: D3.js is perfect for building fully customized maps with detailed data visualizations. You can represent diplomatic shifts and other datasets in a variety of ways, such as choropleths, bubbles, and custom interactive maps.
   - **License**: BSD License.
   - **Website**: [D3.js](https://d3js.org/)

### 6. **Mapbox**
   - **Description**: Mapbox offers open-source libraries for interactive maps that are easy to integrate into web applications. While Mapbox itself has commercial offerings, its core mapping libraries, such as **Mapbox GL JS**, are open source.
   - **Use Cases**: Mapbox allows for custom layers, markers, and extensive styling. You can use it to create a custom world map overlayed with diplomatic data. It also supports real-time updates if needed.
   - **License**: BSD License.
   - **Website**: [Mapbox GL JS](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js)

### 7. **Carto**
   - **Description**: While **Carto** offers a commercial mapping platform, they have an open-source library (Carto.js) that can be used to integrate geospatial data and maps into your web application.
   - **Use Cases**: It can be used for quick geospatial visualizations and embedding interactive maps into dashboards or websites.
   - **License**: LGPL.
   - **Website**: [Carto.js](https://carto.com/developers/carto-js/)

### Example Use Case: Visualizing Diplomatic Changes on a World Map
1. **Prepare Data**: Collect the data of countries that have recalled ambassadors or severed relations with Israel.
2. **Choose a Tool**: For example, you could use **Leaflet.js** or **OpenLayers** for web-based visualizations, or **QGIS** for more detailed, static maps.
3. **Plot the Data**: Use geoJSON or other geospatial data formats to plot countries on the map. Countries can be color-coded based on the type of diplomatic change (e.g., severed relations, recalled ambassadors, etc.).
4. **Interactive Features**: Add pop-ups or tooltips to display more information when a user clicks on a country.

These open-source tools provide you with flexible options to create and share your custom geospatial visualizations on diplomatic relations or any other datasets.
