# Prompt
ou might remember that I work with a lot of data related to the world of impact investing. One of the most interesting datasets is an open source project which shares outcomes funds taking place around the world. There are a lot of interesting relationships in this data as the projects are spread all over the world. For fun and as an experiment, I'd be interested in looking into some data visualisation platforms that could display these relationships. Manually geolocating the funds is quite a lot of work so I'm looking for a tool that can has AI capabilities which can take out some of the grunt work. Can you think of any tools?

# Output
Given your focus on visualizing relationships in global outcomes funds, particularly with the need to simplify the geolocation process, here are some AI-powered data visualization platforms that might be useful:

1. **Kepler.gl**:
   - **Overview**: Kepler.gl is an open-source geospatial analysis tool created by Uber. It’s designed for large-scale geospatial data visualization and can automatically map and visualize geographic data. Kepler.gl also integrates with AI tools to simplify the geolocation process, making it ideal for your needs.
   - **AI Capabilities**: It can handle geolocation tasks with minimal manual intervention and automatically cluster and visualize data points based on their geographic attributes.

2. **Carto**:
   - **Overview**: Carto is a powerful platform for location intelligence and spatial data analysis. It offers a suite of tools to visualize geospatial data, including AI-driven geocoding services that can automatically determine the locations of data points.
   - **AI Capabilities**: Carto’s geocoding API can automatically assign latitude and longitude to addresses or location names in your dataset, significantly reducing manual effort.

3. **Google Earth Engine**:
   - **Overview**: Google Earth Engine is a cloud-based platform for large-scale environmental data analysis. It’s designed for geospatial data and allows you to visualize complex relationships between data points on a global scale.
   - **AI Capabilities**: Google Earth Engine can integrate with machine learning models to process and visualize geographic data, automating much of the geolocation and analysis work.

4. **Esri ArcGIS**:
   - **Overview**: ArcGIS is one of the most comprehensive GIS platforms available, offering robust tools for mapping and spatial analysis. It includes AI and machine learning tools that can automate many geospatial tasks, including geolocation and data clustering.
   - **AI Capabilities**: ArcGIS’s GeoAI tools can process and analyze large datasets, automatically identifying patterns and relationships in geospatial data.

5. **Mapbox**:
   - **Overview**: Mapbox is a popular tool for creating custom maps and visualizations. It’s known for its flexibility and ease of use and offers AI-driven tools for processing geospatial data.
   - **AI Capabilities**: Mapbox integrates with AI tools that can assist with geolocation, allowing you to quickly map data points without needing to manually input geographic coordinates.

6. **Datawrapper**:
   - **Overview**: Datawrapper is a user-friendly tool for creating charts, maps, and visualizations. It’s not as robust in terms of AI as some other tools, but it does have geocoding capabilities that can help automate the process of mapping locations.
   - **AI Capabilities**: While not heavily AI-driven, Datawrapper can automatically map geographic data based on place names or addresses in your dataset.

7. **QGIS with Plugins**:
   - **Overview**: QGIS is an open-source GIS tool that offers extensive functionality for spatial data analysis. With the right plugins, QGIS can integrate AI and machine learning tools to enhance geolocation and data visualization.
   - **AI Capabilities**: Plugins like GeoAI or integration with Python scripts can automate much of the geolocation and data processing work in QGIS.

These platforms should help you visualize the relationships between global outcomes funds more efficiently by leveraging AI to reduce the manual workload associated with geolocation and mapping.## Extracted Prompts
