Yes, there are global embargo and sanctions databases that track which countries are imposing embargos upon one another. These databases are typically maintained by international organizations, governments, and specialized platforms that monitor sanctions, embargoes, and trade restrictions. Here are some key resources you can explore:

### 1. **UN Arms Embargo Database**
   - The **United Nations** maintains an arms embargo database as part of its broader sanctions monitoring. This resource provides details on arms embargoes imposed by the **UN Security Council**, which can include restrictions on specific countries or entities.
   - **Website**: [UN Security Council Sanctions Committees](https://www.un.org/securitycouncil/sanctions/information)

### 2. **SanctionsMap (European Union)**
   - The **EU Sanctions Map** is an interactive tool that provides real-time information on sanctions imposed by the European Union. It covers a wide range of sanctions, including arms embargoes, financial restrictions, and other trade sanctions.
   - **Website**: [EU SanctionsMap](https://www.sanctionsmap.eu/#/main)

### 3. **U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)**
   - The **Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)**, part of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, manages and publishes lists of countries and entities subject to U.S. sanctions. OFAC sanctions typically cover financial transactions, trade, and arms exports.
   - **Website**: [OFAC Sanctions List Search](https://sanctionssearch.ofac.treas.gov/)

### 4. **Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) Arms Transfers Database**
   - **SIPRI** tracks international arms transfers, including arms embargoes, and provides data on military exports and imports between countries. While it primarily focuses on arms, it also highlights embargos and sanctions related to military goods.

### 5. **Global Sanctions Database (GSD)**
   - The **Global Sanctions Database** is an academic resource tracking the imposition of sanctions across countries. It covers various types of sanctions, including trade embargoes and restrictions on arms transfers. It's widely used by researchers and policymakers for global sanctions analysis.

### 6. **World Bank Sanctions Board**
   - The **World Bank** sanctions board tracks sanctions and embargos imposed by the World Bank in relation to violations of its policies. While not a primary embargo database, it offers information on international restrictions related to economic and financial misconduct.

### 7. **Trade Embargo Data (Various Governmental Bodies)**
   - Many countries maintain their own databases tracking trade embargos and restrictions. For example, the **U.S. Department of Commerce** tracks trade-related sanctions, and similar databases are available from the **UK**, **Canada**, and other countries. These are valuable for industry-specific and region-specific restrictions.

These databases are invaluable for tracking ongoing embargoes and understanding which countries impose restrictions on trade and arms, offering up-to-date information for researchers, businesses, and policymakers.
