In most cases, layering the database with an API and connecting frontends to the API, rather than allowing direct access to the database, is the better approach. Here are some key reasons why:

### 1. **Security**

\- **API Layer**: An API acts as a controlled gateway to your database, allowing you to implement security measures such as authentication, authorization, and input validation. You can enforce strict access controls, ensuring that only authorized users can perform specific actions on the database.

\- **Direct Database Access**: Allowing direct access to the database from the frontend opens up significant security risks. If an attacker gains access to the frontend, they could potentially execute arbitrary queries, leading to data breaches, SQL injection attacks, or unauthorized data manipulation.

### 2. **Abstraction and Decoupling**

\- **API Layer**: An API abstracts the underlying database structure, allowing you to change the database schema or switch to a different database technology without impacting the frontend. This decoupling simplifies maintenance and future development.

\- **Direct Database Access**: Direct access tightly couples the frontend to the database schema. Any changes in the database structure would require changes to the frontend, increasing the complexity and risk of breaking functionality.

### 3. **Data Validation and Consistency**

\- **API Layer**: With an API, you can implement data validation and enforce business logic at a central point before data is written to the database. This helps maintain data integrity and consistency across your application.

\- **Direct Database Access**: If the frontend connects directly to the database, each frontend component is responsible for data validation, leading to potential inconsistencies and duplication of validation logic.

### 4. **Performance Optimization**

\- **API Layer**: An API can be optimized to reduce the number of database queries, aggregate data, and serve only the required information to the frontend. You can also implement caching strategies to improve performance.

\- **Direct Database Access**: Direct access can lead to inefficient queries and over-fetching of data, as the frontend may not be optimized for querying complex database schemas.

### 5. **Logging and Monitoring**

\- **API Layer**: APIs provide a centralized point for logging and monitoring all interactions with the database. This makes it easier to track usage, debug issues, and identify suspicious activities.

\- **Direct Database Access**: With direct access, it becomes more challenging to monitor and log database interactions, making it harder to detect and troubleshoot issues.

### 6. **Scalability**

\- **API Layer**: APIs allow for horizontal scaling by distributing the load across multiple API servers. This architecture can handle increasing traffic and scale more effectively.

\- **Direct Database Access**: Direct connections from frontend clients can overwhelm the database, especially as the number of clients grows, leading to performance bottlenecks.

### 7. **Flexibility**

\- **API Layer**: APIs can expose multiple endpoints for different clients (e.g., mobile apps, web apps) tailored to their specific needs. This flexibility allows different frontends to interact with the database in different ways, all while maintaining a consistent backend.

\- **Direct Database Access**: A single schema or query structure might not be suitable for different types of frontends, leading to challenges in accommodating diverse client needs.

### 8. **Compliance and Governance**

\- **API Layer**: An API layer makes it easier to enforce compliance with data protection regulations (like GDPR) by controlling what data is exposed and ensuring that sensitive information is handled properly.

\- **Direct Database Access**: Direct access increases the risk of exposing sensitive data and makes it harder to ensure compliance with regulations.

### Conclusion

**Using an API layer between your frontend and database is generally the better choice** due to the added security, abstraction, and control it provides. While direct database access might be suitable for simple applications or internal tools with strict access controls, for most production environments, especially those that require scalability, security, and maintainability, an API layer is essential.
