Changing the schema of a data application, such as adding or deleting fields, is not inherently bad practice, but it does require careful management to ensure data integrity and application stability. Here's how to deal with evolving data needs while maintaining a robust schema:

### 1. **Schema Evolution and Versioning**

\- **Plan for Schema Evolution:** Recognize that schemas are likely to change over time as business requirements evolve. Design your application with schema evolution in mind, allowing for flexibility.

\- **Version Control:** Use version control for your database schema changes, just as you would for your application code. Tools like Flyway or Liquibase can help manage and track schema changes.

### 2. **Adding New Fields**

\- **Backward Compatibility:** When adding new fields, ensure that the changes are backward-compatible. This means older versions of the application should still function without needing to recognize the new field.

\- **Default Values:** When adding a new field, consider providing a default value or allowing `NULL` to avoid breaking existing records.

### 3. **Deleting or Deprecating Fields**

\- **Soft Deprecation:** Instead of immediately deleting a field, mark it as deprecated and stop using it in the application. This allows time to ensure the field is truly obsolete and that no part of the application still depends on it.

\- **Migration:** Before deleting a field, ensure that all data dependent on it is either migrated to a new structure or that the data is no longer needed.

\- **Gradual Removal:** If you're certain a field is no longer needed, remove it gradually. First, stop populating it, then remove references in your code, and finally, remove it from the schema in a later version.

### 4. **Handling Legacy Data**

\- **Historical Data:** Sometimes, it's important to keep old data structures intact for historical reference. In such cases, consider moving deprecated fields to an archive table or maintaining old schema versions for read-only purposes.

\- **Data Migration:** When you change the schema, especially if you're removing fields, you may need to migrate existing data to fit the new schema. Automated migration scripts can help in this process.

### 5. **Communication and Documentation**

\- **Document Changes:** Every schema change should be well-documented, including the reason for the change, how it affects the application, and any steps required for migration.

\- **Notify Stakeholders:** Ensure that all stakeholders, including developers, data analysts, and end-users, are aware of schema changes and their implications.

### 6. **Testing**

\- **Test Thoroughly:** Every schema change should be thoroughly tested in a staging environment before being applied to production. Ensure that all related application features work correctly with the new schema.

### Should Old Columns Never Be Removed?

Old columns can be removed, but only after careful consideration and following a phased approach. Immediate removal without adequate planning can lead to data loss, application errors, and a poor user experience.

In summary, while changing the schema of a data application is not bad practice, it must be done thoughtfully and strategically. Planning for schema evolution, employing backward compatibility, and thoroughly testing changes are key practices to ensure that evolving data needs are met without compromising the integrity and functionality of the application.
