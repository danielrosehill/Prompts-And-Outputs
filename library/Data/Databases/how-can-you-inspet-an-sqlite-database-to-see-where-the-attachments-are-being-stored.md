To inspect an **SQLite** database and determine where the application is storing attachments, you need to interact with the database and examine its structure and contents. You can do this using the `sqlite3` command-line tool or a GUI tool, depending on your preference.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to inspecting the **SQLite database** using the `sqlite3` command-line tool to find where attachments are stored:

### 1. **Install `sqlite3` (if not already installed)**
On most Linux systems, you can install it with:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install sqlite3
```

### 2. **Open the SQLite Database**

To open the database (assuming it's named `homebox.db`), use the following command:
```bash
sqlite3 /path/to/homebox.db
```

### 3. **List the Tables in the Database**

Once you're inside the SQLite prompt, you can list all the tables in the database:
```sql
.tables
```

This will display the names of all tables, which will give you an idea of the database structure.

### 4. **Inspect the Schema of a Specific Table**

To get detailed information about a specific table (such as `attachments` or something similar where files may be stored), use the following command:
```sql
.schema table_name
```
Replace `table_name` with the name of the table you want to inspect. This command shows you the structure of the table, including column names and types.

### 5. **Look for Fields That Might Contain Attachment Data**

Look for tables or columns that might refer to attachments, such as:
- `attachment`, `file`, `document`, `data`, or `blob` columns
- `attachment_path`, `file_path`, or similar column names

If attachments are stored as **file paths**, you'll likely find a column like `file_path` or `attachment_path`. If attachments are stored **directly in the database** as binary data, look for columns of type **BLOB** (Binary Large Object).

### 6. **Query the Database**

Once you've identified a table that might store attachments, you can run a query to see how attachments are stored. For example, if the table is named `attachments`:

```sql
SELECT * FROM attachments LIMIT 10;
```

This will show you the first 10 records in the `attachments` table. Look for columns that contain paths or binary data.

### 7. **Exit the SQLite Command-Line**

Once you've gathered the information you need, you can exit the SQLite prompt by typing:
```sql
.exit
```

### Example Workflow

1. **Open the SQLite database**:
   ```bash
   sqlite3 /path/to/homebox.db
   ```

2. **List all tables**:
   ```sql
   .tables
   ```

3. **Examine the structure of an `attachments` table** (or another table that might store attachments):
   ```sql
   .schema attachments
   ```

4. **Query the table** to check for attachment-related columns or data:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM attachments LIMIT 10;
   ```

### Optional: Using a GUI for Easier Inspection

If you'd prefer a **graphical interface** for inspecting the SQLite database, you can use one of the following tools:
- **DB Browser for SQLite** (Linux/Windows/macOS)
- **SQLiteStudio**

You can download and install **DB Browser for SQLite** on Ubuntu like this:
```bash
sudo apt install sqlitebrowser
```

This GUI tool will allow you to browse tables, run queries, and inspect the database visually.

### Conclusion:
- Use `sqlite3` or a GUI tool like **DB Browser for SQLite** to inspect the tables and columns of your database.
- Look for columns that store file paths or binary data (BLOBs) related to attachments.
