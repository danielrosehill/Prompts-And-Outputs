*Note: this repository consists of the outputs of large language models (LLMs). In many cases, these are unedited or minimally edited. The information provided is for demonstrative purposes only and is intended to highlight constraints and capabilities in LLM applications and prompt engineering strategies.*


# Prompt

Great. Now please create a simplified version of the project definition. In the simplified version, let's forget about running the prompts through an API. Instead, we'll just create an interface for the user to copy and paste this data from somewhere else into the app. But we'll still want to save prompts and outputs and relate them as we discussed before.

# Output

Certainly! Here's a simplified version of the project definition for Output Hub, focusing on manual input of prompts and outputs without the LLM API integration:

Project Name: Output Hub (Simplified Version)

Objective:
Create a web-based application for managing and organizing LLM (Language Model) prompts and outputs, with manual input capabilities.

Technology Stack:
1. Backend:
   - Database: MongoDB
   - ODM (Object Document Mapper): Mongoose
   - Server: Node.js with Express.js
   - Admin Panel: AdminJS (formerly AdminBro)

2. Frontend:
   - AdminJS-generated interface with custom components as needed

Core Features:
1. Agent Management:
   - CRUD operations for custom LLM agents
   - Store basic agent information (name, description)

2. Prompt Management:
   - CRUD operations for prompts
   - Ability to input and edit prompt content manually

3. Output Management:
   - CRUD operations for outputs
   - Manual input of output content
   - Link outputs to corresponding prompts and agents

4. Metadata and Tagging:
   - Add custom metadata to outputs (e.g., programming languages used)
   - Implement a simple tagging system

5. Follow-up Activities:
   - Create and manage follow-up tasks related to specific outputs

6. Relationship Management:
   - Maintain and display relationships between agents, prompts, and outputs

Data Model:
1. Agents Collection
2. Prompts Collection
3. Outputs Collection
4. FollowUpActivities Collection

User Interface:
- Admin panel for CRUD operations on all collections
- Custom forms for inputting prompt and output content
- Display of relationships between entities

Additional Requirements:
1. User Authentication: Basic authentication for accessing the admin panel
2. Data Validation: Use Mongoose schemas for data validation
3. Error Handling: Implement error handling for database operations

Development Approach:
1. Define Mongoose schemas locally
2. Set up AdminJS for basic CRUD operations
3. Implement custom AdminJS components for manual input of prompts and outputs
4. Develop features to display relationships between entities

This simplified version focuses on creating a manageable system for organizing LLM-related data without the complexity of direct API integration. It provides a solid foundation that can be extended in the future if needed.
