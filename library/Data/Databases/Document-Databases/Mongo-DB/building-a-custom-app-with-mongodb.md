# Prompt

Lets assume that I'd need to build something from scratch / custom. How might I go about developing the frontend using MongoDB on the backend? You have context about the idea
# Output

Given the context of your Output Hub system and the requirement to build a custom solution using MongoDB on the backend, here's how you might approach developing the frontend:

1. Choose a Frontend Framework:
   Based on your needs for a flexible, scalable system that can handle complex relationships between prompts, outputs, and agents, I would recommend using React.js. React offers a component-based architecture that aligns well with your modular requirements and has excellent performance for handling large amounts of data.

2. Set Up the Project:
   - Use Create React App or Next.js to set up your React project.
   - Set up a Node.js backend with Express.js to serve as an API layer between your React frontend and MongoDB database.

3. Design the Frontend Architecture:
   - Create components for Agents, Prompts, and Outputs.
   - Implement a main dashboard view that displays summaries of each section.
   - Design views for listing, creating, editing, and deleting items in each category.
   - Create a view for running prompts and displaying outputs.

4. Implement Key Features:
   - Prompt Library: Create a component to display and manage prompts. Include functionality to move prompts from "Drafting" to "Run" status.
   - Output Display: Design a component to show outputs, including metadata and relationships to prompts and agents.
   - Agent Configuration: Develop a component for managing LLM agent configurations.
   - Metadata Management: Create forms and displays for custom metadata on outputs and prompts.
   - Relationship Visualization: Implement a way to show connections between prompts, outputs, and agents.

5. State Management:
   Use React Context API or Redux for global state management, which will be crucial for maintaining relationships between your data entities.

6. API Integration:
   - Create a service layer in your React app to handle API calls to your Node.js backend.
   - Implement CRUD operations for each entity type (Agents, Prompts, Outputs).
   - Create an API endpoint for running prompts and receiving outputs.

7. Data Fetching and Caching:
   Use a library like React Query or SWR for efficient data fetching, caching, and state synchronization between the frontend and backend.

8. Styling:
   Use a CSS-in-JS solution like styled-components or a UI library like Material-UI for consistent styling and theming.

9. Search and Filter Functionality:
   Implement search and filter components that leverage MongoDB's text search capabilities on the backend.

10. Markdown Rendering:
    Use a library like react-markdown to render markdown content from prompts and outputs.

11. Real-time Updates:
    Consider implementing WebSocket connections (using Socket.io) for real-time updates when new outputs are generated or prompts are moved to "Run" status.

Example Component Structure:
```
src/
  components/
    Agents/
      AgentList.js
      AgentForm.js
      AgentDetail.js
    Prompts/
      PromptList.js
      PromptForm.js
      PromptDetail.js
      PromptRunner.js
    Outputs/
      OutputList.js
      OutputDetail.js
    Common/
      Metadata/
        MetadataForm.js
        MetadataDisplay.js
      RelationshipGraph.js
      MarkdownRenderer.js
  services/
    api.js
  contexts/
    DataContext.js
  pages/
    Dashboard.js
    AgentsPage.js
    PromptsPage.js
    OutputsPage.js
```

This structure allows for a modular, maintainable frontend that can grow with your system's needs. By leveraging React's component-based architecture and MongoDB's flexible document model, you can create a powerful, customizable frontend for your Output Hub system that efficiently manages and displays the complex relationships between your prompts, outputs, and agents.
