*Note: this repository consists of the outputs of large language models (LLMs). In many cases, these are unedited or minimally edited. The information provided is for demonstrative purposes only and is intended to highlight constraints and capabilities in LLM applications and prompt engineering strategies.*


# Prompt

Great. But I'd like to add a revision to the functionality. For the prompt library, I'd like to have a button for running the prompt through the API. I don't think the folder based trigger model is required if we're building a GUI. Can you draft a revised technical spec that reflects this change in the design?

# Output

Certainly! I'll draft a revised technical specification that incorporates a button for running prompts through the API directly from the GUI, removing the folder-based trigger model. Here's the updated spec:

Project Name: Output Hub (Revised)

Objective:
Create a web-based application for managing and organizing LLM (Language Model) prompts and outputs, with direct API integration for running prompts.

Technology Stack:
1. Backend:
   - Database: MongoDB
   - ODM: Mongoose
   - Server: Node.js with Express.js
   - Admin Panel: AdminJS

2. Frontend:
   - AdminJS-generated interface with custom components

3. LLM Integration:
   - API integration with a chosen LLM provider (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic)

Core Features:
1. Agent Management:
   - CRUD operations for custom LLM agents
   - Store agent configurations

2. Prompt Management:
   - CRUD operations for prompts
   - Button to run prompts through LLM API
   - Display prompt status (Draft, Processed)

3. Output Management:
   - Automatic storage of LLM-generated outputs
   - Link outputs to corresponding prompts and agents
   - CRUD operations for manually editing outputs if needed

4. LLM Integration:
   - Send prompts to LLM API directly from the application UI
   - Automatically save received outputs to the database

5. Metadata and Tagging:
   - Add custom metadata to outputs (e.g., programming languages used)
   - Implement a tagging system for easy categorization and retrieval

6. Follow-up Activities:
   - Create and manage follow-up tasks related to specific outputs

7. Relationship Management:
   - Maintain and display relationships between agents, prompts, and outputs

Data Model:
1. Agents Collection
2. Prompts Collection (updated to include status field)
3. Outputs Collection
4. FollowUpActivities Collection

User Interface:
- Admin panel for CRUD operations on all collections
- Custom button in prompt view to trigger LLM processing
- Display of LLM-generated outputs linked to their prompts
- Interface for viewing and managing relationships between entities

Additional Requirements:
1. User Authentication: Implement basic user authentication for accessing the admin panel
2. Data Validation: Use Mongoose schemas for data validation
3. Error Handling: Implement robust error handling for database operations and API calls
4. Asynchronous Processing: Handle LLM API calls asynchronously to prevent UI blocking

Development Approach:
1. Define Mongoose schemas locally and use them to create MongoDB collections
2. Set up AdminJS for basic CRUD operations
3. Implement custom actions in AdminJS for LLM integration
4. Develop custom components for running prompts and displaying outputs
5. Integrate LLM API service
6. Implement error handling and asynchronous processing for API calls

This revised specification removes the folder-based trigger model and instead focuses on a GUI-centric approach where users can run prompts through the LLM API with a button click directly from the admin interface. This change simplifies the user interaction model and provides more immediate feedback to the user when working with prompts and generating outputs.
