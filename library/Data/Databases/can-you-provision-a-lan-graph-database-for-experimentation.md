# Prompt

Let's say that I wanted to play around with Neo4J. I'd like to host a local database on my Ubuntu VM home server for this purpose. If the experiment were successful, I'd like to be able to migrate the data from my local environment up to the cloud, preferably with minimal effort. As a first iteration, I'd like the locally hosted database to be accessible via a Cloudflare tunnel. That's already set up, so i'd just need to configure the endpoint. Please provide a guide for setting this up

# Output

Here’s a step-by-step guide to setting up Neo4j on your Ubuntu VM with Cloudflare Tunnel for secure remote access:

### Step 1: Install Neo4j on Ubuntu

1. **Update Your System**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
   ```

2. **Add Neo4j Repository**:
   - Install necessary packages:
     ```bash
     sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common -y
     ```
   - Add Neo4j's signing key:
     ```bash
     curl -fsSL https://debian.neo4j.com/neotechnology.gpg.key | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/neo4j.gpg
     ```
   - Add the Neo4j APT repository:
     ```bash
     echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/neo4j.gpg] https://debian.neo4j.com stable 4.x" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/neo4j.list
     ```

3. **Install Neo4j**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install neo4j -y
   ```

4. **Start and Enable Neo4j**:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable neo4j
   sudo systemctl start neo4j
   ```

5. **Set the Neo4j Admin Password**:
   - Open the Neo4j console and set your password:
     ```bash
     cypher-shell
     ```
   - Log in with default credentials (`neo4j/neo4j`) and follow the prompt to set a new password.

### Step 2: Configure Neo4j for External Access

1. **Modify Neo4j’s Configuration File**:
   - Open Neo4j’s configuration file:
     ```bash
     sudo nano /etc/neo4j/neo4j.conf
     ```
   - Look for the line:
     ```plaintext
     #dbms.default_listen_address=0.0.0.0
     ```
   - Uncomment this line and change it to `0.0.0.0` to allow Neo4j to listen on all network interfaces:
     ```plaintext
     dbms.default_listen_address=0.0.0.0
     ```
   - Save and close the file.

2. **Restart Neo4j to Apply Changes**:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart neo4j
   ```

### Step 3: Set Up Cloudflare Tunnel for Secure Access

1. **Create a Cloudflare Tunnel** (assuming Cloudflare Tunnel is already installed and configured):
   - Open your Cloudflare Tunnel configuration file (usually `config.yml`):
     ```bash
     nano ~/.cloudflared/config.yml
     ```
   - Add a new service to route traffic to the Neo4j service. Here’s a sample entry:
     ```yaml
     tunnel: YOUR_TUNNEL_ID
     credentials-file: /home/YOUR_USERNAME/.cloudflared/YOUR_TUNNEL_ID.json

     ingress:
       - hostname: neo4j.YOURDOMAIN.com
         service: http://localhost:7474  # Neo4j's default HTTP port
       - hostname: neo4jbolt.YOURDOMAIN.com
         service: tcp://localhost:7687  # Neo4j's default Bolt protocol port
       - service: http_status:404
     ```
   - Replace `YOUR_TUNNEL_ID`, `YOUR_USERNAME`, and `YOURDOMAIN.com` with your actual tunnel ID, username, and domain.

2. **Restart the Cloudflare Tunnel**:
   ```bash
   cloudflared tunnel run YOUR_TUNNEL_NAME
   ```

3. **Verify DNS Configuration**:
   - Ensure your DNS records on Cloudflare match the subdomains (e.g., `neo4j.YOURDOMAIN.com` and `neo4jbolt.YOURDOMAIN.com`) pointing to the tunnel.

### Step 4: Access Neo4j via Cloudflare Tunnel

- **Access the Neo4j Browser**:
  - Visit `https://neo4j.YOURDOMAIN.com` in your browser, which should bring up the Neo4j Browser login.
- **Bolt Connection**:
  - Use the `neo4jbolt.YOURDOMAIN.com` hostname if you need to connect via the Bolt protocol (e.g., for applications connecting directly).

### Step 5: Migrating to a Cloud Environment (Optional for Future)

If the local experiment is successful, you can easily migrate your Neo4j database to a cloud instance:

1. **Export Data**:
   ```bash
   neo4j-admin dump --database=neo4j --to=neo4j_backup.dump
   ```

2. **Transfer and Import Data** on the Cloud Instance:
   - Upload `neo4j_backup.dump` to your cloud server and import it:
     ```bash
     neo4j-admin load --from=neo4j_backup.dump --database=neo4j --force
     ```

This setup allows for secure, remote access to Neo4j via a Cloudflare tunnel, making it accessible both locally and over the internet through your configured domain.
