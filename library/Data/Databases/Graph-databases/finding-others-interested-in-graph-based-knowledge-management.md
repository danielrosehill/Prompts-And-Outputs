# Prompt

Can you suggest some online communities I could connect with to find others who are interested in organising knowledge and particularly in the idea of using graph based approaches for this purpose

# Outputs

Here are some online communities focused on organizing knowledge and graph-based knowledge management:

### 1. **Reddit Communities**
   - **r/KnowledgeManagement**: A community dedicated to all aspects of knowledge management, including tools and techniques.
   - **r/PersonalKnowledgeMgmt**: Focuses on personal knowledge management, with discussions often including graph-based tools.
   - **r/ObsidianMD**: Since Obsidian uses graph views, this community has many users exploring graph-based approaches to note-taking and knowledge organization.
   - **r/roamresearch**: Users of Roam Research frequently discuss graph-based note-taking methods and broader knowledge management topics.

### 2. **Discord Servers and Slack Channels**
   - **Tools for Thought**: A popular Discord server where people discuss various knowledge management tools and approaches, including graph databases.
   - **Obsidian Community** (on Discord): A well-organized space with channels that cover advanced uses of graph-based knowledge.
   - **Roam Cult Slack**: For those interested in Roam Research, this Slack workspace focuses on graph-based knowledge organization and research.

### 3. **The Tools for Thought Community (TfT)**
