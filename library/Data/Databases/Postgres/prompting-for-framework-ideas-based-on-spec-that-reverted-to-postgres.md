# Prompt

Please study the attached technical specification.

Suggest 20 web development frameworks which could be used to build this tool. Order your list like this: start with the project that you think is the best choice and then continue to less ideal solutions.

Do not suggest any low code or no code tools.

Do not suggest any frameworks that do not support Postgres out of the box. 

Try to find frameworks and tools which have a proven track record of speeding up the development of internal tools.

# Output

Based on the technical specification provided for the Output Hub (OH) project, here are 20 web development frameworks that could be used to build this tool, ordered from best choice to less ideal solutions. All of these frameworks support PostgreSQL out of the box and have a proven track record of speeding up the development of internal tools:

1. Django: A high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design[1].

2. Ruby on Rails: A server-side web application framework written in Ruby, known for its convention over configuration approach[1].

3. Express.js with Sequelize ORM: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that can be paired with Sequelize for easy database operations[2][3].

4. NestJS: A progressive Node.js framework for building efficient and scalable server-side applications[3][5].

5. Laravel: A PHP web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax and robust features for rapid development[1].

6. Spring Boot: A Java-based framework that simplifies the development of stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications[1].

7. ASP.NET Core: A cross-platform, high-performance framework for building modern, cloud-based, Internet-connected applications[1].

8. Phoenix: A productive web framework that does not compromise speed or maintainability, built on Elixir[1].

9. FastAPI: A modern, fast (high-performance) Python web framework for building APIs[1].

10. Adonis.js: A Node.js web framework with a strong focus on developer ergonomics, stability, and confidence[3].

11. Symfony: A set of reusable PHP components and a web application framework[1].

12. Grails: A powerful Groovy-based web application framework for the JVM[1].

13. Sails.js: A web framework that makes it easy to build custom, enterprise-grade Node.js apps[3].

14. Flask with SQLAlchemy: A lightweight WSGI web application framework in Python, paired with SQLAlchemy ORM[1].

15. Yii: A fast, secure, and efficient PHP framework[1].

16. Koa.js: A new web framework designed by the team behind Express.js, which aims to be a smaller, more expressive, and more robust foundation for web applications and APIs[3].

17. Feathers: A lightweight web-framework for creating real-time applications and REST APIs using JavaScript or TypeScript[3].

18. Hapi.js: A powerful Node.js framework for building applications and services[3].

19. CakePHP: A rapid development framework for PHP that provides an extensible architecture for developing, maintaining, and deploying applications[1].

20. Meteor: A full-stack JavaScript platform for developing modern web and mobile applications[1].

These frameworks are all capable of handling the requirements specified in the Output Hub project, including CRUD operations, user authentication, and API integration. They also have strong community support and extensive documentation, which can help speed up development.
