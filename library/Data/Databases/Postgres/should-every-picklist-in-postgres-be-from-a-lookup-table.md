Creating unique tables for every "picker" value in a frontend application, especially in PostgreSQL, is generally not recommended unless there's a specific reason that justifies such a design. Here's why:

### **1\. Data Normalization and Redundancy:**

\- **Normalization:** In a well-normalized database, you'd typically have a single table for each type of entity (e.g., `Pickers`) and another table for the possible values (e.g., `PickerValues`). Each "picker" in your frontend would correspond to a row in the `Pickers` table, and the possible values for that picker would be related to it via a foreign key in the `PickerValues` table.

\- **Redundancy:** Creating unique tables for each picker value type can lead to data redundancy, making the database harder to maintain. Changes in one table might need to be replicated across multiple tables, leading to inconsistencies and increased maintenance overhead.

### **2\. Large Number of Tables:**

\- **Schema Management:** Having a large number of tables, especially for something as simple as picker values, can make your database schema complex and difficult to manage. Querying across multiple tables, creating joins, and maintaining the relationships become more challenging as the number of tables increases.

\- **Performance Impact:** PostgreSQL is very efficient at handling a large number of tables, but there are performance considerations when you need to query across many tables. Index maintenance, query planning, and execution could become more complex and slower when dealing with many related tables.

### **3\. Relationships and Performance Constraints:**

\- **Foreign Keys and Indexes:** If you're dealing with many relationships, especially if each picker table has foreign keys pointing to other tables, maintaining these relationships could become costly in terms of performance. Indexes on these foreign keys help, but the overhead increases with the number of tables and relationships.

\- **Query Complexity:** Complex queries involving many joins across multiple tables might suffer from performance degradation, particularly as the data size grows. PostgreSQL is capable of handling complex queries efficiently, but the more joins and relationships you introduce, the more careful you need to be with query optimization.

### **4\. Alternative Approaches:**

\- **Single Table with Type Column:** A more scalable approach is to use a single table for all picker values and differentiate the types of pickers using a `type` or `category` column. This way, you can filter the values based on the type when needed. For example:

\`\`\`sql

CREATE TABLE PickerValues (

id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,

picker\_type VARCHAR(255),

value VARCHAR(255)

);

\`\`\`

\- This design is easier to maintain and allows you to take advantage of PostgreSQL's indexing and querying capabilities more efficiently.

\- **JSONB Column:** If the structure of picker values varies widely, consider using a JSONB column to store the picker data. This provides flexibility while keeping the schema simple. However, JSONB should be used carefully, as it can introduce complexity in querying and indexing.

### **Conclusion:**

Creating unique tables for every picker value can lead to a highly complex and potentially inefficient database design. Instead, using a single table to store all picker values with a type or category column is typically more maintainable and performs better. The large number of relationships in your original design could indeed pose a performance constraint, particularly as your data grows and queries become more complex. Keeping the schema simple and normalized generally leads to better performance and easier maintenance.
