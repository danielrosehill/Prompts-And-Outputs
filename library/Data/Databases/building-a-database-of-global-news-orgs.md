Creating a **comprehensive global database** of news organizations and websites, particularly focused on their **homepage**, **Middle East sections**, and **Israel sections**, is a challenging but achievable task. Here's how you can approach it:

### **1. Existing Databases of News Organizations/Websites**
There are some resources and databases available that catalog news organizations globally, but they may not have exactly the structure you're looking for (i.e., the three specific URLs for each site).

#### **Existing Resources:**
1. **Media Bias/Fact Check (MBFC) Database**:
   - **Description**: MBFC is a popular resource for categorizing and listing news sources worldwide based on their bias and factual reporting.
   - **Data**: Provides links to media outlets globally, but you’d likely need to extract additional information, such as specific sections like the Middle East or Israel.
   - **Availability**: The website provides free access, but scraping might be required for large-scale use. No pre-built exportable database exists that matches your need for specific sections.
   - **Link**: [Media Bias/Fact Check](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/)

2. **Global Database of Public News Organizations (GNI)**:
   - **Description**: The Global Network Initiative has some public databases of press organizations, primarily focusing on media freedom and news outlets.
   - **Data**: Limited in scope, and you might not find the exact sections you're looking for (Middle East, Israel).
   - **Availability**: Free, but not tailored to your specific query.
   - **Link**: [Global Network Initiative](https://globalnetworkinitiative.org/)

3. **Open Data Platforms**:
   - Platforms like **OpenDataSoft** and **Kaggle** might have datasets related to global media organizations, but they are unlikely to include the depth of specific Middle East and Israel sections.
   - **Example**: [Kaggle Datasets on Global Media](https://www.kaggle.com/) — You can search here for media-related datasets.

4. **PressReader**:
   - **Description**: While not a database, PressReader offers access to a wide range of international publications. You might be able to extract publication URLs and details for specific regions.
   - **Link**: [PressReader](https://www.pressreader.com/)

### **Conclusion on Existing Databases**:
No comprehensive **free** database exists that exactly meets your requirement for three specific URLs per news site (homepage, Middle East, Israel). You may have to either subscribe to premium services or build the database yourself.

### **2. Building Your Own Database via Web Scraping**
If you decide to **build this database yourself**, web scraping can help you collect the necessary URLs for each site. Here's how you could go about it.

#### **Steps to Build Your Own Web Scraping Solution**:

#### **Step 1: Define the Structure and Scope of Your Database**
- **Data structure**: Each news organization should have fields for:
  - Name
  - Homepage URL
  - Middle East section URL (if available)
  - Israel section URL (if available)
- **Sources**: Create a list of major global news organizations (this can include scraping from lists like **Wikipedia**, **Media Bias/Fact Check**, or **PressReader**).

#### **Step 2: Choose Your Scraping Tools**
You can use a variety of scraping tools depending on your comfort level with coding:

1. **Python and BeautifulSoup**:
   - BeautifulSoup is a popular Python library for extracting data from HTML and XML files.
   - Combined with **requests**, you can easily build scrapers that extract specific links from a news website.

   Example:

   ```python
   import requests
   from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

   def get_sections(url):
       response = requests.get(url)
       soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
       
       homepage = url
       middle_east_section = None
       israel_section = None
       
       # Find links to Middle East and Israel sections
       for link in soup.find_all('a', href=True):
           if 'middle-east' in link['href'].lower():
               middle_east_section = link['href']
           if 'israel' in link['href'].lower():
               israel_section = link['href']
       
       return {
           'homepage': homepage,
           'middle_east': middle_east_section,
           'israel': israel_section
       }

   # Example for one news website:
   print(get_sections('https://www.bbc.com'))
   ```

   This example scrapes a website’s homepage, then searches for links with "middle-east" and "israel" in their URLs.

2. **Scrapy**:
   - **Scrapy** is a more robust Python framework for large-scale scraping. It’s well-suited if you plan to scale this scraping task for hundreds or thousands of websites.

   Example:
   - Set up a spider that crawls the homepage, locates internal links that mention "Middle East" or "Israel," and then stores them in a structured format.

3. **Selenium** (for JavaScript-heavy websites):
   - If the news sites rely heavily on **JavaScript**, you might need to use **Selenium** (a browser automation tool) to load and scrape dynamic content.

#### **Step 3: Automate the Scraping Process**
You can automate the process by iterating over a list of websites. For each website:
- Extract the **homepage URL**.
- Identify links to the **Middle East** and **Israel** sections (based on keywords in URLs or section headers).

#### **Step 4: Save the Data**
Store the extracted data in a CSV or a database (such as **SQLite**, **PostgreSQL**, or even **Google Sheets**) for easy querying and management.

```python
import csv

data = [
    {'name': 'BBC', 'homepage': 'https://bbc.com', 'middle_east': 'https://bbc.com/news/middle-east', 'israel': 'https://bbc.com/news/israel'},
    # add more rows here
]

# Save to CSV
with open('news_organizations.csv', mode='w', newline='') as file:
    writer = csv.DictWriter(file, fieldnames=['name', 'homepage', 'middle_east', 'israel'])
    writer.writeheader()
    for row in data:
        writer.writerow(row)
```

#### **Step 5: Regular Updates**
News websites frequently change their structure, so you may need to re-scrape the data periodically to keep the URLs up to date.

### **3. Legal and Ethical Considerations in Web Scraping**
Before you start scraping, it’s important to ensure you follow ethical practices:
- **Check the website’s terms of service** to ensure that scraping is allowed. Some websites explicitly forbid scraping.
- Implement **rate limiting** in your scrapers to avoid overwhelming servers.
- Respect **robots.txt** directives, which can guide what parts of a site are off-limits to scrapers.

---

### **Conclusion:**
- **Existing Databases**: There’s no ready-made free database that meets your exact needs, but some resources like **MBFC** or **Wikipedia** can provide a foundation.
- **Building Your Own Database**: Using web scraping with tools like **BeautifulSoup**, **Scrapy**, or **Selenium**, you can construct your own database of news websites, focusing on the specific sections you're interested in.
- **Automation**: Once set up, the process can be automated and regularly updated to ensure the URLs remain current.
