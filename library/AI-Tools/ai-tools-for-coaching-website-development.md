# Prompt

Are there any AI tools that are designed to facilitate conversational interactions in which the LLM actively coaches you through setting up a website / building a project?  
# Output

Based on your query, you're looking for AI tools specifically designed to coach you through setting up a website or building a project, with a focus on conversational interactions. While GitHub Copilot is more focused on code completion, there are indeed tools that aim to provide a more interactive, coaching-like experience for web development and project building. Here are a few options that might fit your needs:

1. Wix ADI (Artificial Design Intelligence):
   While not strictly conversational, Wix ADI asks a series of questions about your website goals and preferences, then uses AI to create a customized website. It guides you through the process in a step-by-step manner, which is similar to a coaching experience.

2. Heights AI:
   This tool is designed specifically for course creators but offers a conversational AI interface to guide users through the process of creating online courses. While not for general web development, it demonstrates the kind of AI-powered coaching experience you're looking for.

3. Coachvox AI:
   Although primarily marketed for creating AI versions of coaches, this platform shows the potential for AI-driven conversational coaching in various domains, including potentially guiding users through project development.

4. Rocky.ai:
   This AI coaching platform, while focused on personal development and leadership skills, showcases the potential for AI-driven conversational coaching. A similar approach could be applied to web development or project management.

While these tools don't exactly match your specific request for a conversational AI coach for web development, they demonstrate that the technology and approach you're looking for is emerging in various fields. It's possible that similar tools specifically for web development and project building may be in development or may emerge soon, given the growing trend of AI-assisted development tools.

For now, you might consider using a combination of tools:
1. A general AI assistant like ChatGPT or Claude for conversational guidance and planning.
2. Specific web development tools or frameworks for the actual building process.
3. AI-powered code assistants like GitHub Copilot for coding help.

This combination could provide a more comprehensive, coaching-like experience for your web development or project building needs.
