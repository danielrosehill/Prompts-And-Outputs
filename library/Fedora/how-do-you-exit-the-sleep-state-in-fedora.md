# Prompt

Can you describe how the sleep mode works in Fedora? I'm using KDE Plasma Workstation 40. Is it basically a suspend state? Can you set up a quick shortcut to put your session into it? And for waking the computer up, can you again config an exit hotkey or if not what's the default way to activate the system?

# Output

Certainly! I'll describe how sleep mode works in Fedora with KDE Plasma Workstation 40 and provide information on setting it up and waking the system.

## Sleep Mode in Fedora KDE Plasma

Sleep mode in Fedora KDE Plasma is essentially a suspend state. When your computer enters sleep mode, it saves the current state of your system to RAM and enters a low-power state[1]. This allows for quick resume times when you wake the computer up.

## Setting Up Sleep Mode

To put your Fedora KDE Plasma system into sleep mode, you have several options:

1. **Application Menu**: You can click on the "Sleep" option in the application menu[1].

2. **Power Button**: By default, pressing the power button briefly should put the system to sleep.

3. **Closing Laptop Lid**: If you're using a laptop, closing the lid typically triggers sleep mode.

## Creating a Sleep Shortcut

You can set up a quick shortcut to put your session into sleep mode:

1. Go to System Settings > Shortcuts
2. Look for the "Power Management" section
3. Find the option for "Suspend" or "Sleep"
4. Assign your desired keyboard shortcut (e.g., Meta+Z)[3]

## Waking Up the Computer

Waking up a Fedora KDE Plasma system from sleep mode typically involves:

1. **Pressing the Power Button**: This is the most common and reliable method[4].

2. **Keyboard or Mouse Input**: Moving the mouse or pressing a key on the keyboard should wake the system, though this may not work in all cases[4].

3. **Opening Laptop Lid**: If you're using a laptop, opening the lid should wake the system.

There isn't a specific "exit hotkey" for waking up from sleep mode, as the system needs to be powered on first to recognize keyboard input.

## Troubleshooting

If you experience issues with sleep mode, such as the system not waking up properly, you may need to:

1. Check for system updates, including BIOS/UEFI updates[4].
2. Adjust power management settings in your BIOS/UEFI[4].
3. Consider using proprietary GPU drivers if you're using the open-source nouveau driver for NVIDIA graphics[4].

Remember that sleep mode behavior can sometimes be affected by hardware compatibility issues, so if you encounter persistent problems, it may be worth checking for known issues with your specific hardware configuration.
