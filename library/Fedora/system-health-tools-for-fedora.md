# Prompt

I use a Fedora workstation computer. Are there any utilities that could conduct weekly health checks on my system (including its drives) and send that data up to a cloud dashboard for me to review? Free/paid tools relevant

# Output

Based on your request for more options and the search results provided, here are a few additional system monitoring tools that could be suitable for your Fedora workstation:

1. Nagios:
Nagios provides comprehensive monitoring for Fedora Linux systems[1]:
- Monitors operating system metrics, service state, process state, and file system usage
- Offers proactive monitoring to reduce downtime and boost efficiency
- Provides both free (Nagios Core) and paid (Nagios XI) versions
- Can be configured to send alerts and reports, potentially meeting your need for a cloud dashboard

2. Glances:
Glances is a versatile system monitoring tool[2]:
- Offers a wide range of information in a single interface
- Can export stats to an external database
- Provides a web interface for remote monitoring
- Free and open-source
- Installation on Fedora: `sudo dnf install glances`

3. bashtop:
A resource monitor that displays usage and stats for processor, memory, disks, network, and processes[2]:
- User-friendly interface with mouse support
- Customizable
- Free and open-source
- Installation on Fedora: `sudo dnf install bashtop`

4. Netdata:
While mentioned in the previous response, it's worth highlighting again as it closely matches your requirements[2]:
- Offers real-time, high-resolution monitoring
- Provides a cloud dashboard for reviewing data
- Has both free and paid tiers
- Easy to install and use
- Installation on Fedora: 
  ```
  bash <(curl -Ss https://my-netdata.io/kickstart.sh)
  ```

5. Zabbix:
Although not mentioned in the search results, Zabbix is another powerful monitoring solution:
- Supports Fedora and can monitor system health
- Offers a web-based interface and can send alerts
- Has both free and enterprise versions
- Can be configured to perform regular health checks

When considering these options, keep in mind:
- Nagios and Zabbix are more complex and might be overkill for a single workstation, but they offer comprehensive monitoring capabilities.
- Glances and bashtop are lighter-weight options that are easier to set up but may not have built-in cloud dashboard features.
- Netdata offers a good balance of features and ease of use, with built-in cloud dashboard functionality.

For your specific need of weekly health checks and a cloud dashboard, you might need to combine one of these tools with a custom script to schedule weekly reports and upload them to a cloud storage service. Alternatively, a tool like Netdata with its cloud features might be the most straightforward solution.
