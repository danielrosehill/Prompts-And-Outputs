Yes, there are several applications available for **Fedora** that can help you estimate how much electricity your computer is using during operation:

### 1. **PowerTOP**
   - **Description**: PowerTOP is a popular tool for Linux systems, designed primarily for optimizing power consumption. It provides detailed information about the system's power usage and suggests tweaks to reduce energy consumption.
   - **Features**:
     - Real-time monitoring of power usage by components (CPU, GPU, devices, etc.).
     - Provides an estimate of the current power consumption (in watts).
   - **Installation**:
     ```bash
     sudo dnf install powertop
     ```
   - **Usage**: Run it in terminal using `sudo powertop`. It will display the power consumption of your system in real-time.

### 2. **GNOME Power Statistics (gnome-power-manager)**
   - **Description**: If you are using a GNOME desktop environment, this tool provides simple power statistics about your device.
   - **Features**:
     - Monitor power consumption over time.
     - View the power usage of various system components.
   - **Installation**:
     ```bash
     sudo dnf install gnome-power-manager
     ```
   - **Usage**: It is typically integrated into the GNOME desktop, providing graphical statistics on power consumption.

### 3. **s-tui (Stress Terminal UI)**
   - **Description**: While primarily used for monitoring CPU temperature and stress testing, s-tui can also give you an overview of system power consumption when used with Intelâ€™s RAPL (Running Average Power Limit) framework.
   - **Features**:
     - Graphical interface in the terminal.
     - CPU power consumption statistics.
   - **Installation**:
     ```bash
     sudo dnf install s-tui
     ```
   - **Usage**: Run `s-tui` in the terminal, and it will show real-time data on CPU usage, power, and temperature.

### 4. **TLP**
   - **Description**: TLP is a command-line tool that helps to optimize and monitor laptop power consumption. While it doesn't display real-time power usage directly, it helps in managing and reducing overall consumption by applying various system tweaks.
   - **Installation**:
     ```bash
     sudo dnf install tlp
     ```

### Combining with External Tools:
If your hardware supports **Intel RAPL** or **AMD PowerCap** technologies, applications like PowerTOP can provide detailed estimates of power usage. You may also need to consult the BIOS/UEFI for additional power data.

These tools should give you a good estimation of your system's power usage while running Fedora.
