# Prompt

I use KDE Plasma + Fedora. I'd like to create a desktop widget that has the local time in Israel and UTC. Can you suggest a way to create this

# Output

You can create a desktop widget in KDE Plasma that displays both the local time in Israel and UTC by following these steps:

### 1. **Use KDE’s Built-in Digital Clock Widget (with Multiple Time Zones)**

KDE Plasma has a **Digital Clock** widget that allows you to display multiple time zones, including Israel (local time) and UTC.

#### Steps:
1. **Add the Digital Clock Widget**:
   - Right-click on your desktop or panel.
   - Select **Add Widgets**.
   - Search for "Digital Clock" and drag it to your desktop or panel.

2. **Configure Multiple Time Zones**:
   - Right-click on the clock widget and select **Configure Digital Clock**.
   - Under the **Time Zones** section:
     - Ensure that your local time (Israel) is already selected.
     - Click the **+ Add** button, search for "UTC", and add it.
   - You will now see both the local time and UTC listed when you hover over the clock.

3. **Customize the Appearance**:
   - In the same **Configure Digital Clock** window, go to **Appearance** and adjust the format (12-hour or 24-hour) and how the time is displayed for better readability.

### 2. **Use a Custom Plasma Widget for Time Zones**
   If you want more control over the widget, you can install additional Plasma widgets from the KDE Store. Here's how to install and configure a more customized time widget:

#### Steps:
1. **Install a Custom Time Zone Widget**:
   - Right-click on the desktop and choose **Add Widgets**.
   - At the bottom of the widget menu, click on **Get New Widgets**.
   - Search for a widget like **Dual Clock** or **World Clock** which allows you to display multiple time zones simultaneously.
   - Install the widget.

2. **Configure the Widget**:
   - Once installed, add the widget to your desktop.
   - Right-click and select **Configure**, where you can add both Israel’s local time zone and UTC.

This approach gives you a fully functional widget that shows both times side by side, which you can customize further according to your preferences.
