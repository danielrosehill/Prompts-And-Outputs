You asked for recommendations on software for working with photos on Fedora, particularly for upscaling to target resolutions for printing. Here are some options:

### 1. **GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program)**
   - **Description**: A powerful open-source alternative to Photoshop, GIMP offers a wide range of photo editing tools. It supports resizing and upscaling images with various interpolation methods.
   - **Features**: 
     - Image resizing with several upscaling algorithms (e.g., cubic, Lanczos).
     - Advanced photo editing tools (color correction, layer support, etc.).
   - **Installation**: 
     ```
     sudo dnf install gimp
     ```

### 2. **ImageMagick**
   - **Description**: A command-line tool that allows for converting, editing, or composing images. It is lightweight and great for batch processing and upscaling.
   - **Features**:
     - Various resizing options for upscaling with high-quality filters (Lanczos, Hermite, etc.).
     - Supports many image formats.
   - **Upscaling Example**:
     ```
     convert input.jpg -resize 3000x4000 output.jpg
     ```
   - **Installation**:
     ```
     sudo dnf install imagemagick
     ```

### 3. **Darktable**
   - **Description**: An open-source photography workflow application and raw developer. Itâ€™s perfect for managing and editing large collections of photos, including resizing and exporting images for printing.
   - **Features**:
     - Non-destructive editing.
     - Upscaling through export options, including pixel-perfect resizing.
     - RAW image processing.
   - **Installation**:
     ```
     sudo dnf install darktable
     ```

### 4. **RawTherapee**
   - **Description**: Another powerful open-source RAW photo editor. It is especially useful for professional photo workflows, including resizing for printing purposes.
   - **Features**:
     - Advanced upscaling options in export settings.
     - Highly customizable image editing tools.
   - **Installation**:
     ```
     sudo dnf install rawtherapee
     ```

### 5. **Upscayl**
   - **Description**: An AI-powered image upscaler that uses machine learning to upscale images while retaining a lot of detail. This could be ideal for enlarging photos specifically for print.
   - **Features**:
     - AI-driven upscaling.
     - Focuses on quality and detail retention during upscaling.
   - **Installation**:
     Download it from [Upscayl's GitHub page](https://github.com/upscayl/upscayl/releases) and follow installation instructions.

### 6. **Krita**
   - **Description**: A professional open-source painting tool that also provides excellent photo editing capabilities. You can use it to upscale images with high-quality interpolation.
   - **Features**:
     - Resizing images with smooth, high-quality algorithms.
     - Full-featured photo and image manipulation tools.
   - **Installation**:
     ```
     sudo dnf install krita
     ```

### Recommended Upscaling Process:
When upscaling images for printing, you can choose between **bilinear**, **bicubic**, or more advanced algorithms like **Lanczos** for the best quality. Some of these tools, like **GIMP** and **ImageMagick**, allow you to choose your preferred algorithm, while **AI-based tools** like **Upscayl** use machine learning for potentially better results.

For a combination of **editing** and **upscaling**, GIMP is highly recommended, but if you're looking for **AI-powered upscaling**, try **Upscayl**.
