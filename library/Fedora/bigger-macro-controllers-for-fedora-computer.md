Here are a few macro controllers with more shortcut keys that have good Linux compatibility, which could work well for your Fedora system. I've included the estimated Recommended Retail Price (RRP) for each option.

### 1. **Elgato Stream Deck XL**
   - **Keys**: 32 customizable LCD keys.
   - **Compatibility**: Stream Deck devices are generally well-supported on Linux using third-party tools like `streamdeck-ui` or `deckmaster`. The XL model provides significantly more keys than the Mini.
   - **RRP**: $249.99

### 2. **X-Keys XK-60**
   - **Keys**: 60 programmable keys.
   - **Compatibility**: X-Keys devices have a strong reputation for Linux support. Their software, `xkeys` and related APIs, offer good flexibility for creating custom shortcuts and macros.
   - **RRP**: $229.95

### 3. **X-Keys XK-24**
   - **Keys**: 24 programmable keys.
   - **Compatibility**: Like the XK-60, the XK-24 is well-supported on Linux. This smaller version offers fewer keys but is still a solid option for expanding your macro key setup.
   - **RRP**: $149.95

### 4. **ShuttlePRO v2**
   - **Keys**: 15 programmable buttons, along with a jog dial and shuttle ring.
   - **Compatibility**: Works with Linux using third-party tools and scripts. The buttons are often used in video editing setups, but it’s versatile enough for macro control.
   - **RRP**: $109.95

### 5. **Behringer X-Touch Mini**
   - **Keys**: 8 rotary encoders with LED rings, 16 programmable buttons.
   - **Compatibility**: Primarily used for audio and MIDI, but it can also be repurposed for general macro control in Linux. There are tools available for configuring it in Linux environments.
   - **RRP**: $79.99

### 6. **QMK-Compatible Keyboards (Custom Macro Pads)**
   - **Keys**: Highly customizable (depends on the specific board you choose).
   - **Compatibility**: QMK firmware (Quantum Mechanical Keyboard) is highly compatible with Linux, and you can program macros at a firmware level. These can be built or bought pre-assembled with different numbers of keys.
   - **RRP**: Varies, typically between $50–$200 depending on size and features.

### 7. **ErgoDox EZ**
   - **Keys**: 32 programmable keys (plus standard keyboard keys).
   - **Compatibility**: Compatible with Linux via QMK firmware. The ErgoDox EZ offers extensive macro programming options, especially for those who want to combine ergonomic typing with macros.
   - **RRP**: $325

These options should give you a range of controllers with varying numbers of keys and features, depending on your needs. If you’re looking for Linux-friendly, the X-Keys line and QMK-compatible devices provide extensive customization with strong support.
