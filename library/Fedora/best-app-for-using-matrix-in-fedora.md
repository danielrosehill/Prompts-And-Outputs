The app I previously mentioned for using **Matrix** is called **Element**.

### **Element (formerly Riot.im)**
- **Platform**: Available on **Android**, **iOS**, **Windows**, **macOS**, and **Linux**.
- **Features**:
  - Element is the **official client** for Matrix, providing a clean and intuitive interface.
  - It supports **end-to-end encryption**, **voice and video calls**, **file sharing**, and **group chats**.
  - It has a **web version** as well, making it accessible from any device with a browser.
- **Integration**: You can also use it for collaboration and it integrates with various services, making it a versatile option if you’re interested in staying connected to different groups, such as the **KDE community**.

If you’re looking for a robust way to use Matrix, **Element** is one of the best and most feature-rich apps for it.


Yes, **Element** is fully compatible with **Fedora**. You have several options for using it on Fedora:

### **1. Install Element on Fedora**
- **Flatpak**: You can easily install Element via **Flatpak**, which is a great option if you're on Fedora, as it ensures the app stays up to date.
  ```bash
  flatpak install flathub im.riot.Riot
  ```
  - This will give you the latest version available on **Flathub**, and Flatpak makes it easy to manage dependencies.

- **RPM Package**: Element doesn’t provide an official **RPM package** for Fedora, but you can also build it from source if you prefer a more direct installation.

- **Web App**: You can use Element via their **web interface** (https://app.element.io/). You can make it more convenient by installing it as a **Progressive Web App (PWA)** in your browser, which works well in Fedora.

### **2. Alternatives to Element for Matrix on Fedora**
If for some reason you don’t want to use Element, there are a few other good options for Matrix clients on Fedora:

- **Fractal**:
  - **Platform**: **GNOME-native** Matrix client.
  - **Features**: Offers a simple and clean UI. It’s not as feature-rich as Element (e.g., lacks voice/video calling), but it is more lightweight.
  - **Installation**: Available in Fedora repositories, and you can install it via DNF:
    ```bash
    sudo dnf install fractal
    ```

- **SchildiChat** (Desktop version):
  - **Platform**: This is a fork of Element but with a **more traditional chat interface**. It’s preferred by users who like a more familiar messaging layout.
  - **Features**: It has most of Element’s core functionality, including encryption, but is more streamlined.
  - **Installation**: You can use Flatpak or build from source.

- **Quaternion**:
  - **Platform**: A **Qt-based Matrix client** that is relatively lightweight.
  - **Features**: It doesn’t have all the multimedia features of Element, but it’s a good, responsive client for basic chat.
  - **Installation**: Available through **Flatpak** or can be built from source. It’s a good option if you prefer a **Qt** application that fits well with KDE Plasma.

### **Recommendation**
For the best **all-round Matrix experience** on Fedora, I recommend sticking with **Element**:
- It’s **full-featured**, actively developed, and integrates well with Matrix features such as **end-to-end encryption** and **group calls**.
- You can either use **Flatpak** to install it or go for the **web app** version for convenience.

If you prefer something lighter and more integrated into **KDE Plasma**, **Quaternion** might be a good alternative. It’s a simpler client but still covers basic messaging needs effectively.

Let me know if you need help installing Element or if you want more detailed guidance on other Matrix clients!
