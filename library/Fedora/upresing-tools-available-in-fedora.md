# Prompt

I'd like to print an A4 landscape print from a photo that's 1754 x 1240px. What resolution should I try to upscale to? And what tools are available for Fedora Linux that might be able to do some upscaling without worsening the quality?

# Output
To upscale a photo with a resolution of **1754 x 1240 pixels** for an **A4 landscape print** (which is about **3508 x 2480 pixels at 300 DPI**), you'll want to increase the resolution to minimize any noticeable loss in quality during printing.

### 1. **Target Resolution**:
   - For a **high-quality A4 print** at 300 DPI, you should aim for around **3508 x 2480 pixels**. This would give you a print with sharp details.
   - Upscaling from **1754 x 1240** to **3508 x 2480** means doubling the resolution. However, keep in mind that significant upscaling can sometimes lead to a softer image if not handled correctly.

### 2. **Tools for Upscaling on Fedora Linux**:

Here are some tools available on Fedora Linux for image upscaling with good quality preservation:

#### 1. **GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program)**:
   - **GIMP** is a powerful open-source tool that includes scaling algorithms to minimize quality loss when upscaling.
   - **Steps**:
     - Open the image in GIMP.
     - Go to `Image > Scale Image`.
     - Input the desired width (3508px) and height (2480px) and set the resolution to 300 DPI.
     - Choose the **Cubic** or **Sinc (Lanczos3)** interpolation method for better quality results.
   - **Why GIMP?**: It offers high control over the upscaling process with advanced interpolation methods.

#### 2. **ImageMagick**:
   - **ImageMagick** is a command-line tool that can be used to upscale images with good control over the quality.
   - **Command**:
     ```
     convert input.jpg -resize 3508x2480 -density 300 -interpolate Bicubic output.jpg
     ```
     - You can experiment with different interpolation methods (`Bicubic`, `Mitchell`, or `Lanczos`) to achieve the best result.
   - **Why ImageMagick?**: It's great for batch processing and efficient upscaling.

#### 3. **waifu2x** (Deep Learning-Based Upscaling):
   - **waifu2x** is a deep learning-based image upscaler originally designed for anime-style images but works well with photos.
   - It can upscale images by **2x or more** while reducing noise and minimizing artifacts.
   - **Installation on Fedora**:
     - You can install it via `waifu2x-converter-cpp` for fast upscaling.
     - Run the command to upscale:
       ```
       waifu2x-converter-cpp -i input.jpg -o output.jpg -s 2
       ```
   - **Why waifu2x?**: It uses AI-based algorithms to upscale with minimal loss of quality, though itâ€™s more suitable for simple images and works better when upscaling by factors of 2.

#### 4. **Upscayl** (AI-Powered Upscaling):
   - **Upscayl** is a dedicated AI image upscaler tool that provides high-quality upscaling for photos and other images.
   - **Installation**: You can download the **AppImage** for Upscayl on Fedora.
   - It provides **AI-powered upscaling** and is designed to handle large resolution jumps with minimal quality loss.
   - **Why Upscayl?**: Best for retaining photo details during large upscales, making it suitable for printing high-resolution images.

### 3. **Recommended Method**:
   - For **fine control** and good results, start with **GIMP** or **ImageMagick** using the **Lanczos3** or **Bicubic interpolation** method.
   - If you want **AI-powered upscaling** for the best possible results, try **Upscayl** or **waifu2x**, especially if you're okay with a **2x upscale** and then further adjusting the size if needed.
