After installing Monit on Fedora, there are several configuration steps you need to complete to set it up properly. Here is a brief overview of what you need to do:

1. **Edit the Configuration File**: The main configuration file for Monit is located at `/etc/monitrc` or `/etc/monit/monitrc`, depending on your system. You need to edit this file to configure Monit's behavior, such as setting up monitoring rules for specific services and enabling the web interface[1][3].

2. **Enable the Web Interface (Optional)**: If you want to use Monit's web interface, you'll need to configure it in the configuration file. Uncomment and modify the lines related to the HTTP server settings, such as `set httpd port 2812`, and specify the IP addresses allowed to access it[1][4].

3. **Define Monitoring Rules**: Add specific configurations for each service or process you want Monit to monitor. This involves specifying the process ID file, start and stop commands, and conditions under which Monit should restart a service[2][3].

4. **Check Configuration Syntax**: Before starting Monit, ensure that your configuration file has no syntax errors by running `monit -t`. This command will validate the configuration file[1][4].

5. **Start and Enable Monit**: Start the Monit service using `systemctl start monit` and enable it to start automatically at boot with `systemctl enable monit`[2][3].

6. **Access the Web Interface**: If configured, you can access Monit's web interface by navigating to `http://your-server-ip:2812` in a web browser[1][4].

By following these steps, you'll have Monit set up and ready to monitor processes on your Fedora system effectively.
