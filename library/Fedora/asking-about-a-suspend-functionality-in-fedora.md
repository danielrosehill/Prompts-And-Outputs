# Prompt

Is there a tool for Fedora Linux that can allow you to store your current session but put the computer into a low power state? If so, what's it called and is there any GUI for making sure that the process works smoothly?

# Output

Fedora Linux provides a feature called "suspend" or "sleep" that allows you to store your current session while putting the computer into a low-power state. This functionality is built into the system and can be accessed through both the command line and the graphical user interface.

## Suspend/Sleep Feature

Suspend, also known as sleep, is a power-saving state where your system's current running state is saved directly to RAM. The system remains in a low-power state until awakened by an event such as pressing the power button, opening the laptop lid, or moving the mouse[1].

### Command Line Method

To suspend your Fedora system from the command line, you can use the following command:

```
systemctl suspend
```

If you need to override suspend inhibitors (e.g., when users are logged in), you can use:

```
systemctl suspend -i
```

### Graphical User Interface

The sleep mode can also be accessed from within the GNOME GUI under the power options[1]. Here's how to access and configure it:

1. Open the Settings application
2. Navigate to the "Power" section
3. Look for options related to "Automatic Suspend" or "Power Saving"

## Ensuring Smooth Operation

To ensure the suspend process works smoothly:

1. **Check suspend support**: Verify that your hardware supports suspend properly. Most modern systems do, but some may have issues.

2. **Update your system**: Keep your Fedora system and drivers up to date to ensure the best compatibility and performance.

3. **Configure power settings**: Use the GNOME Settings app to configure when your system should automatically suspend. This can help save power when the system is idle.

4. **Test suspend functionality**: Before relying on suspend for important work, test it to ensure your system resumes correctly.

5. **Monitor for issues**: If you experience problems with suspend, check system logs for any error messages that might indicate the cause.

## Additional Considerations

- Suspend is different from hibernation. In suspend, the system state is saved to RAM and requires some power to maintain. Hibernation saves the state to disk and allows for a complete power-off, but it's not enabled by default in Fedora[3].

- The system may not go into a suspended state while users are logged in, unless you use the `-i` option with the command line method[1].

- Other actions can also trigger sleep mode, such as closing a laptop lid, pressing the power button briefly, or leaving the computer idle for a set amount of time[1].

By using the suspend feature, you can quickly save your current session and put your Fedora system into a low-power state, allowing for fast resume times when you need to use your computer again.
