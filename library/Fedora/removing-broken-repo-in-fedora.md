# Prompt

I'm working on sharing some of my GPT outputs on Github. I had the idea today that it would be good to set up a separate Obsidian vault so that I can create markdown docs more easily. However, I naturally want to be careful about the info that I put in the public domain. Is it safe to share the .obsidian folder publicly? How should I manage the repo to make sure that private data doesn't accidentally get committeed?

# Output

To safely share your Obsidian vault on GitHub while ensuring no private data is accidentally committed, here are some recommendations for managing your repository and handling the **.obsidian folder**:

### 1. **The .obsidian Folder: Should You Share It?**
   - The **`.obsidian`** folder contains settings for your vault, such as **plugins**, **themes**, and **workspace configurations**. Generally, it's safe to share the **`.obsidian` folder** if you’re not using any plugins that store sensitive information (e.g., password managers or personal data).
   - However, it’s important to **inspect** the folder for any configurations or files that could leak private info, such as **custom scripts**, **API keys**, or settings pointing to sensitive directories.

### 2. **Add Sensitive Files to `.gitignore`**
   - Use a **`.gitignore`** file to ensure sensitive data is not tracked or committed to the Git repository.
   - Here’s a recommended **`.gitignore`** for Obsidian:

     ```bash
     .obsidian/workspace.json
     .obsidian/plugins/your-private-plugin-folder/*
     .obsidian/themes/private-theme/*
     .DS_Store
     Thumbs.db
     ```
   - This setup ignores files like **workspace.json**, which stores your layout and open notes (might contain filenames or private folder references), and any specific plugin/theme directories that could have sensitive settings.

### 3. **Audit Your Files Before Committing**
   - Before committing, perform an audit of the content. Tools like **`git status`** and **`git diff`** help you check exactly what’s being staged.
   - You can also use **pre-commit hooks** that run automated checks to ensure that sensitive information (like personal identifiers or API keys) is not accidentally committed.

### 4. **Manage Repository Visibility**
   - If you're not confident that all sensitive information has been excluded, consider keeping the repository **private** until you’ve fully reviewed its contents.

### 5. **Separate Public and Private Content**
   - Since you’re sharing GPT outputs on GitHub, you might want to keep public and private content separated:
     - **Create a separate vault** for content intended for public sharing, so there’s a clear distinction between your personal notes and the content you’re comfortable putting in the public domain.
     - Alternatively, use **multiple branches** where you keep private data in a branch not shared publicly, and the public content is in the main branch.

### 6. **Use Git Encryption Tools**
   - If you need to store sensitive information in a repository (e.g., local configurations), you can use tools like **git-crypt** or **BlackBox** to encrypt specific files within the repository.

By managing your `.gitignore` carefully, auditing commits, and keeping sensitive information separate, you can safely use Obsidian to share GPT outputs on GitHub. Let me know if you need help with setting up any specific tools or configurations!
