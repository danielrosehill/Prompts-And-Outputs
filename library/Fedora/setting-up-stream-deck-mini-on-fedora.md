# Prompt

I own a Stream Deck mini. I'd like to begin using it with my Fedora Linux computer. Can you suggest any drivers? I'm also looking for things to do with it but I already have some ideas.

I would like to have a button which opens up a new window of ChatGPT (it's a Chrome app and I can provide the shortcut). I'd like another button to do a "add all, commit, push" in VS Code to Github. Explain how I can set these up

### Drivers for Stream Deck Mini on Fedora Linux

1. **Stream Deck Software Alternatives**: Unfortunately, Elgato does not provide native support for Linux, including Fedora. However, you can use third-party applications such as:
   - **streamdeck-ui**: This is a community-developed software that allows you to use Stream Deck on Linux. You can find it on [GitHub](https://github.com/floweisshardt/streamdeck-ui).
   - **Decky**: Another community project designed for Linux users, which you can also find on GitHub.

2. **Installation Steps**:
   - Ensure you have `git` installed. If not, you can install it via the terminal:
     ```bash
     sudo dnf install git
     ```
   - Clone the repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/floweisshardt/streamdeck-ui.git
     ```
   - Follow the installation instructions provided in the repository.

### Setting Up Buttons on Your Stream Deck Mini

Here’s how to set up the two buttons you mentioned:

#### 1. Button to Open a New Window of ChatGPT

- **Create a New Action**:
  - In your Stream Deck software (e.g., streamdeck-ui), create a new button and set it as a **"Website"** or **"Open"** action, depending on the software you're using.

- **Enter the Shortcut**:
  - Use the URL for the ChatGPT app or the shortcut link to open it in Chrome. For example:
    ```
    https://chat.openai.com
    ```
  - You can also use a command to open the Chrome app directly, such as:
    ```bash
    google-chrome --new-window "https://chat.openai.com"
    ```

- **Set the Icon and Name**: Customize the button's appearance by setting an icon and a label (e.g., "ChatGPT").

#### 2. Button for "Add All, Commit, Push" in VS Code to GitHub

- **Create a New Action**:
  - Create another button for executing commands in the terminal. Set it as a **"Multi Action"** or **"Shell Command"**, depending on your Stream Deck software.

- **Enter the Commands**:
  - You can enter the following commands to perform the Git operations. Ensure that your terminal is set to open in the directory of your Git project:
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Your commit message here"
    git push
    ```

- **Script Setup**: Alternatively, you can create a shell script (e.g., `git_push.sh`) that contains:
    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Your commit message here"
    git push
    ```
  - Make the script executable:
    ```bash
    chmod +x /path/to/git_push.sh
    ```

- **Set Button Action**:
  - In your Stream Deck software, set the button action to execute the script:
    ```bash
    /path/to/git_push.sh
    ```

- **Set the Icon and Name**: Customize the button's appearance with an icon and a label (e.g., "Git Push").

### Summary
By using either streamdeck-ui or Decky, you can set up your Stream Deck Mini on your Fedora Linux computer. The buttons can open ChatGPT and execute Git commands in VS Code with a few simple steps. If you need more ideas or further assistance, feel free to ask!

# Prompt

Which of the Github projects have the most users? Do any of them provide the ability to use a GUI?

# Output

Among the available GitHub projects for using the Elgato Stream Deck on Linux, here are some of the most popular ones along with their key features:

1. **StreamController**:
   - **Stars**: 228
   - This project provides an elegant Linux application with support for plugins and automatic page switching based on the active window. It includes features like customizable wallpapers, a screensaver mode, and the ability to control brightness【22†source】. 

2. **streamdeck-linux-gui**:
   - **Stars**: 46
   - This is a fork of an earlier project and includes features for connecting multiple Stream Decks, controlling brightness, and a user interface that allows for drag-and-drop configuration of buttons【19†source】【23†source】. 

3. **streamdeck-ui**:
   - **Stars**: 46
   - Similar to the previous option, this project supports multiple device configurations and offers a range of customizable settings for button displays and actions【20†source】.

4. **StreamDeck UI (forks)**:
   - Some forks of the original `streamdeck_ui` project have emerged, aiming to keep the project alive with new features and improvements【21†source】.

### GUI Availability
Both **StreamController** and **streamdeck-linux-gui** offer a graphical user interface (GUI) that makes it easier to configure and use the Stream Deck. They allow for customizable button actions, multi-device support, and a user-friendly setup process. The GUI features of these projects enable you to easily assign actions and manage configurations without needing to delve into command-line setups【19†source】【22†source】【23†source】.

If you're looking to get started with any of these projects, I recommend trying **StreamController** first due to its active development and robust feature set. It has the most user-friendly interface and additional features like plugin support that enhance functionality.
