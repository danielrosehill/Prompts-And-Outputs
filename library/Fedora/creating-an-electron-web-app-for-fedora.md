When creating an Electron app on Fedora for your own web app, the choice of the underlying browser engine is important for performance, security, and open-source compatibility. Electron uses **Chromium** as its default browser engine, which is a popular choice because of its robustness and widespread support for modern web standards. However, if you're looking for alternatives that are more open-source-friendly, there are a few options worth considering.

### 1. **Chromium (Default for Electron)**
   - **What it is**: Chromium is the open-source project that serves as the foundation for Google Chrome. It’s fully open-source and has fewer proprietary components than Chrome, making it a viable option for developers concerned about open-source purity.
   - **Why use it**: It’s the default for Electron, highly compatible with web standards, and regularly updated. Even though Electron bundles Chromium, it's open-source and free from Google's proprietary code, making it a solid choice for open-source projects.
   
   You don’t need to install Chromium separately, as Electron packages its own version, but you can install Chromium for development and testing purposes.

   To install Chromium on Fedora:
   ```bash
   sudo dnf install chromium
   ```

### 2. **WebKitGTK**
   - **What it is**: WebKitGTK is the GTK+ port of the WebKit engine, used by browsers like Epiphany (GNOME Web). WebKit is a well-established, fully open-source web rendering engine that’s used in a number of browsers, including Safari on macOS.
   - **Why use it**: If you're looking for a highly open-source alternative, WebKitGTK is a good option. It’s less resource-intensive than Chromium and is often favored by those who want a more lightweight and fully open-source engine.
   
   However, WebKit is not natively supported in Electron, so you would need to use a framework like **Nativefier** (which still uses Electron under the hood but can be configured for WebKit rendering via WebKitGTK).

   To install WebKitGTK on Fedora:
   ```bash
   sudo dnf install webkit2gtk3
   ```

### 3. **Firefox (Gecko Engine)**
   - **What it is**: Firefox uses the **Gecko engine**, which is also open-source and developed by the Mozilla Foundation. Firefox’s engine is highly customizable and secure, but it's not directly supported by Electron.
   - **Why use it**: If you prefer Firefox's engine for open-source reasons, you could use frameworks like **Geckodriver** or **Electron alternatives** like **Firejail** to sandbox your Firefox-based app. However, Electron is Chromium-based, so using Firefox would require moving away from Electron entirely or creating a hybrid environment.

   There isn’t an easy drop-in solution to use Gecko in Electron, but if you're interested in using Firefox's engine, consider alternatives to Electron that support Gecko.

### 4. **QtWebEngine (Based on Chromium)**
   - **What it is**: **QtWebEngine** is a browser engine based on Chromium, but specifically designed for the Qt framework. It's used in projects like the Falkon browser and offers a more Qt-native approach than raw Chromium.
   - **Why use it**: If your project is Qt-based or you’re looking for a Qt-friendly browser engine, QtWebEngine is a good alternative. However, it’s still based on Chromium, so it doesn’t entirely move away from that ecosystem.
   
   To install QtWebEngine on Fedora:
   ```bash
   sudo dnf install qt5-qtwebengine
   ```

### Alternative Electron-like Frameworks
If you're open to alternatives to Electron, there are other frameworks that use different engines:

- **Tauri**: This is a highly open-source and lightweight alternative to Electron. It uses the system's native WebView (which is WebKitGTK on Linux) instead of bundling Chromium. Tauri also has a much smaller binary size, making it ideal for those looking for a more lightweight solution.
  
  - Tauri is especially recommended if you want to avoid Chromium entirely.

- **NW.js**: Another alternative to Electron, which also uses Chromium by default but allows more flexibility in how the web engine is managed.

### Summary
- **Chromium** (the open-source base of Google Chrome) is the default and most compatible option with Electron, and since it’s open-source, it's usually considered a good choice.
- If you want something completely different, **WebKitGTK** is an option but may require moving away from Electron or using a wrapper.
- For a lighter-weight, open-source alternative, consider **Tauri**, which uses the system's native WebView, avoiding Chromium altogether.
