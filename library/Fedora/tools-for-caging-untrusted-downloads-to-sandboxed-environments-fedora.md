Yes, on Fedora, you can use tools like **Firejail** and **Flatpak** to isolate downloads or run applications in a sandboxed environment, effectively protecting your system from potential harm.

### 1. **Firejail**
   - **Description**: Firejail is a security sandbox program that restricts the runtime environment of untrusted applications. You can use it to isolate your web browser or download managers so that downloaded files are sandboxed, preventing any malicious content from affecting the rest of your system.
   - **Features**:
     - Sandboxes network access, file system access, and processes.
     - Easy to use with predefined profiles for various applications.
     - Allows you to create custom profiles for specific applications or downloads.
   - **Installation**:
     ```bash
     sudo dnf install firejail
     ```
   - **Usage**:
     To run a browser or download manager inside a Firejail sandbox, use:
     ```bash
     firejail firefox
     ```
     or any other application like `firejail wget`.

### 2. **Flatpak (and Flathub)**:
   - **Description**: **Flatpak** is a system for managing and running sandboxed desktop applications. Flatpak applications are isolated from the host system, only able to access specific resources such as user files and network access.
   - **Features**:
     - Sandboxed environment for each app.
     - Only gives apps access to resources they explicitly need.
     - Widely available and easy to use.
   - **Installation**:
     If Flatpak isn’t installed, you can install it with:
     ```bash
     sudo dnf install flatpak
     ```
   - **Usage**:
     You can install applications (such as browsers) via Flatpak from Flathub (a repository for Flatpak apps), which will automatically be sandboxed:
     ```bash
     flatpak install flathub org.mozilla.firefox
     ```
   Any download made through this instance of Firefox will be sandboxed from the rest of your system.

### 3. **Toolbox (for Fedora Silverblue)**
   - **Description**: **Toolbox** is a containerized environment specifically designed for Fedora Silverblue, but can be used on regular Fedora systems as well. It allows you to run isolated containers where you can perform potentially unsafe tasks, including downloading files.
   - **Features**:
     - Lightweight, containerized environment.
     - Useful for isolating downloads, builds, or untrusted code.
   - **Installation**:
     ```bash
     sudo dnf install toolbox
     ```
   - **Usage**:
     Create and enter a toolbox container:
     ```bash
     toolbox create
     toolbox enter
     ```
     Inside the container, you can download files without impacting your main system.

### 4. **Bubblewrap**
   - **Description**: **Bubblewrap** is a low-level tool for creating unprivileged sandboxes. It’s the foundation for Flatpak but can also be used directly to sandbox individual tasks such as downloads.
   - **Features**:
     - Minimal isolation of processes.
     - Can sandbox single commands or scripts.
   - **Installation**:
     ```bash
     sudo dnf install bubblewrap
     ```
   - **Usage**:
     You can use Bubblewrap to sandbox a download command:
     ```bash
     bwrap --ro-bind / / --tmpfs /tmp wget http://example.com/file
     ```
     This will isolate the download command from your main system.

Using these tools, you can securely download and manage files while keeping your system safe from potential risks.
