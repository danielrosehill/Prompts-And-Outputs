Thanks for the clarification! Since Cloudflare issues certificates in **PEM format**, there's no need to convert them unless you're dealing with specific applications or scenarios that require different formats, like **PKCS#12 (.p12)**. However, in most cases, **PEM** format is sufficient and widely supported, especially on Linux systems like Fedora.

### Here's an updated guide to handle **PEM format certificates** on Fedora.

### 1. **Save the Certificate and Key as Files**

First, save the **certificate** and **private key** to individual files. For example:
- **Certificate** (from Cloudflare): Save this as `client_cert.pem`.
- **Private Key**: Save this as `client_key.pem`.

Ensure that both files contain the appropriate `-----BEGIN` and `-----END` headers.

### 2. **Use PEM Format Directly (If Supported)**

Many applications, including browsers like **Firefox** and **Chrome**, as well as **NetworkManager** and other Linux utilities, can use the PEM format directly without conversion. Here's how to use them.

#### **For Browsers** (Firefox/Chrome):

If you're mainly using the certificate for client authentication (e.g., accessing Cloudflare Access-protected resources) via your browser, you can import the **PEM** file(s) directly in **Firefox** or **Chrome**:

#### **Firefox**:
1. Open Firefox.
2. Go to **Settings** > **Privacy & Security**.
3. Scroll down to the **Certificates** section.
4. Click **View Certificates**.
5. Under the **Your Certificates** tab, click **Import**.
6. When importing, Firefox will ask for a **PKCS#12** file. To use PEM files, you'll need to **combine the certificate and private key into a `.p12` file** (see below) or import them directly into specific applications.

#### **Chrome**:
1. Open Chrome.
2. Go to **Settings** > **Privacy and Security** > **Security**.
3. Scroll down and click **Manage Certificates**.
4. Under the **Your Certificates** tab, click **Import**.
5. Again, Chrome expects a **.p12** file, so if you prefer to keep the **PEM** files, you'll need to combine them into a **.p12**.

**For system-wide services** that require certificates (e.g., **NetworkManager** for VPN connections), the **PEM format** can often be used directly.

### 3. **Combining Certificate and Key into a PKCS#12 (.p12) File** (If Needed)

If a particular application or browser (like **Firefox** or **Chrome**) requires a **.p12** file instead of individual PEM files, you can easily convert your **PEM** certificate and key into a **.p12** file using `openssl`.

#### **Steps to Convert PEM to PKCS#12**:
Run this command to combine the **certificate** and **private key** into a `.p12` file:

```bash
openssl pkcs12 -export -out client_cert.p12 -inkey client_key.pem -in client_cert.pem
```

- **`client_key.pem`**: The private key file.
- **`client_cert.pem`**: The certificate file.
- **`client_cert.p12`**: The output PKCS#12 file that contains both the certificate and the key.

You will be prompted to enter a **password** to protect the `.p12` file, which will be required when importing it into browsers or other services.

### 4. **System-Wide Installation (Optional)**

If you want to make the certificate available **system-wide** (for all applications and services), you can install the **PEM certificate** in the system's trusted certificate store.

#### **Steps**:
1. Copy the **PEM certificate** (and key, if needed) into the trusted anchors directory:
   ```bash
   sudo cp client_cert.pem /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/
   ```

2. Update the systemâ€™s certificate store:
   ```bash
   sudo update-ca-trust
   ```

This makes the certificate available to any service or application that relies on the system's certificate store.

### 5. **Configuring NetworkManager or VPN** (If Needed)

If you're using a VPN or other service that requires a client certificate, you can configure **NetworkManager** directly to use the **PEM format** files.

#### **Steps**:
1. Open **NetworkManager**.
2. Select the connection (e.g., VPN or Wi-Fi) that requires a certificate.
3. In the **Security** or **Authentication** section, specify the **PEM** files:
   - Point the **client certificate** field to `client_cert.pem`.
   - Point the **private key** field to `client_key.pem`.
4. Save the changes and reconnect.

### Conclusion

You can use the **PEM format** directly for most Linux applications and services. If you're working with browsers like **Firefox** or **Chrome**, which expect **.p12** files for client certificates, you may need to convert the **PEM** files into a **PKCS#12** bundle using `openssl`. However, for system-wide services, using **PEM** format should work just fine without conversion.
