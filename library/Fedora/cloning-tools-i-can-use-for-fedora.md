To summarize: you're asking for tools that can be used to take a **full disk clone** of your Fedora Linux system.

There are several tools available for **disk cloning** in Fedora Linux, ranging from command-line utilities to more user-friendly graphical tools. These tools can help you create exact copies of your disk for backup, migration, or recovery purposes.

### Disk Cloning Tools for Fedora Linux:

#### 1. **Clonezilla**
   - **Description**: Clonezilla is a powerful open-source cloning tool that can be used to clone full disks or individual partitions. It works by copying the used blocks, making it efficient in terms of speed and storage.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Supports cloning from and to multiple file systems (ext4, NTFS, FAT32, etc.).
     - Can clone disks or partitions to local drives or over the network.
     - Allows compression to save storage space.
   - **Installation**: Clonezilla is typically used as a **live bootable USB**.
     - Download the ISO: [clonezilla.org](https://clonezilla.org/)
     - Use a tool like **`dd`** or **Etcher** to create a bootable USB drive.
   - **Usage**: Boot from the USB to use Clonezilla's graphical menu.

#### 2. **dd (Data Duplicator)**
   - **Description**: `dd` is a command-line utility built into Linux for copying and converting files, and it can be used to clone entire disks byte-for-byte.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Low-level disk cloning (clones everything, including partitions and file systems).
     - Highly configurable (you can choose block sizes, compression, etc.).
     - Can be combined with **`pv`** (Pipe Viewer) to monitor progress.
   - **Usage**:
     ```bash
     sudo dd if=/dev/sdX of=/dev/sdY bs=64M status=progress
     ```
     - `if=/dev/sdX`: Source drive.
     - `of=/dev/sdY`: Target drive.
     - `bs=64M`: Block size for faster copying.
     - `status=progress`: Shows progress of the operation.
   - **Pros**: Simple and fast for direct cloning.

#### 3. **FSArchiver**
   - **Description**: FSArchiver is an advanced system archiver and cloning tool that allows you to save the contents of file systems into compressed archives. You can also restore these archives onto different partitions or disks.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Supports saving/restoring multiple file systems in a single archive.
     - File-based (does not clone empty space, making it efficient).
     - Cross-platform and supports multiple file systems.
   - **Installation**:
     ```bash
     sudo dnf install fsarchiver
     ```
   - **Usage**:
     ```bash
     sudo fsarchiver savefs /path/to/archive.fsa /dev/sdX
     sudo fsarchiver restfs /path/to/archive.fsa id=0,dest=/dev/sdY
     ```
   - **Pros**: Efficient for cloning used space only, supports different filesystems.

#### 4. **Partclone**
   - **Description**: Partclone is a utility similar to Clonezilla (it’s actually the underlying tool Clonezilla uses). It can be used to clone and restore partitions and supports many file systems.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Block-level disk cloning.
     - Supports compression and various file systems (ext4, btrfs, NTFS, etc.).
     - Suitable for backups or disk migrations.
   - **Installation**:
     ```bash
     sudo dnf install partclone
     ```
   - **Usage**:
     To clone a partition:
     ```bash
     sudo partclone.ext4 -c -s /dev/sdX1 -o /path/to/backup.img
     ```
     To restore:
     ```bash
     sudo partclone.ext4 -r -s /path/to/backup.img -o /dev/sdX1
     ```
   - **Pros**: Great for cloning specific partitions efficiently.

#### 5. **Redo Rescue**
   - **Description**: Redo Rescue is an easy-to-use, open-source backup and recovery tool that allows you to clone and restore disks or partitions. It comes with a simple graphical interface, making it very user-friendly.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Full disk or partition cloning with a GUI.
     - Includes tools for data recovery and disk repair.
     - Network-based backups and restores.
   - **Installation**: Redo Rescue is available as a **live bootable USB**.
     - Download from: [redorescue.com](https://redorescue.com)
   - **Pros**: Very simple to use with a graphical interface for ease.

#### 6. **ddrescue (GNU ddrescue)**
   - **Description**: **ddrescue** is a data recovery tool that can also be used to clone disks, especially when the source disk has errors. It’s an enhanced version of `dd` designed to handle disk failures gracefully.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Focuses on cloning disks with bad sectors or damaged data.
     - Logs operations, allowing you to retry cloning failed sections.
   - **Installation**:
     ```bash
     sudo dnf install ddrescue
     ```
   - **Usage**:
     ```bash
     sudo ddrescue /dev/sdX /dev/sdY /path/to/logfile
     ```
     - `/dev/sdX`: Source disk.
     - `/dev/sdY`: Target disk.
     - `/path/to/logfile`: Log file to record the cloning process.
   - **Pros**: Ideal for recovering data from damaged or failing disks.

#### 7. **Timeshift**
   - **Description**: While **Timeshift** is primarily used for creating **system snapshots**, it can also be useful for backing up system state and restoring it after failure. It’s not a traditional disk cloning tool but can complement disk cloning efforts.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Incremental system backups (like restore points).
     - Simple GUI for setting up and managing snapshots.
     - Great for recovering from system failures or configuration issues.
   - **Installation**:
     ```bash
     sudo dnf install timeshift
     ```
   - **Usage**: Launch **Timeshift** and follow the GUI prompts to create and restore system snapshots.
   - **Pros**: Excellent for maintaining system stability with easy recovery options.

#### 8. **Acronis Cyber Protect Home Office (formerly True Image)**
   - **Description**: A powerful commercial tool for full disk cloning, backup, and recovery. Acronis is known for fast and reliable cloning, making it suitable for Fedora users looking for a premium solution.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Supports full disk cloning, migration, and backup.
     - Cloud-based backup and recovery options.
