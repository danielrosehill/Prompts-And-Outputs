     - Supports **Btrfs** file systems.
     - Can back up and restore **RAID** arrays.
   - **Bare Metal Recovery**: It supports full system images, making it suitable for bare metal restores.
   - **Usage**: Clonezilla can be used in both local and network-based backup scenarios.
   - **CLI/GUI**: Primarily **CLI** based.
   - **Website**: [Clonezilla](https://clonezilla.org)

### 2. **Relax-and-Recover (ReaR)**
   - **Description**: ReaR is an open-source backup and disaster recovery tool designed for **bare metal recovery**. It integrates well with **Btrfs** and **RAID** configurations, creating recovery media and restoring systems to bare metal.
   - **Btrfs/RAID Support**:
     - **Supports Btrfs** and **RAID arrays**.
     - Can create bootable **system rescue media**.
   - **Bare Metal Recovery**: ReaR creates a full backup, including the bootloader, disk layout, and data, and can restore a full system to bare metal.
   - **Usage**: You can create rescue images, full system snapshots, and run it automatically for backups.
   - **CLI/GUI**: Primarily **CLI** based, with detailed configuration files.
   - **Website**: [ReaR](https://relax-and-recover.org)

### 3. **Proxmox Backup Server (PBS)**
   - **Description**: **Proxmox Backup Server** is designed for incremental backups at the block level, and while it’s mainly for **virtual machines (VMs)**, it can also be used to back up entire systems. You can create **bare metal backups** using its disk image functionality.
   - **Btrfs/RAID Support**:
     - Can work with **Btrfs snapshots** as part of the backup process.
     - Supports **RAID arrays** via underlying hardware configurations or software.
   - **Bare Metal Recovery**: Proxmox Backup Server can store full disk images, enabling bare metal recovery.
   - **Usage**: Typically used in virtualized environments, but can also back up regular machines.
   - **CLI/GUI**: Provides a **web-based GUI** for managing backups.
   - **Website**: [Proxmox Backup Server](https://www.proxmox.com/en/proxmox-backup-server)

### 4. **Amanda (Advanced Maryland Automatic Network Disk Archiver)**
   - **Description**: Amanda is an enterprise-level backup solution that supports both **file-level** and **block-level backups**. It can be configured for **bare metal recovery** by backing up raw disk images.
   - **Btrfs/RAID Support**:
     - **Supports Btrfs** and **RAID** setups.
     - Amanda can perform **raw device backups** (block-level) for full system backups, making it compatible with Btrfs volumes and RAID arrays.
   - **Bare Metal Recovery**: Supports full system backups, including disk partitions and file systems, making bare metal recovery possible.
   - **Usage**: Best suited for larger environments, but can be configured for personal systems with some effort.
   - **CLI/GUI**: Primarily **CLI** based, but can be integrated with GUIs like **Zmanda** (a commercial version).
   - **Website**: [Amanda](http://www.amanda.org)

### 5. **Bacula**
   - **Description**: Bacula is a highly configurable enterprise-grade backup solution that supports **bare metal recovery** through both **file-level** and **block-level backups**. It’s widely used in larger environments but can be adapted for personal use.
   - **Btrfs/RAID Support**:
     - Supports **Btrfs** and **RAID arrays** through raw device backups.
     - Can back up partitions or entire disks for **bare metal recovery**.
   - **Bare Metal Recovery**: Bacula provides complete system backups, enabling restoration to bare metal.
   - **Usage**: Requires a more complex setup, but very powerful for full system backup and restore, with incremental, differential, and full backups.
   - **CLI/GUI**: Primarily **CLI** based with a web-based GUI option (**Bacula Enterprise**).
   - **Website**: [Bacula](https://www.bacula.org)

### 6. **Restic (with Btrfs Snapshots for Bare Metal)**:
   - **Description**: **Restic** is a modern, fast, secure backup solution with **incremental backups** and **deduplication**. While Restic itself is a **file-level backup tool**, it can work with **Btrfs snapshots** for **block-level backups** and bare metal recovery.
   - **Btrfs/RAID Support**:
     - Supports **Btrfs** when used in conjunction with **Btrfs snapshots**.
     - Supports **RAID setups**.
   - **Bare Metal Recovery**: By combining Restic with **Btrfs snapshots**, you can create **block-level backups** that support bare metal recovery. You would need to manually reinstall the bootloader after restoration.
   - **Usage**: Great for users who want encrypted, deduplicated backups, with the flexibility to work with Btrfs/RAID.
   - **CLI/GUI**: Primarily **CLI** based.
   - **Website**: [Restic](https://restic.net)

### 7. **Duplicacy**
   - **Description**: **Duplicacy** is a cross-platform, incremental backup tool with **deduplication** and **encryption**. While it focuses on **file-level backups**, it can be combined with **Btrfs snapshots** or **LVM snapshots** to support block-level backups for bare metal recovery.
   - **Btrfs/RAID Support**:
     - Supports **Btrfs** when used with **Btrfs snapshots**.
     - Works with **RAID** setups.
   - **Bare Metal Recovery**: Duplicacy can back up Btrfs/LVM snapshots, allowing for system restore in case of bare metal recovery. It does not natively back up raw disk images, so the bootloader must be manually reinstalled.
