# Prompt

What tools are available in Fedora for using PGP? Does this provide the same encryption standard as AES256. If I want to use end to end encrypted email what's the best way to do that? Doesn't Gmail already do this natively?

### **PGP Tools in Fedora**

Fedora provides several tools for working with **PGP (Pretty Good Privacy)**, which is a widely used standard for encrypting email, files, and more. PGP uses a combination of **symmetric encryption** (like AES) and **asymmetric encryption** (public-private key pairs) to secure data.

Here are some commonly available PGP tools in Fedora:

1. **GnuPG (GPG)**:
   - **GnuPG** is the open-source implementation of PGP and is the most common tool for encrypting, decrypting, and signing data in Fedora. GnuPG can be used for encrypting files or emails.
   - It supports both **symmetric encryption** (AES, Camellia, etc.) and **asymmetric encryption** using **public and private keys**.
   - You can install GPG using the following command:
     ```bash
     sudo dnf install gnupg
     ```
   - GPG integrates with many applications, including **Thunderbird** for email encryption.

2. **Seahorse**:
   - **Seahorse** is a graphical front-end for managing encryption keys (GPG and SSH keys). It allows you to easily manage PGP keys and perform encryption and decryption operations.
   - Seahorse integrates into the **GNOME desktop environment** and provides an easy way to handle encryption tasks without using the terminal.
   - You can install Seahorse using:
     ```bash
     sudo dnf install seahorse
     ```

3. **Kleopatra**:
   - **Kleopatra** is a graphical tool for managing PGP certificates and encryption. It is part of the **Gpg4win** suite and works well on Linux. You can use Kleopatra to create and manage your PGP keys and perform encryption tasks.
   - You can install it on Fedora via the **KDE** packages:
     ```bash
     sudo dnf install kleopatra
     ```

### **Does PGP Provide the Same Encryption Standard as AES-256?**

PGP and **AES-256** are used for different aspects of encryption:
- **PGP (Asymmetric Encryption)**: PGP typically uses a **public-private key pair** for encryption. This asymmetric encryption is used to securely exchange keys and for signing messages. The encryption of the actual data is done using a symmetric encryption algorithm.
- **AES-256 (Symmetric Encryption)**: PGP uses AES-256 as a **symmetric cipher** to encrypt the actual content. When you use PGP to encrypt data, the data itself is encrypted with a **symmetric algorithm like AES-256**, and then the symmetric key is encrypted with the recipient’s public key.

In short, **PGP can provide the same level of encryption as AES-256** because it often uses AES-256 to encrypt the actual content, but the key exchange mechanism is based on public-key cryptography (asymmetric encryption).

### **Best Way to Use End-to-End Encrypted Email in Fedora**

If you want to use **end-to-end encrypted email** on Fedora, PGP is one of the best ways to do this. Here’s how you can set it up:

1. **Thunderbird + Enigmail** (or Built-in OpenPGP):
   - **Thunderbird** is a popular email client that supports PGP encryption natively through its **OpenPGP** feature (previously via the **Enigmail** add-on, which is now deprecated).
   - To set up encrypted email:
     1. Install **Thunderbird**:
        ```bash
        sudo dnf install thunderbird
        ```
     2. Open **Thunderbird** and set up your email account.
     3. Go to **Account Settings** > **End-to-End Encryption**.
     4. Generate or import your PGP keys.
     5. Share your **public key** with your contacts so they can send you encrypted messages.
     6. You can now sign, encrypt, and decrypt emails using the **OpenPGP** system built into Thunderbird.

2. **Web-based Alternatives (ProtonMail, Tutanota)**:
   - If you want a simpler approach without configuring an email client, you can use a web-based email service that offers **built-in E2EE**:
     - **ProtonMail**: Provides built-in **PGP-based end-to-end encryption**. When communicating with another ProtonMail user, emails are encrypted automatically. You can also exchange encrypted emails with external users via PGP.
     - **Tutanota**: A secure email service that uses its own encryption method to offer end-to-end encrypted emails and other privacy-focused features.

   These services are fully encrypted and much easier to set up for E2EE, but they require switching away from traditional email providers like Gmail.

### **Does Gmail Support End-to-End Encryption Natively?**

No, **Gmail does not support end-to-end encryption natively** for regular email communications. Gmail uses **TLS (Transport Layer Security)** to encrypt emails **in transit** (i.e., between your device and Gmail’s servers), but:
- **Google** still has access to the content of your emails because they are stored unencrypted on Gmail’s servers.
- While Google claims it doesn't actively "read" your emails anymore for ad targeting, the emails can still be accessed by Google or anyone who gains access to your account or their servers (e.g., law enforcement with a warrant).

If you want **true end-to-end encryption** with Gmail:
- You need to use a third-party client (like Thunderbird with OpenPGP or Mailvelope) to encrypt your emails before they are sent through Gmail.
- The recipients will also need to use PGP to decrypt the messages, which adds complexity but ensures that only the intended recipient can read the content.

### **How to Use PGP with Gmail**
If you insist on using Gmail but still want E2EE, you can:
- Use a browser extension like **Mailvelope** that integrates PGP into web-based email clients like Gmail.
  - **Mailvelope** allows you to create, manage, and use PGP keys to encrypt and decrypt messages within Gmail.
  - Install Mailvelope from the Chrome or Firefox extension store, generate your PGP keys, and use it to encrypt the body of the email while using Gmail’s web interface.

### **Summary**

- **PGP Tools on Fedora**: GnuPG, Seahorse, Kleopatra, and Thunderbird (with built-in OpenPGP) are common tools to encrypt emails and files using PGP.
- **Encryption Strength**: PGP often uses **AES-256** for symmetric encryption, so it provides the same level of security for encrypting your data. However, PGP also includes public-key cryptography for key exchange, which adds another layer of security.
- **End-to-End Encryption for Email**: The best way to use E2EE for email on Fedora is to use **Thunderbird** with its built-in OpenPGP functionality. If you prefer a simpler web-based service, **ProtonMail** or **Tutanota** provide excellent options.
- **Gmail Limitations**: Gmail does not offer end-to-end encryption by default. You can use third-party tools like **Mailvelope** for PGP-based encryption if you want to secure your Gmail emails, but it requires extra steps and isn’t as seamless as dedicated services like ProtonMail.
