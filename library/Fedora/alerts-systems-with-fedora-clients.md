# Prompt

Are there any emergency alert systems that have fedora linux clients?

# Output

Based on the search results and my knowledge of Fedora Linux, there are a few options for providing conspicuous system notifications that could potentially be used for emergencies and integrated with APIs:

## Notify-send

The `notify-send` command is a standard tool available on most Linux desktops, including Fedora, for sending desktop notifications[1]. While not specifically designed for emergencies, it can be used to display prominent notifications and could be integrated into scripts or programs that connect to emergency APIs.

Key features:
- Already installed on most Fedora systems
- Can set urgency levels (low, normal, critical)
- Supports custom icons
- Allows HTML formatting in notification body
- URLs in notifications are clickable

Example usage:
```bash
notify-send -u critical "Emergency Alert" "Severe weather warning in effect"
```

## SafetyCulture

SafetyCulture (iAuditor) is a more comprehensive emergency notification software that could potentially be used on Fedora systems[3]:

- Offers a powerful notification system for delivering targeted emergency alerts
- Available as a mobile app (iOS/Android) and web-based software
- Features include:
  - Heads Up tool for communicating critical events
  - Ability to connect alarm sensors and set up notifications
  - Options to create action plans and assign tasks

While not specifically designed for Fedora, it could potentially be integrated through its web interface or API.

## FMN (Fedora Notifications)

Fedora has its own notification system called FMN (Fedora Notifications)[4]. While primarily designed for Fedora infrastructure notifications, it could potentially be adapted for emergency alerts:

- Centralized place to configure email and IRC notifications
- Filters messages from the Fedora message bus
- Can be customized to send notifications for specific events

However, FMN is more focused on Fedora-specific events rather than general emergency notifications.

## Considerations

For a robust emergency notification system on Fedora Linux, you might consider:

1. Using `notify-send` for local desktop notifications
2. Integrating with a dedicated emergency notification service API
3. Developing a custom application that combines local notifications with external data sources

It's important to note that while these options exist, none are specifically designed as comprehensive emergency notification systems for Fedora. For critical emergency alerts, it would be advisable to combine multiple notification methods and ensure reliability and timely delivery of messages.
