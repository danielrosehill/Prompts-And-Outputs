# Prompt

Sometimes I would like to install packages on my fedora computer that might cause unwanted changes. For example trying out these screen brightness adjustment utilities. Can you recommend what a good approach might be to save the configuration before applying changes? Would taking a BTRFS on demand snapshot be a good idea or is there something less dramatic?

# Output

Based on your situation of wanting to safely try out new packages like screen brightness adjustment utilities on your Fedora system, here are some recommended approaches:

1. BTRFS Snapshots:
   Yes, taking a BTRFS snapshot before making changes is an excellent idea. It's not dramatic at all - it's actually a lightweight and efficient way to create a restore point. Here's how you can do it:

   ```
   sudo btrfs subvolume snapshot / /snapshots/pre-brightness-tools
   ```

   This creates a snapshot of your root filesystem in the /snapshots directory. To restore, you'd boot into a live environment and replace the root subvolume with this snapshot.

2. Timeshift:
   If you have Timeshift set up (which works well with BTRFS), you can create a manual snapshot before making changes. This is essentially a user-friendly interface for BTRFS snapshots.

3. DNF History:
   For package management specifically, you can use DNF's history feature:
   
   ```
   sudo dnf history
   ```
   
   This shows you a list of transactions. After installing new packages, if you want to undo the changes, you can use:
   
   ```
   sudo dnf history undo <transaction-number>
   ```

4. Virtual Machine:
   For more extensive changes or if you're unsure about the impact, you could test in a virtual machine first.

5. Containerization:
   For some applications, you might consider running them in a container (like Flatpak or Docker) to isolate their impact on your system.

For trying out screen brightness utilities specifically, a BTRFS snapshot or Timeshift backup would be a good balance of safety and convenience. It's not overkill - it's a quick operation that gives you a full system restore point if needed.

Remember, after testing, if everything works well, you can delete the snapshot to free up space. If something goes wrong, you have an easy way to revert your system to its previous state.
