# Prompt

I use an extension in VS Code called Project Manager. It's a nice tool that makes switching between repos easier. But it has one flaw. The paths to the projects are hardcoded into its configuration. So if I want to do some organisation of my Git folder, the shortcuts all break. 
Can you think of any workaround? Or perhaps a different VS Code extension that simplifies working with a large and growing volume of repositories?

# Output

Based on your query and the previous context, I can suggest a few options to address the issue you're facing with the Project Manager extension in VS Code, as well as some alternatives that might better suit your needs for managing a large and growing volume of repositories.

## Potential Workarounds for Project Manager

1. **Relative Paths**: If possible, configure Project Manager to use relative paths instead of absolute paths. This might allow you to move your Git folder without breaking the shortcuts.

2. **Symlinks**: Create symbolic links in the original locations that point to the new locations of your repositories. This way, the old paths would still work even if you reorganize your folder structure.

3. **Batch Update Script**: Write a script that updates the Project Manager configuration file when you reorganize your folders. This could be automated to run periodically or manually when needed.

## Alternative Extensions

1. **Git Project Manager**:
   - This extension is specifically designed for managing Git repositories.
   - It automatically detects Git repositories in specified folders.
   - You can configure multiple folders to scan for Git repositories.

2. **GitLens**:
   - While primarily known for its Git integration features, GitLens also includes repository management capabilities[4].
   - It provides a repositories view that can help you navigate between multiple repositories easily.

3. **Multi-root Workspaces**:
   - This is a built-in VS Code feature that allows you to work with multiple project folders in a single workspace[4].
   - You can create a `.code-workspace` file that includes all your repositories, making it easy to switch between them.

4. **FolderView**:
   - This extension allows you to create custom views of your folder structure.
   - You could use it to create a view that shows all your Git repositories, regardless of their actual location on disk.

## Recommendation

Given your specific needs for managing a large number of repositories, I would recommend trying the following approach:

1. **Use Multi-root Workspaces**: Create a `.code-workspace` file that includes all your Git repositories. This will allow you to easily switch between them within VS Code.

2. **Combine with GitLens**: Use GitLens for its powerful Git integration features and its repository management capabilities. The repositories view in GitLens can help you navigate your many repositories efficiently.

3. **Consider Git Project Manager**: If you prefer a dedicated tool for managing Git repositories, try the Git Project Manager extension. Its ability to automatically detect Git repositories could be very useful as your collection grows.

This combination should provide you with flexible, scalable management of your growing repository collection, without being dependent on hardcoded paths. It will allow you to reorganize your folder structure as needed without breaking your workflow.

Remember to regularly update your workspace file or repository scan settings as you add new repositories to ensure they're included in your management system.

# Recommendation for current volume

I currently have about 300 repositories in my Git folder. It's not a huge amount but it still makes it hard to pick them out by eye sometimes. Can you recommend one of these based on that?

# Output

Based on your current situation with approximately 300 repositories and the need for easier management, I can recommend a suitable VS Code extension that would work well for your setup.

## Recommended Extension: GitLens

GitLens stands out as an excellent choice for managing a large number of repositories like yours. Here's why it's particularly well-suited for your needs:

1. **Repository View**: GitLens provides a dedicated repositories view that allows you to easily navigate and manage multiple Git repositories. This feature is especially useful when dealing with a large number of repos like your 300.

2. **Auto-detection**: GitLens can automatically detect and list all Git repositories in your workspace or in specified folders. This means you don't have to manually add each repository to a list.

3. **Quick Repository Switching**: With the repository view, you can quickly switch between different repositories, which is crucial when working with numerous projects.

4. **Integrated Git Features**: Beyond just repository management, GitLens offers powerful Git integration features that can enhance your overall workflow when working across multiple repos.

5. **Customizable Views**: You can customize how repositories are displayed and organized in the GitLens view, making it easier to find specific repos among your 300.

6. **Search Capabilities**: GitLens includes search functionality within its repository view, allowing you to quickly find specific repositories by name or other criteria.

7. **Workspace Support**: It works well with VS Code's multi-root workspaces, so you can organize your repos into logical groups if needed.

## How to Use GitLens for Your Setup

1. Install the GitLens extension from the VS Code marketplace.

2. Once installed, you'll see a new GitLens icon in your sidebar. Click on it to open the GitLens view.

3. In the GitLens view, you'll find a "Repositories" section. This will automatically list all Git repositories in your current workspace.

4. To include all 300 of your repositories:
   - Go to VS Code settings
   - Search for "GitLens: Repositories Search Paths"
   - Add the path to your Git folder (e.g., "~/Git")

5. GitLens will now display all repositories found in that folder, making it easy to navigate between them.

6. Use the search functionality within the GitLens view to quickly find specific repositories among your 300.

GitLens offers a good balance of features and usability that should work well for managing your current volume of repositories. It's also scalable, so it will continue to be useful as your number of repositories grows beyond 300. The automatic detection and listing of repositories mean you won't have to manually update anything when you add new repos or reorganize your folder structure, addressing the issue you faced with the Project Manager extension.
