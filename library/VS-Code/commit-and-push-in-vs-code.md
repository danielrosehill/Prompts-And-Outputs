# Prompt

i'd like to be able to execute a "commit and push" from the command palette in vs code. is there  a way to do this that will also allow me to type a quick commit message and not have to use my mouse for at all for this process?

# Output

Yes, you can execute a "commit and push" operation from the command palette in VS Code without using your mouse. Here's how you can set this up:

## Command Palette Commit and Push

1. Open the Command Palette by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (macOS)[1].

2. Type "Git: Commit" and select the command. This will open the commit message input field directly in the Command Palette[1].

3. Type your commit message and press `Enter` to commit the changes[1].

4. After committing, open the Command Palette again and type "Git: Push" to push your changes to the remote repository[1].

## Keyboard Shortcut for Commit and Push

To make this process even faster, you can create a custom keyboard shortcut:

1. Open the Command Palette and search for "Preferences: Open Keyboard Shortcuts (JSON)"[3].

2. Add the following JSON to your keyboard shortcuts file:

```json
[
  {
    "key": "ctrl+enter",
    "command": "workbench.action.terminal.sendSequence",
    "args": {
      "text": "git add .\u000Dgit commit -m \"${input:commitMessage}\"\u000Dgit push\u000D"
    },
    "when": "editorTextFocus"
  }
]
```

3. Save the file and restart VS Code[3].

Now you can use `Ctrl+Enter` (or `Cmd+Enter` on macOS) to trigger the commit and push process. VS Code will prompt you to enter a commit message, then automatically stage, commit, and push your changes[3].

## Alternative Method

If you prefer not to modify your keyboard shortcuts, you can use the built-in Git commands in VS Code:

1. Use `Ctrl+Enter` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Enter` (macOS) to commit your staged changes. This will open a text editor for you to type your commit message[1].

2. After typing your message, either close the editor tab or select the "Accept Commit Message" button in the editor toolbar to complete the commit[1].

3. Use the Command Palette to execute "Git: Push" to push your changes.

By using these methods, you can perform a complete "commit and push" operation using only your keyboard, making your Git workflow in VS Code more efficient.
