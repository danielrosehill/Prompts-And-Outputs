Yes, there are a few **VS Code extensions** specifically built to manage Git repositories and submodules. These tools can simplify the process of pulling, pushing, and handling submodules within a project. Here are some of the top extensions and features that can help with managing Git submodules:

### 1. **Git Submodule Manager** (Extension)

- **Git Submodule Manager** is a VS Code extension designed to streamline the management of Git submodules within the editor.
  
  **Features**:
  - List all submodules in a project.
  - Automatically initialize and update submodules.
  - Pull submodules along with the main repository.
  - Easily push changes to submodules.

  **Installation**:
  1. Open the Extensions view in VS Code (`Ctrl+Shift+X`).
  2. Search for `Git Submodule Manager`.
  3. Install the extension.

  **Usage**:
  - After installation, you can access the submodule features through the VS Code Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`). Type "Git Submodule Manager" to access options like updating or initializing submodules.

### 2. **Git Graph** (Extension)

- **Git Graph** provides a visual representation of your Git history and repository, including submodules. It supports operations such as pulling, pushing, and viewing the status of submodules.

  **Features**:
  - Visualize your repository, including branches and submodules.
  - Perform Git operations like fetch, pull, and push from the visual interface.
  - View and manage submodules within the Git Graph UI.

  **Installation**:
  1. Open the Extensions view in VS Code (`Ctrl+Shift+X`).
  2. Search for `Git Graph`.
  3. Install the extension.

  **Usage**:
  - After installation, launch **Git Graph** from the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) or click the Git Graph icon in the Activity Bar.

  **Managing Submodules**:
  - Git Graph automatically detects submodules, so you can view, update, and manage them from the visual interface. Itâ€™s a great tool if you want a more graphical interface for managing Git operations.

### 3. **GitLens** (Extension)

- **GitLens** is a powerful Git extension for VS Code that provides detailed insights into your repository, including submodule management.

  **Features**:
  - View the history of submodules and their status.
  - Perform Git actions (pull, push, fetch) directly from the file or submodule context.
  - Supports viewing and interacting with submodule changes.

  **Installation**:
  1. Open the Extensions view in VS Code (`Ctrl+Shift+X`).
  2. Search for `GitLens`.
  3. Install the extension.

  **Usage**:
  - You can perform actions on submodules through the GitLens interface. It offers visual tools, including a "Repository Explorer" where you can manage submodules along with the main repository.

  **Managing Submodules**:
  - Navigate to the "Repositories" section within GitLens to see all your repositories and submodules. You can perform Git operations like pushing, pulling, and viewing changes across submodules.

### 4. **VS Code's Built-in Git Features**

- **VS Code's built-in Git** functionality supports submodule workflows with standard Git commands. You can manually initialize, pull, or push submodules by using Git commands in the integrated terminal, as well as manage submodules through the Source Control view.

  **Pulling Submodules**:
  - Open the **Source Control** view in VS Code and manually initialize or update submodules using the built-in Git features.
  
  **Terminal Commands**:
  - For advanced control, you can use Git submodule commands directly in the integrated terminal:
    ```bash
    git submodule update --init --recursive
    ```

### Summary:
- **Git Submodule Manager**: Focused on submodule management, making it easier to initialize, update, and handle submodules.
- **Git Graph**: Provides a graphical overview of your repository and submodules, enabling easy visual management.
- **GitLens**: A comprehensive Git tool that offers insights and management features for both main repos and submodules.

These extensions can greatly simplify the process of working with Git submodules in VS Code, providing both visual tools and streamlined commands to handle common Git operations.
