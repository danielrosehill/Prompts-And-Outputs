# Prompt

I would like to automatically perform a git pull whenever I change into a new repo in VS Code to prevent accidental conflict creation. Is it possible to configure this and would there by any unintended consequnces?

# Output

While automatically performing a git pull whenever you change into a new repo in VS Code can help prevent some accidental conflicts, it's not a built-in feature of VS Code. However, there are ways to achieve something similar, along with some important considerations:

1. VS Code Auto Fetch:
VS Code has a built-in auto fetch feature that can be enabled. This doesn't perform a pull, but it does keep your local repository updated with remote changes.

To enable this:
1. Go to Settings (Ctrl+,)
2. Search for "git.autofetch"
3. Check the box to enable it

This will periodically fetch changes from the remote, allowing you to see if you're behind without automatically merging.

2. Git Hooks:
You could set up a Git hook that runs a pull when you checkout a branch. This would be a local Git configuration, not specific to VS Code.

3. Custom Extension:
You could potentially create a VS Code extension that performs a pull when you open a folder or switch workspaces.

Potential Unintended Consequences:

1. Unexpected Changes: Automatically pulling could bring in changes you're not ready for, potentially breaking your current work.

2. Merge Conflicts: If you have local changes, an automatic pull could result in merge conflicts.

3. Performance Impact: Frequent pulls could slow down your workflow, especially with large repositories or slow connections.

4. Unfinished Work: If you're in the middle of something and switch folders briefly, an automatic pull could bring in changes that affect your work in progress.

5. Dependency Issues: Pulled changes might include updates to dependencies that could break your local setup.

Recommendations:

1. Use VS Code's auto fetch feature instead of auto pull. This keeps you informed of remote changes without automatically merging them.

2. Develop good habits: Manually pull before starting work and push completed work regularly.

3. Use branches effectively to isolate work and reduce conflicts.

4. Consider using Git's stash feature to temporarily store local changes before pulling.

While automatically pulling can seem convenient, it's generally better to maintain control over when you integrate remote changes. The auto fetch feature combined with good Git practices is usually a safer approach.
