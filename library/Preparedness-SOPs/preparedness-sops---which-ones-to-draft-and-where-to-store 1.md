### **How to Store and Regularly Review These Documents**

1. **Storage Options**
   - **Physical Binder**: Keep a physical binder with printed copies of all SOPs in an accessible location (e.g., near the entrance or a secure closet). Use dividers to separate different categories.
   - **Digital Backup**: Store digital copies in a secure cloud service (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox) so you can access them from any device. Ensure the folder is organized and clearly labeled.
   - **USB Flash Drive**: Keep an encrypted USB flash drive with the digital versions as a backup in case of network or power outages.

2. **Regular Review Suggestions**
   - **Monthly Check-Ins**: Set a recurring monthly reminder to review one SOP in detail. This helps keep the content fresh and ensures youâ€™re familiar with procedures.
   - **Annual Drills**: Once a year, conduct a drill for the more complex SOPs, such as evacuation or missile attack protocols. This can help identify any gaps or changes that need to be made.
   - **Update as Needed**: Review the SOPs after any significant change in your home, local environment, or after relevant experiences (e.g., an actual emergency or local advisory).

By keeping these SOPs organized and accessible, and regularly reviewing them, you can ensure that you and Hannah are prepared for any situation that may arise while living in Jerusalem.
