# Prompt

any standalone tool that does incremental block level backups?

# Output

Yes, there are standalone tools that specifically handle **incremental block-level backups** without needing to rely on external filesystems or snapshot mechanisms like LVM, BTRFS, or ZFS. Here are the most prominent ones that can work on Fedora and focus on block-level, incremental backups:

### 1. **Veeam Agent for Linux (Free)**
- **Overview**: Veeam Agent for Linux is one of the most robust standalone tools available for block-level, incremental backups. It’s enterprise-grade software that supports full, incremental, and differential backups at the block level. It is widely used in the industry and works efficiently for both personal and business needs.
  
- **Key Features**:
  - **Incremental Block-Level Backups**: After the initial full backup, only the changed blocks are saved.
  - **Compression and Deduplication**: Reduces storage requirements.
  - **Backup to Various Targets**: Supports local drives, network shares, and cloud backups.
  - **Bare-Metal Recovery**: You can restore your entire system onto new hardware.
  
- **Installation**:
  Download the RPM from the Veeam website and install it:
  ```bash
  sudo rpm -ivh veeam-release*
  sudo dnf install veeam
  ```
  
- **Command to Create a Backup Job**:
  ```bash
  sudo veeamconfig job create --name "SystemBackup" --realtime --mode full --path /path/to/backup
  ```
  
- **Advantages**:
  - Supports full, incremental, and differential backups.
  - Industry-standard solution with a strong track record for reliability.
  - Easy to set up and manage through both CLI and a GUI.
