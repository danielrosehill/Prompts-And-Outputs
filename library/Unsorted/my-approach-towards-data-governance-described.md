# Prompt

I was wondering if you could help me to define and describe a key philosophy of mine when it comes to technology. I love the convenience of cloud solutions. However, a key criterion that I use when evaluating prospective solutions (for myself or at work) is how users are able to backup their data from the platform. It's not that I particularly enjoy taking backups. It's that I believe that users should always have an unhindered right to their data. And that for that right to be in any way meaningful in the real world of technology, users should be able to export their data however they wish (e.g. to a cloud of their choosing) programatically and conveniently. There are many SaaS tools I would love to use but which I don't for this reason. Frequently I end up self hosting tools not because I'm trying to save money, but rather because it's the only solution that I feel comfortable with from a data governance standpoint. In an ideal world, I'd much rather *not* manage my own infrastructure. But I don't want to forsake the right to access and own my data. I think that's probably enough. How would you define my approach?

# Output

Your approach to technology can be defined as a **"Data Sovereignty-Centric Approach to Technology Adoption."** This philosophy places a high value on the principle that users should have full ownership, control, and access to their data. It emphasizes the importance of being able to back up data independently and without restrictions, ensuring that data is portable and can be exported to any platform or cloud of the user's choosing. 

This approach often leads you to prioritize solutions that respect and facilitate these rights, even if it means self-hosting tools and managing your own infrastructure. Your ideal scenario would be to enjoy the convenience of cloud solutions without compromising on data governance and sovereignty, reflecting a deep commitment to ensuring that the right to access and own your data remains meaningful and unhindered.## Extracted Prompts
