# Prompt

Inoreader is a very nice tool and close to what I'm looking for. However, it doesn't have the ability to embed live TV feeds, which was also a requirement (I could provide links). Do you have any other suggestions that might address this?

# Outputs

Got it—let's focus on tools that can handle **both content aggregation** and **live TV embedding**. Here are some solutions that can more directly meet your need to aggregate diverse content types, including live TV feeds:

### 1. **Netvibes (Revisited)**
   - **Netvibes** is one of the few tools that allows for truly flexible dashboard customization, including live widgets for streaming media. You can create custom "potions" (similar to workflows) to bring in different kinds of content, including live TV streams if they are embeddable (e.g., YouTube Live, Twitch). The interface is also more modern compared to Newsblur.
   - **Pricing**: Starts at **$24/month** for personal premium plans; higher for enterprise features.

### 2. **Klipfolio**
   - **Klipfolio** is a robust option for building customized dashboards that can include **live TV feeds**. It allows you to integrate multiple widgets, including streaming video from supported platforms like **YouTube**, **Vimeo**, or custom embedded streams. It’s very much focused on visual dashboards, making it perfect if you want a clean view of live streams alongside aggregated news.
   - **Pricing**: Starts at **$99/month**, which includes a lot of customization options.

### 3. **Mighty Networks**
   - **Mighty Networks** isn’t a traditional RSS aggregator, but it allows you to create a community-based platform where you can curate content—including live TV feeds. You can set up **live streaming** events directly on the platform, plus aggregate news from various feeds to create a multimedia community hub.
   - **Pricing**: Starts at **$33/month** for the Community Plan; the **Business Plan** (which allows more customization) is **$99/month**.

### 4. **Mux + Custom Dashboard**
   - **Mux** is a platform designed to handle live streaming video. You could integrate Mux's live streaming capabilities with a customizable dashboard platform like **Notion** or **Coda**. Mux provides embeddable live feeds, and pairing it with a dashboard would allow you to show both live video and aggregated news feeds.
   - **Pricing**: Pay-as-you-go for live streaming (roughly **$0.005/min** of video, plus additional hosting and delivery costs). You would need to also pay for **Notion** or **Coda**, which adds around **$8-$15/month** per user.

### 5. **ScreenCloud**
   - **ScreenCloud** offers digital signage solutions, but it has capabilities to embed **live TV feeds**, along with dashboards for content aggregation. You can embed YouTube Live, news videos, and even direct video URLs into one display setup. It’s usually used for displaying digital content on large screens but works well for creating a unified media dashboard.
   - **Pricing**: Starts at **$20/month** per screen, which can be suitable for setting up a content and live stream aggregation environment.

### 6. **Vizia + Custom Embedding**
   - **Vizia** allows embedding of live video feeds alongside interactive content. This can be an interesting choice if you’re looking to create a custom dashboard where you can aggregate live TV alongside other interactive widgets or feeds. It's more of an interactive media tool but works well for blending different content types.
   - **Pricing**: Free for limited features; contact for custom pricing if scaling up to professional usage.

### Summary for Live TV + Aggregation:
- **Netvibes** and **Klipfolio** are strong contenders if you need a polished dashboard that handles both news aggregation and live TV embedding.
- **ScreenCloud** is useful for its versatility in embedding live feeds with other types of content.
- **Mux** is a robust streaming platform that could be paired with other tools to create a powerful aggregated view.

I’d suggest either **Klipfolio** for a more customizable experience or **ScreenCloud** for something purpose-built for displaying various media types, including live streams.

Do any of these solutions sound like a good fit for your needs, or is there a particular setup that you'd like to dive into more deeply?
