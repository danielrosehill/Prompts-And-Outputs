### **Tooljet:**

**Responsive Design:**

\- **General Overview:** Tooljet is focused on building internal tools with a low-code approach, and it offers a relatively straightforward drag-and-drop interface for designing UIs. While Tooljet provides basic responsive design capabilities, it may not be as advanced or flexible as other tools that are specifically optimized for building mobile-first or highly responsive applications.

\- **Strengths:**

\- **Basic Responsiveness:** Tooljet supports basic responsive design, meaning that your interfaces should adapt to different screen sizes to some extent. However, the level of control over responsiveness may be limited.

\- **Custom Scripting:** You can add custom JavaScript to handle certain responsive behaviors, but this requires some technical knowledge.

\- **Limitations:**

\- **Limited Mobile Optimization:** Tooljet's UI components are more optimized for desktop use, and while they will adapt to different screen sizes, they might not be fully optimized for mobile experiences.

\- **Customization:** Advanced customization of responsive behavior may require more manual intervention, such as writing custom CSS or JavaScript.

### **JetAdmin:**

**Responsive Design:**

\- **General Overview:** JetAdmin is another low-code platform focused on building internal tools and admin panels. It provides more polished responsive design capabilities compared to Tooljet, making it a better choice if responsiveness is a critical factor in your admin tool.

\- **Strengths:**

\- **Mobile Optimization:** JetAdmin offers better support for mobile optimization out of the box, meaning your admin panels and dashboards will generally look good on various devices, including smartphones and tablets.

\- **Adaptive Layouts:** JetAdmin supports adaptive layouts, which allows your interface to automatically adjust based on the device's screen size.

\- **Pre-built Components:** JetAdmin comes with a range of pre-built components that are designed to be responsive, reducing the need for manual adjustments.

\- **Limitations:**

\- **Advanced Customization:** While JetAdmin offers better responsiveness, it might still require some custom adjustments for very complex or highly tailored mobile interfaces.

### **Comparison:**

\- **Tooljet:** Offers basic responsiveness suitable for desktop-first internal tools. It is more limited in terms of mobile optimization and may require additional work for custom responsive behavior.

\- **JetAdmin:** Provides better out-of-the-box support for responsive design, making it more suitable for use cases where mobile or tablet access is important. It has stronger adaptive layout features and pre-built components designed with responsiveness in mind.

### **Conclusion:**

\- **Choose Tooljet** if your primary focus is on desktop admin tools and you need a basic, functional interface with minimal emphasis on mobile responsiveness.

\- **Choose JetAdmin** if you need more polished, responsive designs that adapt well to different devices, especially if your users are likely to access your admin tools from mobile devices.
