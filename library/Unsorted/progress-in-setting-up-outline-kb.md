### **Outline Knowledge Base Setup on GCP: Current Progress and Next Steps**

#### **Current Status**:
- The **Docker containers** for Outline, PostgreSQL, Redis, and Nginx are now running without connection errors.
- The **Outline homepage** is accessible, showing a "Continue with Slack" prompt for authentication.

#### **Next Steps** (for tomorrow):
1. **Configure Authentication**:
   - Either configure **default login credentials** or complete the **Slack authentication setup** to log in.
   - Investigate if Outline offers an option for manual account creation if Slack is not preferred or available.

#### **Current Configuration**:
- **Docker Compose** is orchestrating:
  - **PostgreSQL** (database)
  - **Redis** (caching)
  - **Nginx** (SSL and reverse proxy)
  - **Outline** (knowledge base application)
  
- **Environment Variables** have been configured:
  - `PGSSLMODE=disable` (PostgreSQL SSL disabled)
  - `REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379` (pointing to the Redis container)

This document captures the current state of your setup. Tomorrow, you can proceed with configuring the authentication for Outline either by setting up a default account or finalizing the Slack integration.
