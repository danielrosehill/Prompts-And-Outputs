*Note: this repository consists of the outputs of large language models (LLMs). In many cases, these are unedited or minimally edited. The information provided is for demonstrative purposes only and is intended to highlight constraints and capabilities in LLM applications and prompt engineering strategies.*


# Prompt
What are the major RAGs and are there any open source RAGs?

# Output

Based on the search results and your question, I can provide an overview of major RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) frameworks, including open-source options:

Major RAG Frameworks:

1. Pathway: A high-throughput, low-latency framework for production AI applications with RAG capabilities.

2. Cohere: Offers advanced RAG capabilities with a focus on enterprise-level, multilingual use cases.

3. LlamaIndex: A SaaS-based framework enhancing RAG with efficient indexing and advanced retrieval capabilities.

4. LangChain: An orchestrator designed to integrate LLMs with external data sources and APIs.

5. Haystack: A flexible open-source AI framework for building end-to-end LLM-powered applications.

6. DSPY: Not detailed in the search results, but mentioned as one of the top RAG frameworks for 2024.

7. OpenAI API with Assistants API: Allows file uploads for RAG-like functionality.

Open-Source RAG Frameworks:

1. Haystack: Explicitly mentioned as an open-source framework.

2. LangChain: While it offers commercial services, it also has open-source components.

3. LlamaIndex: Although primarily SaaS-based, it has open-source components available on GitHub.

4. FARM: An internal framework from Deepset for building transformer-based NLP pipelines including RAG.

5. REALM: A Google toolkit for open-domain question answering with RAG.

Other Notable Mentions:

- Azure Machine Learning: Enables RAG through Azure Cognitive Services.
- Hugging Face Transformer plugin: Provides a transformer to generate RAG models.
- Meta AI: Combines retrieval and generation within a single framework.

It's worth noting that many of these frameworks, even if not fully open-source, often have open-source components or libraries that developers can use and contribute to. The field of RAG is rapidly evolving, with new tools and frameworks emerging regularly.
