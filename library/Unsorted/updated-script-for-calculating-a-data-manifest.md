**Summary of Prompt:** You asked for a script that processes all CSV files in the directory where the script is run and generates a manifest for each CSV into a subfolder called `params` within the same directory.

---

Hereâ€™s the modified script that will generate the manifest for each CSV in the current folder, and save the output into a new folder called `params`:

```python
import pandas as pd
import os

def generate_manifest_for_all_csvs():
    # Get the current working directory
    current_dir = os.getcwd()
    
    # Create a folder called 'params' within the current directory to store the manifests
    output_folder = os.path.join(current_dir, 'params')
    if not os.path.exists(output_folder):
        os.makedirs(output_folder)
    
    # Get a list of all CSV files in the current directory
    csv_files = [f for f in os.listdir(current_dir) if f.endswith('.csv')]
    
    # Loop through each CSV file and generate a manifest
    for csv_file in csv_files:
        # Load CSV file into a pandas DataFrame
        csv_path = os.path.join(current_dir, csv_file)
        df = pd.read_csv(csv_path)

        # Create a list to hold information about each column
        manifest = []

        for col in df.columns:
            col_info = {
                'Column Name': col,
                'Data Type': df[col].dtype,
                'Unique Values': df[col].nunique(),
                'Description/Notes': 'Add description here'  # Can be customized
            }
            manifest.append(col_info)

        # Convert the manifest list into a DataFrame
        manifest_df = pd.DataFrame(manifest)
        
        # Generate the output filename for the manifest
        output_file = os.path.join(output_folder, f"{os.path.splitext(csv_file)[0]}_manifest.csv")
        
        # Save the manifest DataFrame to a CSV file in the 'params' folder
        manifest_df.to_csv(output_file, index=False)
        print(f"Manifest for {csv_file} saved to {output_file}")

# Run the function
generate_manifest_for_all_csvs()
```

### **Explanation:**
- **Folder creation:** The script creates a folder named `params` in the directory where it runs, if the folder does not already exist.
- **Manifest generation:** It processes each CSV file in the current directory, generating a manifest with column names, data types, and unique value counts.
- **Output:** Each manifest is saved as a CSV file in the `params` folder, named as `original_filename_manifest.csv`.

When you run this script, it will generate a manifest for all CSV files in the current directory and store them in the `params` folder.
