**Prompt Summary:**
Daniel has begun managing a lot of local hardware for his smart home setup and finds it difficult to keep track of model numbers, details, and user manuals. He requested suggestions for digital systems designed to organize this information.

**Response:**
Here are a few systems that can help you manage hardware information effectively:

1. **Home Inventory Software:**
   - **Home Inventory Apps (e.g., Sortly, Memento Database):** These apps allow you to catalog your devices, store model numbers, warranty details, and even attach user manuals as PDFs. They are user-friendly and great for visual organization, with options to add photos and detailed descriptions.
   - **Home Assistant Add-ons:** Consider exploring add-ons or integrations specifically for device management. For example, the **Home Assistant Device Tracker** or using **Node-RED** to create custom flows that can pull device details and show them on dashboards.

2. **Digital Note-Taking and Database Solutions:**
   - **Notion:** You can set up a database to track each device, including fields for model numbers, purchase dates, warranty periods, and links to user manuals. It's flexible and allows you to customize how data is displayed (e.g., lists, cards, tables).
   - **Obsidian:** Since you already use it, you could create a specific vault or section for smart home devices. You can link entries for each device, tag them by room or function, and attach user manuals or additional details.

3. **Document Management Systems (DMS):**
   - **Nextcloud or OwnCloud:** If you have a server setup, these tools can manage files and folders. You can create a structured folder system with categories for manuals, device photos, and specification sheets. Both platforms offer search functions that make finding information easy.
   - **MediaWiki or BookStack:** These are self-hosted wiki platforms. You can build a centralized knowledge base where each device has its own page, including model details, setup instructions, and troubleshooting notes. 

4. **Self-Hosted Asset Management Tools:**
   - **Snipe-IT:** An open-source asset management system designed for tracking equipment and IT assets. It supports storing serial numbers, location information, and even has fields for warranty expiration. It's more IT-focused but can be adapted for smart home use.
   - **Open-AudIT:** Primarily for IT network audits, but can be customized to track device types, IP addresses, and more. It might be useful if you need a system to scan your network for connected devices.

5. **Smart Home Management Dashboard:**
   - **Hubitat Elevation Dashboard:** If you're already using Home Assistant, consider adding a dashboard to track details of each connected device. Use YAML files to create custom cards displaying key information and link to manuals or specifications stored locally or online.

These options vary from simple inventory apps to more complex self-hosted solutions. Choose based on how detailed you want to get and whether you prefer a cloud or local setup.
