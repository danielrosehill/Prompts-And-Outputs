**Prompt summary:** You shared the output of your `btrfs subvolume list` command and pointed out that none of the listed subvolumes seem to represent your home directory.

From the output, it looks like your **home directory is a subvolume** with the ID `256` and path `home`. The other subvolumes appear to be related to various snapshots of your root filesystem and other system components (such as `/var/lib/machines` and `.snapshots`).

Given that your home directory is part of your root filesystem and is a separate subvolume, hereâ€™s how you can proceed to snapshot both your **root** and **home** subvolumes:

### Steps to Take Full System Snapshots (Including `/home`):

1. **Snapshot the Root Subvolume (`root`)**:
   The subvolume for your root filesystem has the path `root`. You'll create a snapshot of this and save it in the `daniel-workstation` folder on your external SSD.
   ```bash
   sudo btrfs subvolume snapshot /root /run/media/daniel/Workstation/daniel-workstation/root_snapshot_$(date +%F)
   ```

2. **Snapshot the Home Subvolume (`home`)**:
   The home subvolume has the path `home`, so you can snapshot it separately:
   ```bash
   sudo btrfs subvolume snapshot /home /run/media/daniel/Workstation/daniel-workstation/home_snapshot_$(date +%F)
   ```

3. **Verify the Snapshots**:
   After taking the snapshots, confirm they exist on the external SSD:
   ```bash
   ls /run/media/daniel/Workstation/daniel-workstation
   ```

You should now see both `root_snapshot_YYYY-MM-DD` and `home_snapshot_YYYY-MM-DD` in the `daniel-workstation` folder.

### Full Snapshot Workflow Summary:

- **Root Subvolume**: `/root`
- **Home Subvolume**: `/home`
- **Backup Location**: `/run/media/daniel/Workstation/daniel-workstation`

### Snapshot Commands:

```bash
sudo btrfs subvolume snapshot /root /run/media/daniel/Workstation/daniel-workstation/root_snapshot_$(date +%F)
sudo btrfs subvolume snapshot /home /run/media/daniel/Workstation/daniel-workstation/home_snapshot_$(date +%F)
```

By following these steps, you'll have a full backup of both your root and home subvolumes, saved in your specified directory on the SSD.

**Prompt summary:** You're asking if it's possible to take a single Btrfs snapshot that covers both the root filesystem and the home subvolume, instead of taking two separate snapshots.

In **Btrfs**, subvolumes (like `/root` and `/home`) are treated as separate entities. This means that each subvolume needs to be snapshotted individually. There is **no way to take one snapshot that covers multiple subvolumes** because Btrfs snapshots are designed to snapshot subvolumes independently.

### Why Subvolumes Are Snapshotted Separately:
- Each subvolume acts like its own mini-filesystem, which allows them to be snapshotted, mounted, and managed independently.
- This separation provides flexibility (e.g., you can exclude certain subvolumes from backups, or snapshot only specific areas like `/home`).

### Options:
- **Snapshot all subvolumes individually**: This is the typical way of capturing all data.
- **Single snapshot only for the root filesystem**: If `/home` is part of the root filesystem (i.e., not a separate subvolume), it would be included in a root snapshot. However, since `/home` is its own subvolume in your setup, you need to snapshot it separately.

### Recommended Workflow:
You will need to take **two snapshots**: one for the root (`/`) and one for the home subvolume (`/home`), as described in my previous response. Here's a quick recap of the commands:

```bash
sudo btrfs subvolume snapshot /root /run/media/daniel/Workstation/daniel-workstation/root_snapshot_$(date +%F)
sudo btrfs subvolume snapshot /home /run/media/daniel/Workstation/daniel-workstation/home_snapshot_$(date +%F)
```

This ensures both the root filesystem and your home directory are backed up, covering all critical system data.
