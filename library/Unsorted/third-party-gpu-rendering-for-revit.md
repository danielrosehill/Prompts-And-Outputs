For **V-Ray Cloud Rendering** (Chaos Cloud), the cost is typically calculated based on **credits**, and you can estimate the credit consumption based on the complexity of your rendering job. Prices for GPU rendering are higher compared to CPU rendering, but **Chaos Cloud** offers a **pay-as-you-go model** where you only pay for the resources used. There are no upfront hardware or setup costs, and Chaos Cloud handles the licensing for you.

**V-Ray GPU Cloud** rendering prices vary but typically start at **$3.00 to $4.49 per server-hour** depending on the rendering farm, with billing done per minute. Some services, like **RenderStreet**, offer this GPU pricing structure【184†source】【186†source】.

For **pay-as-you-go (PAYG) GPU options**, many cloud providers offer GPU rendering for V-Ray. Services like **Fox Renderfarm** and **RenderStreet** allow users to pay per GPU node or per hour, with prices starting at around **$2 per node per hour** or **$3.00 per server-hour**, depending on the provider and rendering load【186†source】【187†source】. These services provide flexibility to scale GPU power as needed without owning the hardware.

If you prefer on-demand GPU rendering without the need to manage local hardware, these options are quite cost-effective for smaller projects or occasional use.
