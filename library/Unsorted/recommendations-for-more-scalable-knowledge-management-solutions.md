*Note: this repository consists of the outputs of large language models (LLMs). In many cases, these are unedited or minimally edited. The information provided is for demonstrative purposes only and is intended to highlight constraints and capabilities in LLM applications and prompt engineering strategies.*


# Prompt

Based on your query and the previous context, it seems you're looking for markdown editors or note-taking systems that can handle very large amounts of data and scale to serious levels of storage. While Obsidian has some limitations when it comes to extremely large vaults, there are other options that might be more suitable for your needs:

# Output

Based on your query and the previous context, it seems you're looking for markdown editors or note-taking systems that can handle very large amounts of data and scale to serious levels of storage. While Obsidian has some limitations when it comes to extremely large vaults, there are other options that might be more suitable for your needs:

1. WikiJS:
   - Open-source wiki software built with Node.js
   - Designed for performance and scalability
   - Supports various databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, MS SQL Server, SQLite)
   - Can handle large repositories efficiently[2]

2. XWiki:
   - Enterprise-grade, open-source wiki platform
   - Offers structured data capabilities
   - Supports scalability across various platforms
   - Used by major organizations like Amazon[2]

3. MediaWiki:
   - The software that powers Wikipedia
   - Designed to handle large-scale wikis with millions of articles
   - Proven track record of managing high traffic loads
   - Offers robust search capabilities and version control[2]

4. BookStack:
   - Open-source, self-hosted platform for organizing and storing information
   - Uses a book-like organizational structure (books, chapters, pages)
   - Can handle large amounts of content efficiently
   - Supports full-text search[2]

5. Custom Solution:
   - For your specific use case of managing LLM interaction outputs at scale, you might consider developing a custom solution using:
     - A database system (e.g., PostgreSQL) for efficient data storage and retrieval
     - A search engine (e.g., Elasticsearch) for fast full-text search capabilities
     - A web-based frontend for user interaction and visualization[1]

When choosing a platform, consider factors like:
- Expected size of your repository
- Types of content you'll be storing
- Technical expertise for maintenance
- Specific features needed for your workflow

It's worth noting that while these solutions can handle large amounts of data, they may require more setup and maintenance compared to simpler note-taking apps. However, they offer the scalability and robustness needed for serious levels of storage.
