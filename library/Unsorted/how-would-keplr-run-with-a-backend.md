Keplr is great, but I'd like to deploy it for a public facing site. Could it be used for this purpose? Could you suggest some ways that I could run the backend / feed in the data?

# Output

Yes, **Kepler.gl** can definitely be used for a **public-facing site** where you showcase interactive visualizations. However, Kepler.gl itself is more focused on the **frontend** (visualization) and requires a data source (backend) to feed in the data dynamically. Below are several options for how you can **deploy Kepler.gl** for public use and manage the backend:

### 1. **Embed Kepler.gl in a Website**
   - **What it is**: After creating a visualization in Kepler.gl, you can export it as an **HTML file** and embed it into your website. This makes the visualization available for public access.
   - **How to do it**:
     - Create your map in **Kepler.gl**.
     - Use the **Export Map** option to get an HTML file or JSON configuration.
     - Embed the HTML file into a webpage or use the JSON configuration with a custom-built site.
   - **Drawback**: Static data unless you rebuild the map with updated datasets manually.

### 2. **Kepler.gl with a Backend API**
   - **What it is**: Kepler.gl can consume data dynamically from an API. This allows you to create a live public-facing site where the data updates automatically as new information is added to your database.
   - **How to do it**:
     - Set up a **REST API** or **GraphQL API** (e.g., using **Node.js** with **Express**, or a headless CMS like **Strapi**).
     - Kepler.gl can fetch the data from the API endpoint dynamically, and the visualizations will update in real-time.
   - **Example stack**:
     - **Frontend**: Kepler.gl embedded in a static site generator (e.g., **Next.js** or **Gatsby**).
     - **Backend**: A headless CMS (e.g., **Strapi**, **Contentful**) or a custom-built API.
     - **Database**: You can store your data in a database like **PostgreSQL**, **MongoDB**, or **Airtable**.
   - **Why it's good**: This method allows you to continuously update your data and visualizations without having to manually intervene.

### 3. **Kepler.gl with Google Sheets or Airtable (No Code Backend)**
   - **What it is**: You can use **Google Sheets** or **Airtable** as a simple backend for your Kepler.gl visualizations.
   - **How to do it**:
     - Store your data in Google Sheets or Airtable.
     - Use the **Kepler.gl API** to pull the data directly from these sources.
   - **Example stack**:
     - **Frontend**: A simple site built with **Gatsby** or **Next.js** where the visualization is embedded.
     - **Backend**: **Google Sheets** or **Airtable** as a lightweight backend.
     - **Why it works**: No code is required for backend management, and non-technical users can easily update data in a spreadsheet format.

### 4. **Kepler.gl + AWS S3 for Data Storage**
   - **What it is**: If you prefer to host your data on cloud storage like **AWS S3**, you can use Kepler.gl to pull the data from S3 via its public API.
   - **How to do it**:
     - Upload your dataset to **S3** and generate a public URL.
     - In Kepler.gl, use the public URL to load the data dynamically.
   - **Why it's good**: AWS S3 is scalable and reliable for hosting large datasets, and it integrates well with Kepler.gl.

### 5. **Using Superset as a Backend for Kepler.gl**
   - **What it is**: If you're looking for a more robust **data exploration backend**, you can use **Apache Superset** to manage your data and feed it into Kepler.gl.
   - **How to do it**:
     - Set up Superset to query and visualize data.
     - Export data from Superset to feed into Kepler.gl, or even integrate Kepler.gl visualizations into the Superset dashboards.
   - **Why it's good**: Superset allows you to manage and query data easily and provides advanced data visualization and exploration capabilities alongside Kepler.gl's interactive maps.

### Platforms and Tools to Combine with Kepler.gl for a Full Publishing Solution:
1. **Next.js** (Frontend) + **Strapi** (Backend) + **PostgreSQL** (Database)
2. **Gatsby** (Frontend) + **Airtable** or **Google Sheets** (No-code Backend)
3. **AWS S3** (Data Storage) + **Kepler.gl** (Frontend Visualization)
4. **Kepler.gl** + **Superset** (for Data Exploration and Visualization)

By integrating Kepler.gl with these backend solutions, you can create a **dynamic, public-facing site** that displays updated visualizations, making your dataset on impact investing more engaging and accessible.
