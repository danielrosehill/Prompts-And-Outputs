Can you come up with a good volume name on my NAS for overflow files form my desktop (those that I don't need to keep there all the time? Next, please come up with a mount point for it and teach me how to configure it to mount on boot. NAS IP is 192.168.1.50

To summarize: you're asking for a good **volume name** for overflow files from your desktop, a suitable **mount point** on your Fedora system, and how to configure it to **mount at boot** from your NAS (IP: 192.168.1.50).

### Suggested Volume Name:
- **Volume Name**: Since this will store **overflow files** (those that don't need to be kept on the desktop all the time), a meaningful name could be:
  - `desktop_overflow`
  - `desktop_archive`
  - `desktop_offload`

### Suggested Mount Point:
- **Mount Point**: A common practice is to mount external or network volumes in the `/mnt/` or `/media/` directories. Hereâ€™s a good mount point:
  - `/mnt/desktop_overflow`

### Step-by-Step Setup to Mount NAS at Boot:

#### 1. **Create the Mount Point Directory**:
   First, create a mount point on your Fedora system:
   ```bash
   sudo mkdir -p /mnt/desktop_overflow
   ```

#### 2. **Mount the NAS Manually to Test**:
   Before configuring automatic mounting, test the manual mount process to ensure it works correctly.

   Assuming your NAS is sharing the volume via **NFS**, run:
   ```bash
   sudo mount -t nfs 192.168.1.50:/volume1/desktop_overflow /mnt/desktop_overflow
   ```

   If you are using **SMB/CIFS** instead of NFS, the command would be:
   ```bash
   sudo mount -t cifs //192.168.1.50/desktop_overflow /mnt/desktop_overflow -o username=your_username,password=your_password
   ```

   Replace `your_username` and `your_password` with the appropriate NAS credentials if needed.

#### 3. **Check the Mount**:
   Verify the mount by listing the contents of the directory:
   ```bash
   df -h | grep /mnt/desktop_overflow
   ls /mnt/desktop_overflow
   ```

   If everything is working as expected, proceed to the next step.

#### 4. **Configure the NAS to Mount at Boot**:
   To make sure the NAS volume mounts automatically every time your system boots, add an entry to the `/etc/fstab` file.

   **Edit the `/etc/fstab` file**:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/fstab
   ```

   Add the following line at the end of the file to mount the NAS at boot.

   **For NFS**:
   ```bash
   192.168.1.50:/volume1/desktop_overflow /mnt/desktop_overflow nfs defaults 0 0
   ```

   **For SMB/CIFS**:
   If you're using **SMB/CIFS** instead of NFS, the entry would look like this:
   ```bash
   //192.168.1.50/desktop_overflow /mnt/desktop_overflow cifs username=your_username,password=your_password,iocharset=utf8,vers=3.0 0 0
   ```

   - Replace `your_username` and `your_password` with your NAS credentials.
   - If you don't want your password to appear in plaintext in `/etc/fstab`, you can create a credentials file and reference it instead:
     ```bash
     sudo nano /etc/samba/nas_credentials
     ```
     Add:
     ```
     username=your_username
     password=your_password
     ```
     Then change the `/etc/fstab` entry to:
     ```bash
     //192.168.1.50/desktop_overflow /mnt/desktop_overflow cifs credentials=/etc/samba/nas_credentials,iocharset=utf8,vers=3.0 0 0
     ```
     Finally, secure the credentials file:
     ```bash
     sudo chmod 600 /etc/samba/nas_credentials
     ```

#### 5. **Test the Mount at Boot**:
   After updating the `/etc/fstab` file, test the configuration without rebooting by running:
   ```bash
   sudo mount -a
   ```

   If there are no errors and the mount works as expected, the NAS will now mount automatically each time you reboot.

### Summary:
- **Volume Name**: `desktop_overflow`.
- **Mount Point**: `/mnt/desktop_overflow`.
- To **configure auto-mount at boot**, edit `/etc/fstab` with the appropriate NFS or SMB mount command.
- Test the configuration by running `sudo mount -a`.
