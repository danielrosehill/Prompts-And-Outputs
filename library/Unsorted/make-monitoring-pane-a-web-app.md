# Prompt

Is there any way that I could make this a web app that I could display and access from the internet somehow?

# Output

Yes, you can definitely turn your Python script into a web application that can be accessed from the internet. Based on the information provided in the search results, here are some steps you can take to deploy your Python application as a web app:

1. Use a Web Framework:
   Convert your Python script into a web application using a framework like Flask. Flask is a lightweight and easy-to-use framework that's great for beginners[6].

2. Create a Basic Flask App:
   Create a file named `main.py` with a basic Flask application structure[6]:

   ```python
   from flask import Flask

   app = Flask(__name__)

   @app.route("/")
   def index():
       return "Congratulations, it's a web app!"
   ```

3. Specify Dependencies:
   Create a `requirements.txt` file listing your project dependencies[6]:

   ```
   Flask==2.1.2
   ```

4. Choose a Hosting Provider:
   Select a cloud platform to host your application. Some options include:
   - Google App Engine (free tier available)[6]
   - Azure App Service (free tier available)[5]
   - Heroku (free tier available)[3]
   - PythonAnywhere (free tier available)[3]

5. Deploy Your Application:
   Follow the deployment process for your chosen platform. For example, if using Azure App Service, you can use the Azure CLI[5]:

   ```
   az webapp up --runtime PYTHON:3.9 --sku B1 --logs
   ```

6. Access Your Web App:
   Once deployed, your application will be accessible via a URL provided by your hosting service[5].

Remember to consider security aspects when deploying your application to the internet. Also, be aware of any usage limits or costs associated with your chosen hosting platform.

By following these steps, you can transform your local Python script into a web application that's accessible from anywhere on the internet. The exact process may vary slightly depending on the hosting provider you choose, but the general principles remain the same.
