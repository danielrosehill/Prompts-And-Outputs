Yes, the `SECRET_KEY` and `UTILS_SECRET` should ideally be separate keys, and they should be recorded securely. Here are some detailed guidelines on handling these keys:

### 1. **Separate Keys**
- **Reason for Separation**:
  - **Security Best Practices**: Using separate keys for different purposes adheres to security best practices. This way, if one key is compromised, the other remains secure.
  - **Specificity**: Different components or services of an application may have varying security requirements. Having separate keys allows for tailored security measures.

### 2. **Recording the Keys**
- **Secure Storage**:
  - **Environment Variables**: Storing these keys in a `.env` file (as youâ€™re doing) is a common practice, but ensure that the file is not exposed in version control (e.g., add it to your `.gitignore`).
  - **Secret Management Tools**: Consider using secret management tools such as:
    - **HashiCorp Vault**: For secure storage and access control.
    - **AWS Secrets Manager or GCP Secret Manager**: For managing secrets and sensitive information securely.
  - **Encrypted Storage**: If you need to keep the keys in a file, ensure the file is encrypted and access is controlled.

### 3. **Access Control**
- **Limit Access**: Only allow access to these keys to users or services that absolutely need them. This minimizes the risk of accidental exposure or compromise.

### 4. **Backup and Recovery**
- **Record Keys Securely**: Keep a secure backup of these keys in case you need to recover them (e.g., if the application needs to be redeployed).
- **Document Key Rotation Policies**: Define and document how often the keys should be rotated and the procedure for doing so.

### 5. **Avoid Hardcoding**
- **Do Not Hardcode**: Avoid hardcoding the keys in your application code to reduce the risk of exposure. Always retrieve them from environment variables or a secure vault.

### Conclusion
In summary, using separate keys for `SECRET_KEY` and `UTILS_SECRET` is advisable, and they should be recorded securely using appropriate practices. This approach enhances security, helps in managing risks effectively, and ensures that your application remains robust against potential vulnerabilities.
