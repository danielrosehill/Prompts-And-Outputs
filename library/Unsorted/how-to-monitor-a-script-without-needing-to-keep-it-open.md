# Prompt

Is there a way to run a bash script on a linux server ina  way that lets me verify that it's running by viewing the output, but which also allows me to close the terminal without interrupting the script?

# Output

Yes, you can run a bash script on a Linux server in a way that allows you to:

1. **View the output in real time** to verify it's running.
2. **Close the terminal without interrupting the script**.

The best ways to achieve this are:

### 1. **Using `screen`**:
`screen` allows you to run a script inside a terminal session that persists even after you close the terminal.

#### Steps:
1. **Install screen** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   sudo apt install screen  # For Debian/Ubuntu
   sudo yum install screen  # For CentOS/RHEL
   ```

2. **Start a new screen session**:
   ```bash
   screen -S mysession
   ```

3. **Run your bash script**:
   ```bash
   ./yourscript.sh
   ```

4. **Detach from the screen session** (leaving the script running):
   Press `Ctrl + A`, then `D`.

5. **To reattach later** and see the output:
   ```bash
   screen -r mysession
   ```

6. **To close the session** once the script is done:
   When you're done viewing or the script is finished, exit the session by typing `exit`.

### 2. **Using `tmux`**:
`tmux` is similar to `screen` and offers a more modern and flexible way to manage terminal sessions.

#### Steps:
1. **Install tmux**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install tmux  # For Debian/Ubuntu
   sudo yum install tmux  # For CentOS/RHEL
   ```

2. **Start a new tmux session**:
   ```bash
   tmux new -s mysession
   ```

3. **Run your script**:
   ```bash
   ./yourscript.sh
   ```

4. **Detach from the session**:
   Press `Ctrl + B`, then `D`.

5. **Reattach to the session**:
   ```bash
   tmux attach -t mysession
   ```

### 3. **Using `nohup` (without terminal attachment)**:
`nohup` allows you to run a script in the background and continue running even after you close the terminal. It doesn't allow you to view real-time output easily, but you can access the logs.

#### Steps:
1. **Run your script using `nohup`** and redirect output to a file:
   ```bash
   nohup ./yourscript.sh > output.log 2>&1 &
   ```

2. **Close the terminal** safely, and the script will keep running in the background.

3. **View the output**:
   ```bash
   tail -f output.log
   ```

Each method lets you safely close the terminal without interrupting the script, while still being able to check the progress of your running script. `screen` and `tmux` are ideal if you want to easily view real-time output and reattach to sessions, while `nohup` is simpler if you only need basic background execution.
