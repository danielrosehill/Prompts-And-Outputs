# Prompt

My ISP router is at 192.168.1.101. I don't have root access to the machine. But is there any way to probe the hardware without that? I'd like to determine the exact model name and manufacturer if possible

# Output

Without **root access** to the ISP router, your ability to extract detailed hardware information is limited. However, you can still **probe some basic details** about the router, including its model name and manufacturer, using several techniques. Here are some ways you can do this:

### 1. **Access the Router’s Web Interface**
- Most ISP routers have a **web-based interface** where you can find hardware details.
- **How to Access**:
  1. Open a browser and enter the router's IP address (`http://192.168.1.101`).
  2. If you have the credentials, log in to access the dashboard.
  3. Look for **System Information**, **Device Info**, or **About**—these sections often contain the **model number**, **firmware version**, and **manufacturer** details.
  
### 2. **Using SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol)**
- If SNMP is enabled on the router, you can use tools like **snmpwalk** or **snmpget** to retrieve information about the router.
- **Command Example**:
  ```bash
  snmpwalk -v 2c -c public 192.168.1.101
  ```
- **Note**: This command attempts to connect using community string `public`. This may need to be adjusted based on the configuration. It may not work if SNMP is disabled or configured differently on the router.

### 3. **Use Nmap to Discover the Device**
- **Nmap** can be used to probe the router and potentially extract information such as the device manufacturer or type.
- **Command**:
  ```bash
  nmap -A 192.168.1.101
  ```
- **Explanation**: The `-A` flag enables OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute. This can give you clues about the router's make and model.

### 4. **MAC Address Lookup**
- You can determine the **manufacturer** using the **MAC address** of the router. Every network device has a unique MAC address, and the first three octets correspond to the manufacturer.
- **How to Find the MAC Address**:
  - Use the **ARP table** on your local machine:
    ```bash
    arp -a
    ```
    Look for the entry corresponding to `192.168.1.101`.
- **Use a MAC Address Lookup Tool**:
  - Use an online tool like [MAC Address Lookup](https://macvendors.com/):
    - Enter the first three octets of the MAC address (e.g., `00:1A:2B`), and it will tell you the **manufacturer**.

### 5. **UPnP Discovery**
- If **UPnP (Universal Plug and Play)** is enabled, you can use a tool like **upnpc** to discover device information.
- **Command Example**:
  ```bash
  upnpc -l
  ```
- **Explanation**: This command will attempt to list all UPnP devices on the network, and you may get information about the router, including its model name.

### 6. **Router Packaging or ISP Documentation**
- Sometimes, your ISP provides documentation for the router, either on their website or in printed materials. The **model number** is often included in these documents.
- Alternatively, if you have access to the **router packaging**, it typically includes the model name and manufacturer.

### Summary
- **Web Interface**: Check the router’s web admin page for model information.
- **SNMP**: Probe the router using `snmpwalk` if SNMP is enabled.
- **Nmap Scan**: Use `nmap -A 192.168.1.101` to identify potential information.
- **MAC Address Lookup**: Use the MAC address to find the manufacturer.
- **UPnP**: Use `upnpc -l` to discover devices.
  
These methods should help you find the model name and manufacturer of the router without needing root access. Let me know if you need help with any of these steps!
