is there a modern / digital equivalent of the pager? A cross-platform software that runs on everything conceivable and which is intended solely for receiving urgent notifications. With the capability to integrate with tools like Zapier, webhooks, etc?

I apologize for the confusion. Let's narrow down the list to tools that have confirmed clients for both Fedora Linux and Android:

1. Pushover





# Pushover for Fedora and Android

Pushover is a lightweight notification service that offers support for both Fedora Linux and Android, making it an excellent "digital pager" equivalent.

Pushover's cross-platform support and simplicity make it a solid choice for users needing urgent notifications on both Fedora Linux and Android devices.


Pushover stands out as the best option meeting your specific requirements. It has a native Android app and an open-source desktop client that works on Fedora Linux.

2. Matrix/Element

While not designed specifically for urgent notifications, Matrix is an open protocol with clients like Element that support both Fedora Linux and Android. It can be configured for critical alerts:

- Element Desktop works on Fedora Linux
- Element Android app available on Google Play Store
- Can be self-hosted for more control
- Supports end-to-end encryption
- Allows for custom integrations through bots and bridges

3. Slack

Slack has clients for both Fedora Linux and Android. While it's a more general communication tool, it can be configured for urgent notifications:

- Native Slack client for Linux works on Fedora
- Slack app available on Google Play Store for Android
- Supports custom notification settings and priority messages
- Integrates with many third-party services and supports custom webhooks

These are the options that best fit your criteria of having clients for both Fedora Linux and Android, while also offering capabilities for urgent notifications and integrations with other tools.

Pushover is the most focused on the "digital pager" concept, while Matrix/Element and Slack offer broader communication features that can be adapted for urgent notifications.
