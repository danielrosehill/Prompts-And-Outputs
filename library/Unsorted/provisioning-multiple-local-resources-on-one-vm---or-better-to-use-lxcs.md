There are two main approaches you could consider when **self-hosting resources on your Ubuntu server** that you want to access from outside your local network: **provisioning unique local IPs** for each service or using **Linux Containers (LXCs)** to isolate applications.

Let's evaluate both options based on ease of use, flexibility, and security:

### Option 1: **Provisioning Resources with Unique Local IPs on the Same Host VM**
You can provision multiple services on the same Ubuntu server by assigning them **unique local IP addresses** or using different ports, all within the same VM. This method keeps everything within the same operating environment but might get a bit complicated when managing many services.

#### Approaches to Assign Unique Local IPs:
1. **Using Multiple Network Interfaces (Virtual NICs)**
   - You can configure **virtual network interfaces** on the Ubuntu host VM and assign a unique local IP address to each interface. Each service can then bind to its own IP and port.
   - This method allows you to isolate services somewhat by IP address, but all services still run on the same VM.

   **Steps**:
   - Use **Netplan** (or another networking tool) to configure multiple IP addresses:
     ```yaml
     network:
       version: 2
       ethernets:
         ens3:
           dhcp4: no
           addresses:
             - 192.168.1.10/24
             - 192.168.1.11/24
     ```
   - Once configured, you can assign each service to its respective IP address by configuring the service to bind to that IP.

2. **Binding Services to Specific Ports on One IP**
   - Instead of provisioning multiple IP addresses, you can run multiple services on the same IP but bind each service to a **different port**.
   - For example:
     - **App1**: `192.168.1.10:8080`
     - **App2**: `192.168.1.10:9090`

   **How to do it**:
   - In each application’s configuration file, specify a different port for each service.
   - You can then use **Nginx** or **HAProxy** as a reverse proxy to route requests based on subdomains or paths.

#### Pros and Cons of Using Multiple IPs:
- **Pros**:
  - Simpler to manage in terms of infrastructure (just one VM).
  - No need to manage multiple containers or images.
  
- **Cons**:
  - **Security and isolation**: All services are running on the same operating system instance. If one service is compromised, it may affect others.
  - **Resource allocation**: No resource limits or isolation for CPU/memory like in containers.
  - **Service management**: Managing multiple services in a single environment can become complex, especially with dependency management and software updates.

### Option 2: **Using Linux Containers (LXCs)**
**LXC (Linux Containers)** is a lightweight containerization solution that offers more isolation than running everything on a single host VM. Each service runs inside its own container, with its own file system, network configuration, and resource constraints. This approach is very efficient and often simpler to manage in the long run.

#### Benefits of Using LXCs:
- **Isolation**: Each application runs in its own container, offering **better security** and **isolation**. If one container is compromised, others are unaffected.
- **Resource Management**: You can assign resource limits to each container (CPU, memory, disk).
- **Flexibility**: Each LXC container can have its own unique IP address or share the host's IP with different ports.
- **Portability**: Containers can be moved between hosts easily.

#### How to Set Up LXCs for Each Application:
1. **Install LXC**:
   - First, install LXC on your Ubuntu server:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install lxd
     ```

2. **Initialize LXC/LXD**:
   - After installing, initialize **LXD** (the LXC daemon) to set up networking and storage:
     ```bash
     sudo lxd init
     ```

   - During initialization, you can create a **bridge network** that provides each container with its own unique local IP address (e.g., in the `192.168.1.0/24` subnet).

3. **Launch Containers**:
   - Create a new LXC container for each application:
     ```bash
     lxc launch ubuntu:20.04 app1-container
     lxc launch ubuntu:20.04 app2-container
     ```

   - You can then access each container via its **IP address** and run the applications inside them.

4. **Assign a Static IP Address** (Optional):
   - If you want each LXC to have a static IP address, you can configure the container’s network settings:
     ```bash
     lxc config device set app1-container eth0 ipv4.address 192.168.1.2
     lxc config device set app2-container eth0 ipv4.address 192.168.1.3
     ```

5. **Expose Services Externally**:
   - Once each container is running and has a unique IP, you can use **Nginx** or **HAProxy** on the host machine to act as a reverse proxy for external access to the containers.
   - You can set up subdomains or paths that point to different containers:
     ```nginx
     server {
         server_name app1.example.com;
         location / {
             proxy_pass http://192.168.1.2:80;  # Forward to the container's IP
         }
     }

     server {
         server_name app2.example.com;
         location / {
             proxy_pass http://192.168.1.3:80;
         }
     }
     ```

#### Pros and Cons of LXCs:
- **Pros**:
  - **Better isolation**: Each application is isolated in its own container.
  - **Easy management**: You can manage containers with LXD’s simple CLI.
  - **Scalability**: Containers are lightweight, so you can run multiple services with minimal overhead.
  - **Portability**: Containers can be easily exported and moved to different environments.

- **Cons**:
  - **Setup complexity**: Slightly more complex to set up initially, especially with networking configuration.
  - **Networking**: Managing networking across containers requires some planning, especially if you want to expose containers to external networks.

### Conclusion: **Which is Easier?**
- **Using LXCs** is generally a better approach if you want to isolate applications and improve security, scalability, and manageability. It's a bit more complex at the start but offers better long-term benefits in terms of isolation, resource control, and security.
  
- **Assigning unique IPs** to different services on the same VM can work for small-scale setups, but as the number of services grows, managing everything within a single environment can become unwieldy and prone to conflicts. It lacks the isolation that containers provide.

### Recommendation:
- **For long-term, scalable, and secure management of multiple applications**, use **LXCs**. Containers provide **better isolation**, **flexibility**, and are more portable, making them ideal for running multiple services on a single host.
