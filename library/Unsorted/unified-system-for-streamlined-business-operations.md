# Prompt

DR

I would like to develop a system for my business. I'm looking for a tool that I can self host and which can provide me with several essential functions in one package. One of these is a fully custom system for storing custom LLM agent configurations and recording prompt outputs. the other is a cloud native document management system (like google docs). And finally I will also need an invoicing and record keeping system. I don't think that there's any existing solution that meets all these needs, so I think that a builder framework for business tools might be the best direction. Can you suggest any tools and approaches?

# Output
You're right that there isn't a single existing solution that encompasses all the specific functionalities you're looking for. However, I can suggest a few approaches and tools that might help you build a custom system to meet your needs:

1. Low-code/No-code platforms:
   - Retool: A flexible platform for building internal tools quickly. It allows you to create custom interfaces and connect to various data sources.
   - Budibase: An open-source low-code platform that you can self-host. It's good for creating business applications and can connect to multiple databases.

2. Headless CMS with custom development:
   - Strapi: An open-source headless CMS that you can extend with custom plugins. It provides a good starting point for document management and can be customized for other functionalities.

3. Framework-based approach:
   - Next.js: A React-based framework that allows you to build full-stack web applications. It's highly customizable and can be used to create all the components you need.
   - Django: A Python web framework that provides a robust admin interface out of the box. It can be extended to handle document management, custom LLM configurations, and invoicing.

4. Microservices architecture:
   - You could build separate services for each major functionality (LLM management, document management, invoicing) and integrate them using an API gateway.
   - Tools like Docker and Kubernetes can help with deployment and scaling.

5. For the document management system specifically:
   - Collabora Online: An open-source office suite that can be integrated into your custom solution to provide Google Docs-like functionality.

6. For invoicing and record keeping:
   - Invoice Ninja: An open-source invoicing and billing system that you can self-host and potentially integrate with your custom solution.

Given your requirements, I would recommend starting with a framework-based approach using Next.js or Django. This would give you the flexibility to build custom functionalities while providing a solid foundation for web application development.

Here's a high-level approach you could take:

1. Set up a Next.js or Django project as your base.
2. Implement user authentication and authorization.
3. Create a custom module for LLM agent configurations and prompt output recording.
4. Integrate Collabora Online for document management.
5. Either integrate Invoice Ninja or build a custom invoicing module.
6. Use a database like PostgreSQL for data storage.
7. Implement an API layer to allow communication between different modules.

This approach would allow you to have full control over the system while leveraging existing tools where possible. It would require significant development effort, but it would result in a tailored solution that meets all your specific needs.

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific part of this approach or discuss alternative solutions?

# Prompt

  
It's great and I definitely do want to go with Postgres. The framework based approach makes sense. But I was still thinking that perhaps there's something like a "starter" framework for database backed projects that might cut down on development effort. Can you think of any?

# Output

You're absolutely right to look for a "starter" framework that could reduce development effort, especially for database-backed projects. There are indeed some excellent options that can provide a solid foundation and accelerate your development process. Here are a few that might fit your needs:

1. Supabase:




# Supabase

Supabase is an open-source Firebase alternative that provides a suite of tools for building database-backed applications.

- PostgreSQL Database: Fully managed and scalable.
- Authentication: Built-in user management and authentication.
- Realtime subscriptions: For building reactive applications.
- Storage: For managing large files like images and videos.
- Auto-generated APIs: RESTful and GraphQL APIs based on your database schema.
- Serverless Functions: Write custom logic in multiple languages.

## Advantages:
- Open-source and self-hostable
- Built on top of PostgreSQL
- Extensible with custom functions and triggers
- Strong developer community and growing ecosystem

## Potential Limitations:
- Learning curve for those new to PostgreSQL
- May require additional customization for very specific business logic

Supabase could serve as an excellent starting point for your project, providing many of the database and backend features you need out of the box.


Supabase could be an excellent foundation for your project. It provides a PostgreSQL database, authentication, storage, and auto-generated APIs, which could significantly reduce your development time.

2. Hasura:
Hasura is another powerful option. It's an open-source engine that gives you instant GraphQL APIs over PostgreSQL. It includes:
- Automatic CRUD APIs
- Real-time subscriptions
- Role-based access control
- Can be extended with serverless functions

3. Redwood.js:
Redwood is a full-stack JavaScript framework built on React, GraphQL, and Prisma. It's designed for building database-backed applications and includes:
- Built-in CLI for code generation
- Integrated testing and deployment
- Can work with various databases, including PostgreSQL

4. Blitz.js:
Blitz is built on Next.js and adds several features that make it great for database-backed applications:
- Zero-API data layer
- Built-in authentication
- Code scaffolding
- Works well with Prisma and PostgreSQL

5. Django + Django REST framework:
While not as "cutting-edge" as some other options, this combination provides a robust, battle-tested solution for building database-backed applications:
- Includes an ORM that works well with PostgreSQL
- Built-in admin interface
- Extensive ecosystem of packages
- REST API capabilities out of the box with DRF

Among these options, I would particularly recommend considering Supabase or Hasura if you're comfortable with PostgreSQL and want a solution that provides a lot of functionality out of the box. They both offer powerful features that align well with your requirements, including database management, API generation, and authentication.

If you prefer a more traditional web framework approach but still want to reduce development effort, Redwood.js or Blitz.js could be excellent choices, especially if you're comfortable with JavaScript and React.

Would you like more detailed information on any of these options or guidance on how to get started with one of them?

# Input

  
The idea of developing my own systems for invoicing makes me nervous and doesn't seem smart. Such systems already exist in abundance. Doesn't it make more sense to find a system that already has the core components I need and just focus on developing the additional things that I can't find?

# Output

You're absolutely right, and I apologize for not addressing that concern earlier. Your instinct is spot-on - it's generally much smarter and more efficient to leverage existing, well-tested systems for critical business functions like invoicing rather than reinventing the wheel. Let's pivot our approach to focus on finding a solid existing system that covers your core needs, which we can then extend or integrate with custom components for your unique requirements.





# Integrated Business Solutions with Custom Extensions

## Core System Options:
1. **Odoo**: Open-source ERP with modules for invoicing, document management, and more.
2. **ERPNext**: Another open-source ERP with a wide range of business modules.
3. **Nextcloud**: Primarily for document management, but has apps for other business functions.

## Integration Approach:
- Choose a core system for invoicing and document management
- Develop custom modules or integrations for LLM agent configurations and prompt outputs
- Use APIs or plugins to connect systems as needed

## Comparison:

| System    | Invoicing | Doc Management | Customization | Self-hosting |
|-----------|-----------|-----------------|---------------|--------------|
| Odoo      | ✅         | ✅               | High          | ✅            |
| ERPNext   | ✅         | ✅               | High          | ✅            |
| Nextcloud | ❌ (3rd party) | ✅           | Medium        | ✅            |

## Development Steps:
1. Set up chosen core system (e.g., Odoo)
2. Customize/configure for your specific invoicing and document needs
3. Develop custom module for LLM agent configurations
4. Integrate custom module with core system via APIs or as a plugin
5. Implement any additional custom features as needed


You're absolutely correct that it makes more sense to find an existing system that covers your core needs and then focus on developing the additional custom components. This approach will save you time, reduce potential errors, and allow you to benefit from well-established, tested systems for critical business functions like invoicing.

Based on your requirements, I'd recommend considering the following approach:

1. Core System: Consider using an open-source ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) system like Odoo or ERPNext. These systems provide robust invoicing, document management, and other business functionalities out of the box. They're also self-hostable and highly customizable.

   Odoo, for example, offers:
   - Invoicing and accounting modules
   - Document management
   - Customer relationship management (CRM)
   - Inventory management
   - And many more business applications

2. Custom Development: Once you have your core system in place, you can focus on developing the custom components for LLM agent configurations and prompt output recording. This could be done as a custom module within the chosen ERP system, or as a separate application that integrates with the ERP via APIs.

3. Integration: Use APIs or develop plugins to connect your custom LLM management system with the core ERP system. This way, you can have a unified interface for all your business operations.

This approach offers several advantages:
- You get a proven, reliable system for critical business functions like invoicing and document management.
- The core system will likely cover many other business needs you might have now or in the future.
- You can focus your custom development efforts on the unique aspects of your business (LLM management) rather than reinventing standard business processes.
- Open-source ERPs like Odoo are highly customizable, so you can tailor them to your specific needs.

To get started:
1. Evaluate Odoo, ERPNext, or similar open-source ERP systems to see which best fits your needs.
2. Set up a test instance of your chosen system and configure it for your basic invoicing and document management needs.
3. Plan out your custom LLM management module, considering how it will integrate with the core system.
4. Develop your custom module, either within the ERP framework or as a standalone application with API integration.

Would you like more details on any of these steps or systems? I can provide more specific guidance on setting up Odoo or ERPNext, or on approaches to developing and integrating your custom LLM management module.## ]
