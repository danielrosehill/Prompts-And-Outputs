# Prompt

There is a website I need to add to a dashbaord which can only be accessed from IPs in Israel. Are there any services that can create links that put a website behind a proxy?

# Output

Yes, there are services and methods that can help you access region-restricted websites by creating proxy links or setting up a proxy server. Here are a few approaches you could consider:

### 1. **Cloudflare Workers with Geolocation**
   - **Overview**: Cloudflare Workers allow you to deploy custom scripts at Cloudflare’s edge servers. You can set up a worker to act as a proxy for your website and restrict access to Israel-based IPs using Cloudflare's geolocation API.
   - **Usage**: Set up a Cloudflare Worker to fetch content from the restricted site. You can use geolocation rules to ensure the worker only proxies content for Israeli IP addresses. This option requires some scripting knowledge, but it’s a flexible solution.
   - **Cost**: Cloudflare Workers offer a free tier with up to 100,000 requests per day.

### 2. **VPN Service with Proxy Functionality**
   - **Overview**: Some VPN providers offer dedicated IPs and proxy services that can be configured to route traffic through a server in Israel.
   - **Examples**: Services like NordVPN and ExpressVPN offer dedicated IPs and can function as proxies. You can set up a VPN server in Israel, and configure it to act as a proxy, allowing you to embed links in a way that routes traffic through the Israeli IP.

### 3. **Self-Hosted Proxy Server on a VPS in Israel**
   - **Overview**: You could set up a self-hosted proxy server on a virtual private server (VPS) located in Israel. Tools like **Squid** or **Nginx** can be configured to proxy requests.
   - **Steps**:
     1. Purchase a VPS located in Israel (providers like AWS, DigitalOcean, or local Israeli VPS providers).
     2. Set up **Squid** or **Nginx** as a reverse proxy to forward requests to the restricted website.
     3. Configure access controls if needed to restrict who can use the proxy.
   - **Cost**: Costs vary based on the provider and the level of service, but basic VPS instances are generally affordable.

### 4. **Zyte (Formerly Crawlera)**
   - **Overview**: Zyte provides proxy services that allow you to route traffic through different locations globally. While they’re usually for web scraping, they can also be used to create links that access sites through IPs from specific countries.
   - **Usage**: Zyte offers proxy rotation with IP geolocation control, so you can specify Israeli IPs. They offer a free trial, but usage fees apply afterward.

### 5. **Smart DNS Proxy Services**
   - **Overview**: Smart DNS services like **Smart DNS Proxy** or **Unlocator** can route DNS requests through specific regions, enabling access to geo-restricted sites.
   - **Usage**: These services allow you to configure access through specific IP ranges, and while they are usually configured at the device level, they can be used to access region-restricted content.

If you’re comfortable with a bit of technical setup, the **Cloudflare Workers** and **self-hosted proxy** solutions can provide a high degree of control and customization for embedding the content into your dashboard. If you prefer a managed service with less configuration, a **VPN with proxy capabilities** or **Smart DNS Proxy** might be a good fit.
