# Prompt

You said:
I'm looking to host a custom dashboard for displaying a few live news websites and a security alert dashboard. I'm looking for a tool that will make it easy to design and host this dashboard. As I have a home server, I think it would be nice to build something on it so that I can create some local dashboards for different devices without needing to worry about people on the internet being able to see them. Can you recommend some tools that I can set up and deploy in my home?
