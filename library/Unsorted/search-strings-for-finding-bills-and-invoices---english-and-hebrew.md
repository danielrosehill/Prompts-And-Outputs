   subject:(bill OR invoice OR receipt OR payment) OR body:(bill OR invoice OR receipt OR payment)
   ```

2. **More Specific Terms (for variety):**
   ```bash
   subject:(statement OR billing OR charged OR due) OR body:(statement OR billing OR charged OR due)
   ```

### **Hebrew Search Strings:**
1. **General Bills and Invoices:**
   ```bash
