How about this idea? Creating a single PWA with built in auto rotation between a defined set of URLs? For Fedora

# Output

Creating a **single Progressive Web App (PWA)** that has a **built-in auto-rotation between defined URLs** is definitely an interesting and feasible approach! This can be done by leveraging **JavaScript** to automatically switch between different URLs within the PWA at a defined interval. Here's how you can create such a solution on **Fedora** (or any Linux distribution, really):

### Steps to Create a PWA with Auto-Rotation
1. **Set Up a Simple Web App Structure**:
   - You can create a simple web page using **HTML** and **JavaScript** that acts as a PWA.
   - This web app will load and auto-rotate between a set of URLs.

2. **HTML and JavaScript to Handle Rotation**:
   - You can define a list of URLs in JavaScript and use a timer function to switch between them at specified intervals (e.g., every 30 seconds).
   
   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html lang="en">
   <head>
       <meta charset="UTF-8">
       <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
       <link rel="manifest" href="manifest.json">
       <title>Auto-Rotating PWA</title>
   </head>
   <body>
       <iframe id="iframe" width="100%" height="100%"></iframe>
       <script>
           const urls = [
               'https://www.ynet.co.il',
               'https://www.haaretz.co.il',
               'https://www.timesofisrael.com',
               'https://www.jpost.com'
           ];

           let currentIndex = 0;

           function rotateUrls() {
               document.getElementById('iframe').src = urls[currentIndex];
               currentIndex = (currentIndex + 1) % urls.length;
           }

           setInterval(rotateUrls, 30000); // Switch every 30 seconds
           window.onload = rotateUrls; // Load the first URL immediately
       </script>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```
   - **Explanation**:
     - The **iframe** element is used to display the different URLs.
     - The **rotateUrls** function changes the `src` of the iframe, effectively switching between different URLs.
     - The `setInterval()` function ensures that URLs change every **30 seconds**.

3. **Make it a PWA**:
   - To make the web page a **Progressive Web App**, you need to add a **manifest file** and a **service worker**.
   - **manifest.json** (define your PWA details):
     ```json
     {
       "name": "Auto-Rotating Dashboard",
       "short_name": "Dashboard",
       "start_url": ".",
       "display": "standalone",
       "background_color": "#ffffff",
       "theme_color": "#000000",
       "icons": [
         {
           "src": "icon.png",
           "sizes": "192x192",
           "type": "image/png"
         }
       ]
     }
     ```
   - **Service Worker** (optional, for offline support):
     ```javascript
     self.addEventListener('install', (event) => {
         event.waitUntil(
             caches.open('pwa-cache').then((cache) => {
                 return cache.addAll([
                     './',
                     './index.html',
                     './manifest.json',
                     './icon.png'
                 ]);
             })
         );
     });

     self.addEventListener('fetch', (event) => {
         event.respondWith(
             caches.match(event.request).then((response) => {
                 return response || fetch(event.request);
             })
         );
     });
     ```

4. **Serve the PWA**:
   - To test the PWA locally, you can use **Python's simple HTTP server**:
     ```bash
     python3 -m http.server 8080
     ```
   - Once running, open **http://localhost:8080** in Chrome or any Chromium-based browser.
   - You can then **install** the PWA from the browser's **Install App** button in the address bar.

5. **Add as Desktop Shortcut**:
   - Once installed, the PWA can be launched like any other application, and it will automatically rotate between the defined URLs.

### Self-Hosting on Fedora
- If you want this PWA to be available for multiple devices, you could self-host it on a **Fedora** server.
- Use a web server like **Apache** or **Nginx** to serve the files:
  - Install **Apache**:
    ```bash
    sudo dnf install httpd
    sudo systemctl start httpd
    sudo systemctl enable httpd
    ```
  - Place your PWA files in `/var/www/html/`, and youâ€™ll be able to access them via your server's IP address or domain.

### GUI Tools for PWA Creation
- Currently, creating a custom PWA like this generally requires manual coding and configuration. However, there are tools like **PWA Builder**:
  - **PWA Builder**: [https://www.pwabuilder.com/](https://www.pwabuilder.com/)
    - This is a helpful website that simplifies turning a website into a PWA by generating the manifest and service worker for you.
  
### Advantages of This Approach
- **Custom Control**: You can modify the rotation interval, add more URLs, or even add conditions for when to switch.
- **Privacy**: Since you are self-hosting, the data is only accessible by you, which is ideal for sensitive dashboards.
- **Desktop App-Like Behavior**: The PWA can be installed and launched directly, behaving like a native application, making it easy to manage the monitoring.

### Conclusion
Creating a PWA with auto-rotation capabilities is an excellent way to have a **single dashboard** that switches between URLs automatically. On **Fedora**, you can host this on your local system or a server, allowing you to monitor all the important news sources and dashboards efficiently.

This solution is more **flexible** and **private** compared to browser extensions and offers you a lot of control over how and when to switch the views. Let me know if you'd like to explore any specific part of this in more detail, or need help setting it up!
