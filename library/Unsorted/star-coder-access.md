There are several ways to access and use StarCoder:

1. Hugging Face API:
StarCoder is available through the Hugging Face API. You can use the API endpoint https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/bigcode/starcoder/ to interact with the model programmatically[3]. This allows you to integrate StarCoder into your applications or workflows.

2. Local Deployment:
You can download and run StarCoder locally using libraries like Hugging Face's Transformers. This gives you full control over the model but requires more computational resources[3].

3. NVIDIA AI Foundation Models and Endpoints:
NVIDIA provides access to StarCoder2 (an updated version of StarCoder) through their AI Foundation Models and Endpoints. You can use their API to interact with the model after signing up for an NGC catalog account and obtaining an API key[4].

4. VS Code Extension:
StarCoder is available as a VS Code extension called StarCoderEx, which allows you to use the model directly within your development environment[6].

5. Open-Source Implementation:
As an open-source model, you can find StarCoder's code and model weights on the Hugging Face model hub (https://huggingface.co/bigcode/starcoder). This allows you to study, modify, or fine-tune the model for your specific needs[5].

6. Commercial Services:
Some AI platforms and code assistance tools may incorporate StarCoder or its derivatives into their offerings, providing an indirect way to access its capabilities.

When choosing how to access StarCoder, consider factors such as your technical requirements, computational resources, integration needs, and whether you need local deployment or are comfortable with cloud-based solutions. The Hugging Face API or NVIDIA's offering might be the most straightforward options if you're looking for quick integration without managing the infrastructure yourself.
