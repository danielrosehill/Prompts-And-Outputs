Ah, I understand now—you're specifically interested in tools designed for **media monitoring**, allowing you to watch and aggregate **news feeds and live TV broadcasts** that are publicly available, rather than tools for broadcasting or managing your own streams. Let me provide some alternatives that focus on **media monitoring** specifically, especially for **live TV feeds and online news content**:

### Media Monitoring Tools for Live TV and News Feeds

1. **TVEyes**
   - **TVEyes** is a media monitoring tool that specifically focuses on **TV and radio broadcasts**. It allows you to search, view, and analyze broadcasts from multiple news channels in real-time or on-demand.
   - **Pros**: Direct access to news clips, automatic transcription, and searchable video content. Great for tracking breaking news and mentions across multiple channels.
   - **Cons**: Coverage depends on the region, and the platform might not allow true multi-view live feeds, but it allows you to easily access and watch relevant segments.
   - **Pricing**: **Starts at $99/month** (depending on the number of regions and content access).

2. **Meltwater**
   - **Meltwater** is a media monitoring tool that provides coverage across online news, social media, and broadcast content. It offers integration of traditional news with broadcast feeds and real-time alerts.
   - **Pros**: Comprehensive, integrates multiple sources (social, print, TV), and provides good visualization dashboards.
   - **Cons**: Primarily designed for broader PR monitoring, so it may lack a dedicated multiview for live TV.
   - **Pricing**: Typically starts around **$99/month**, but you may need to confirm the specific features included.

3. **Critical Mention**
   - **Critical Mention** is well-known in the media monitoring space and offers **real-time TV broadcast tracking**. It has a searchable database of news feeds and lets you track multiple TV channels across different regions.
   - **Pros**: Provides real-time alerts, has a robust database, and supports monitoring of live broadcast channels.
   - **Cons**: May not have a multi-window view for watching all the streams live simultaneously, but it's good for keeping track of different channels.
   - **Pricing**: Around **$89/month** (depending on features).

4. **Grabyo**
   - **Grabyo** is not strictly a monitoring tool but can be used to watch and record live TV feeds. It’s a cloud-based platform that allows access to live streams and broadcasts.
   - **Pros**: Access multiple channels, share clips, and save segments for later analysis.
   - **Cons**: Not a traditional media monitoring tool, more focused on enabling interaction with the streams.
   - **Pricing**: Typically **$79/month** for entry-level plans that include monitoring capabilities.

5. **Talkwalker**
   - **Talkwalker** offers media monitoring across social media, web, and some TV and radio feeds. It provides dashboards to follow the latest trends and integrates with some TV content.
   - **Pros**: Combines insights from multiple sources, offers powerful analytics, and custom dashboards.
   - **Cons**: Primarily focused on social media with TV content as a secondary option, so live TV monitoring may be somewhat limited.
   - **Pricing**: Starts at **$96/month** for basic monitoring, but may vary based on the package.

### Summary
- **TVEyes** is likely the most **direct solution** for monitoring live TV broadcasts, with real-time search and easy access to clips.
- **Critical Mention** also offers **TV and radio broadcast tracking**, ideal for comprehensive coverage.
- **Meltwater** and **Talkwalker** are more **integrated media solutions**, combining social, online news, and TV feeds into one view—useful if you're looking for more than just live TV.
- **Grabyo** is a **more flexible tool** for interacting with live feeds, allowing clipping and sharing but lacks the pure "monitoring" functionality.

If you're specifically looking for the ability to **watch multiple live news feeds** simultaneously in a media monitoring context, **TVEyes** or **Critical Mention** could be the best fit under $100/month. 

Do any of these seem closer to what you're looking for, or would you like more details on a particular tool?
