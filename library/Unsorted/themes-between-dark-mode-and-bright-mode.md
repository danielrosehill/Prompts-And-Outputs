**Prompt Summary:** You are asking if there are themes or visual setups in KDE Plasma that are somewhere between dark mode and tiling mode.

---

Yes, there are ways to achieve a visual setup on KDE Plasma that combines the aesthetics of dark mode with the functional aspects of tiling. This can involve themes that offer a hybrid appearance or window management tweaks that create a more organized, tiling-inspired layout. Here are some approaches you can consider:

### **1. Hybrid Themes with Dark Accents**
   - **Description:** These are themes that provide a dark mode look but also emphasize clean, minimalist design elements, helping to organize window borders and application areas, somewhat emulating a tiling layout.
   - **Recommended Themes:**
     - **Breeze Dark with Light Accents:** The standard **Breeze Dark** theme can be customized to have more defined window borders and highlights, which makes it easier to distinguish between tiled or overlapping windows. You can do this by adjusting the **Window Decoration** and **Color Scheme**.
     - **Arc-Dark or Arc-Dark Transparent:** The **Arc** theme family has variations that add transparency or slightly lighter accents to a dark theme, giving a polished look that is easy on the eyes and still functional. These themes help create a clear distinction between different windows, even when tiling.
     - **Nord KDE:** **Nord** is a popular color scheme that uses cool, dark blues with subtle light accents. It’s dark but not purely black, creating a smooth visual experience that pairs well with tiling layouts.

### **2. Window Management and Decoration Tweaks**
   - **Add Visual Separation:** Enhance the visual distinction of your windows even in dark mode by tweaking the **Window Decorations** settings.
     - **Title Bars and Shadows:** Choose decorations that add a thin border around windows or shadows to improve visual separation. This is useful when tiling or stacking windows close together.
     - **Breeze Enhanced:** Search for enhanced or modified versions of the default Breeze decoration that add more noticeable borders.

### **3. Transparent Dark Themes**
   - **Description:** Adding transparency can create a hybrid look where the dark mode is softened, and overlapping or tiled windows become more discernible. This effect can mimic the feel of a tiling setup by giving a lighter sense of layering.
   - **Examples:**
     - **Sweet Dark Transparent:** This theme combines dark mode with a soft, transparent background, making the desktop feel less closed-off and more open. It works nicely when managing multiple windows.
     - **Materia Dark Transparent:** Part of the **Materia** theme collection, this version uses transparency to add depth and make tiling or overlapping windows feel less cluttered.
     - **Kvantum Engine Themes:** Install **Kvantum**, a theme engine that allows for highly customized window appearances. You can find Kvantum themes with light transparency and dark elements, giving a soft blend between dark mode and tiling-like appearance.

### **4. Using Latte Dock with a Tilting Effect**
   - **Description:** **Latte Dock** can provide a visual organization to your desktop by letting you dock applications and manage window positions more cleanly. You can combine it with dark mode to have a dynamic but minimalist interface.
   - **Configurations:**
     - **Dynamic Transparency:** Adjust the transparency settings of Latte Dock so it adapts to your background, giving you a more fluid, visually appealing layout.
     - **Pinned Windows:** Pin frequently-used applications to specific spots in the dock, creating a pseudo-tiling effect where your key apps are always visible and accessible.

### **5. Tiling Extensions and Widgets**
   - **Description:** Although not themes, there are **KWin Scripts** and **Plasmoids** (widgets) that introduce tiling features, which can be paired with dark mode themes for a cleaner look.
   - **Examples:**
     - **Bismuth:** An advanced KWin script that mimics traditional tiling window managers, but with more customization. It allows you to tile windows in a set pattern, and combined with dark themes, it can give a structured feel to your desktop.
     - **Krohnkite:** Another tiling script for KDE Plasma. It adds dynamic tiling similar to i3 and works well with dark themes to organize space better.

### **Combining the Effects**
1. **Select a Dark Theme with Light Accents:** Choose a theme that isn't purely black but has soft contrasts, making it easy to distinguish between different areas of the screen.
2. **Enable Transparency Effects:** Add slight transparency to the windows so that overlapping or adjacent windows give a sense of depth.
3. **Use Window Decorations to Add Visual Separation:** Customize your window borders, colors, and shadows to make sure each window stands out.
4. **Add a Tiling Script or Extension:** Combine with **Bismuth** or **Krohnkite** to have tiling behavior, allowing you to see all windows at once without overlaps, which goes well with dark themes.

### **Conclusion**
For a look that’s between dark mode and tiling mode, aim for a **clean, dark theme** with **visual enhancements** that separate window elements. **Nord**, **Arc-Dark Transparent**, or **Sweet Dark** are good starting points. Enhancing KDE’s built-in tiling mode or using extensions like **Bismuth** can help tie it all together, making for an aesthetic but functional workspace.
