# Output

For displaying auto-refreshing news headlines about Israel on digital displays or dashboards, there are a few solutions designed specifically for these needs:

### 1. **The Times of Israel**
   - Although The Times of Israel does not provide an embed widget, it does offer an RSS feed that can be integrated into many digital signage systems. Using a digital signage platform that supports RSS feeds, you can display the latest headlines from their [Israel news section](https://www.timesofisrael.com/) and set it to auto-refresh for real-time updates【81†source】【82†source】.

### 2. **VuePilot**
   - VuePilot is a digital signage software designed for business and information displays. It supports automated content rotation, meaning you can schedule different types of content, including live news headlines, to display in a loop. While VuePilot doesn’t directly offer news, it has integrations that can pull in news feeds and cycle through them on your screens. You can configure VuePilot to display specific webpages or embed news feeds that refresh automatically. More information on VuePilot can be found on their [official website](https://www.vuepilot.com/)【83†source】.

### 3. **LeadStory**
   - LeadStory integrates with VuePilot to provide curated news content that can be displayed in digital signage. This solution could be particularly useful for embedding and rotating news content relevant to Israel and the Middle East. LeadStory can be set up to pull headlines from various news sources and present them on digital screens, which would allow for automatic toggling between headlines【85†source】.

These options allow you to set up news feeds and webpages for rotating display, ensuring your digital signage displays stay current with the latest news on Israel and the region. Depending on your setup, you can use RSS feeds or opt for specialized digital signage solutions like VuePilot to cycle through various sources.
