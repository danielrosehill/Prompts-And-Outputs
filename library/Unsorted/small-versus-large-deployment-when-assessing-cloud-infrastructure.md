A "small deployment" in the context of hosting an application like Outline KM, particularly when discussing the configuration of resources and anticipated usage, typically involves the following characteristics:

### Characteristics of a Small Deployment

1. **User Base**:
   - **Single User or Small Team**: The deployment is primarily for personal use or a small team (e.g., 1-5 users) where usage patterns are low.

2. **Workload**:
   - **Limited Activity**: The application does not have high concurrent usage. For example, users might access it a few times daily for reading or making occasional updates.
   - **Non-Critical Applications**: The knowledge management tool is not mission-critical, meaning that temporary downtime is acceptable.

3. **Resource Requirements**:
   - **Basic Features**: Utilizing basic features of the application without heavy data processing or complex integrations (e.g., no extensive third-party API calls or large file uploads).
   - **Low Database Size**: The PostgreSQL database is relatively small, containing only a few hundred to a few thousand records, with limited multimedia content.

4. **Performance Expectations**:
   - **Moderate Performance Needs**: Users expect reasonable response times but are not demanding high availability or performance under heavy load. For example, occasional slow responses during peak usage might be acceptable.

5. **Deployment Scale**:
   - **Single VM Setup**: Everything (the application and the database) runs on a single VM, typically with lower-tier resources (like 2 vCPUs and 2 GB RAM), which is sufficient for handling the light load.

### Example Metrics for Small Deployment
- **Concurrent Users**: 1 to 5 active users at any given time.
- **Database Size**: 1 GB or less.
- **Traffic Volume**: A few dozen requests per hour, with the application primarily accessed during specific times (e.g., work hours).
- **Data Changes**: Occasional updates or edits to knowledge entries rather than frequent modifications.

### Conclusion
In summary, a small deployment for Outline KM typically involves light usage scenarios with a limited number of users, modest workload requirements, and a simple configuration that leverages a single VM. This setup allows for easy management and lower costs while meeting the needs of a personal or small team knowledge management solution.
