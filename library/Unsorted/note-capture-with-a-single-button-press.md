# Prompt

I'm using Obsidian to store LLM outputs. I would ideally like to have the ability to press a single button on my keyboard which would:

- Create a new note with a specific template which is saved in Templater

So far I haven't been able to achieve this. I can configure a hotkey to create a new note using a Templater template, but it takes me to a template selection dropdown that I have to pass through

Is it possible to achieve what I want in one single button press?

# Output

To achieve the functionality of creating a new note with a specific template in Obsidian using a single button press, you can utilize the Templater plugin along with some configuration. Hereâ€™s how you can set it up:

## Steps to Create a New Note with a Specific Template Using a Single Hotkey

### 1. Install Necessary Plugins

- **Templater**: Ensure that the Templater plugin is installed and enabled in your Obsidian setup. This plugin allows for advanced templating capabilities.
- **QuickAdd** (Optional): This plugin can further automate and streamline the process.

### 2. Configure Templater

- **Template Setup**: Save your desired template in the Templater folder within your Obsidian vault.
- **Assign Hotkey**: In Templater settings, add your specific template to the "Template Hotkeys" section. This creates a command specifically for your template[2].

### 3. Create a Hotkey for Your Template

- Go to Obsidian's settings and navigate to the "Hotkeys" section.
- Search for the command related to your specific template (e.g., "Templater: Create new note from [Your Template Name]").
- Assign a hotkey to this command, ensuring it doesn't conflict with existing shortcuts[5].

### 4. Automate Note Creation

- Use the `tp.file.create_new()` function within Templater to automate the creation of a new note directly from the specified template without additional prompts[2].
  
  Example Templater script:
  ```markdown
  <%*
  const template = tp.file.find_tfile("YourTemplateName");
  await tp.file.create_new(template, "NewNoteName", true);
  %>
  ```

### 5. Use QuickAdd for Enhanced Automation (Optional)

- If using QuickAdd, configure it to create notes in specific folders with predefined templates, further streamlining the process[1][6].

### Conclusion

By following these steps, you can efficiently create new notes using a specific template with just one button press in Obsidian. This setup eliminates the need for manual selection from dropdowns, thereby enhancing your workflow efficiency.
