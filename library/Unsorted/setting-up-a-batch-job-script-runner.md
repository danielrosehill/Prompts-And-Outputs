# Prompt
Here's the path to the script for taking backups of my repo state /home/daniel/Git/Scripts/masterghrepo/Desktop/repo-layout.sh Let's set up a script called desktop-jobs.sh and add that first Then, let's add it to a crontab It should run every 6 hours and it's missed (because the system is off) it can run at next boot

# Output

To set up the **`desktop-jobs.sh`** script and add the backup script (`repo-layout.sh`) to it, followed by setting up the **crontab** to run every 6 hours and at boot, hereâ€™s the step-by-step process:

### 1. Create `desktop-jobs.sh` Script

This script will serve as your "master" script for executing various tasks, starting with the backup job (`repo-layout.sh`).

#### Step 1: Create the `desktop-jobs.sh` script
Create the script at `/home/daniel/Git/Scripts/masterghrepo/Desktop/desktop-jobs.sh`.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Run the Git repository layout backup script
echo "[INFO] Running the Git repo layout backup script..."
/home/daniel/Git/Scripts/masterghrepo/Desktop/repo-layout.sh
```

#### Step 2: Make the script executable
Make sure the `desktop-jobs.sh` script is executable.

```bash
chmod +x /home/daniel/Git/Scripts/masterghrepo/Desktop/desktop-jobs.sh
```

### 2. Set Up Crontab to Run Every 6 Hours

We can use **`cron`** to schedule the `desktop-jobs.sh` script to run every 6 hours. We also want it to run after boot if it was missed while the system was off.

#### Step 1: Open crontab for editing

Run the following command to edit the crontab:

```bash
crontab -e
```

#### Step 2: Add the cron job entry

Add the following line to the crontab file to schedule the job every 6 hours and ensure it runs after boot if it was missed:

```bash
# Run the desktop-jobs.sh script every 6 hours
0 */6 * * * /home/daniel/Git/Scripts/masterghrepo/Desktop/desktop-jobs.sh

# Run at system boot if the job was missed
@reboot /home/daniel/Git/Scripts/masterghrepo/Desktop/desktop-jobs.sh
```

### Explanation:
- `0 */6 * * *`: This tells cron to run the script every 6 hours, on the hour.
- `@reboot`: Ensures the script runs at system boot if it was missed while the system was off.

### 3. Verify Crontab

After adding the crontab entry, you can list your cron jobs to ensure it's set up correctly:

```bash
crontab -l
```

This should display your newly added cron job for the `desktop-jobs.sh` script.

---

### Summary:
- **`desktop-jobs.sh`**: Runs the backup script and can be expanded to include more tasks in the future.
- **Crontab**: Runs the script every 6 hours, and also after system boot if it was missed.

Now, your backup script will run every 6 hours and also be triggered at boot if missed! Let me know if you need any adjustments or additional scripts.
