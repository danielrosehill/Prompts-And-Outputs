**Prompt Summary:** You asked for ways to watermark PDFs, specifically for tools compatible with Fedora or web UIs, to stamp documents with labels like "private."

### Fedora-Compatible Tools for Watermarking PDFs

1. **PDFtk**
   - **Description:** A versatile command-line tool for manipulating PDFs. You can use it to add watermarks by overlaying one PDF onto another.
   - **Watermarking Command:**
     ```bash
     pdftk input.pdf stamp watermark.pdf output output.pdf
     ```
   - **Installation:**
     ```bash
     sudo dnf install pdftk
     ```
   - **How It Works:** Create a separate PDF (e.g., with the word "private") and use `pdftk` to overlay it as a watermark onto your existing document.

2. **qpdf**
   - **Description:** Another command-line tool for managing PDFs. While qpdf doesnâ€™t directly add watermarks, it can be combined with other tools like `pdfjam` or `pdftk` for the same purpose.
   - **Installation:**
     ```bash
     sudo dnf install qpdf
     ```
   - **Use Case:** Can be used to split, merge, and manipulate PDFs before applying a watermark with other tools.

3. **ImageMagick**
   - **Description:** Although primarily an image manipulation tool, ImageMagick can convert PDFs to images, overlay a watermark, and then convert them back.
   - **Watermarking Command:**
     ```bash
     convert input.pdf -gravity Center -pointsize 50 -draw "text 0,0 'PRIVATE'" output.pdf
     ```
   - **Installation:**
     ```bash
     sudo dnf install ImageMagick
     ```
   - **Note:** This method rasterizes the PDF, which may affect quality if fine text is involved.

4. **LibreOffice Draw**
   - **Description:** LibreOffice's drawing application can open PDFs, allowing you to add text or images as watermarks and then save the file as a PDF again.
   - **How It Works:**
     1. Open the PDF in LibreOffice Draw.
     2. Add text (e.g., "PRIVATE") or an image as a watermark.
     3. Save or export the modified file as a new PDF.
   - **Installation:**
     ```bash
     sudo dnf install libreoffice
     ```
