You asked about split-screen apps for your Android A7 tablet. Fortunately, the device should support split-screen functionality natively, but if you'd like more control or alternatives, here are some apps that can help with multitasking and split-screen use:

1. Floating Apps (Multitasking): This app allows you to open multiple floating windows, so you can use multiple apps simultaneously without needing a native split-screen feature.


2. Split Screen Shortcut: This app provides a quick shortcut to enable split-screen mode for apps that support it. Itâ€™s lightweight and easy to use.


3. Split Screen Launcher: This app allows you to create shortcuts that will launch two apps in split-screen mode with a single tap.


4. Edge Screen - Sidebar Launcher: This app adds an edge panel that lets you quickly open apps in split-screen or in pop-up mode for easier multitasking.



These apps should give you more flexibility and options for managing multitasking on your tablet.
