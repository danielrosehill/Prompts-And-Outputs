# Prompt

I've mentioned that I have the idea of creating a contextual repository in my Obsidian vault for storing LLM outputs. I want to create a series of files that can (ideally) be synthesised when I need to provide a new LLM with detailed context about me and my projects. I'm also interested in using this approach to enhance my prompting related to my job. For instance - I'd like (at a minimum) to have some contextual documents outlining my job responsibilities, details about my boss, details about our meeting cadence, etc. I'm going to work on this tomorrow and I'd like to pay particular attention to the second part of this project. 

Can you please provide me with a "to do list"

Firstly, please give me a list of context documents to draft to get both aspects of my folder going

Secondly provide short descriptions for items to include in both.
