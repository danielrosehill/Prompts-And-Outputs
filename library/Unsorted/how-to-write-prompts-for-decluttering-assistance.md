You’re looking to declutter your office but find it challenging to organize items like your rectangular metal boxes containing NFC tags. Since you're not comfortable with figuring out spaces and dimensions, you’re wondering whether you should set up a **custom GPT** for organizing and decluttering assistance or if writing prompts might be enough.

### Two Options: Custom GPT or Just Writing Prompts

#### 1. **Custom GPT for Decluttering Assistance**:
   - If you find yourself frequently needing advice for organizing and decluttering specific items (like where to store things, choosing containers, or arranging items), a **custom GPT** might be a good long-term solution. It could be trained to ask you detailed questions about your available space and items, then give tailored advice on storage solutions, organization strategies, and dimensions.
   - The custom GPT could also keep track of what you've organized already and suggest continuous improvements to your workspace.

   **Advantages**:
   - Personalized and consistent assistance over time.
   - You can save time by avoiding repeatedly explaining your needs, as the custom GPT will already know your preferences and setup.
   - Ideal if you plan to ask these types of questions regularly.

   **How to Set It Up**:
   - Define specific prompts or areas of concern (e.g., "How do I store small rectangular metal boxes?" or "What’s the best way to organize my desk with limited drawer space?").
   - Add routines, such as daily or weekly decluttering advice.

#### 2. **Writing Individual Prompts**:
   - You can also simply write individual prompts whenever you encounter specific problems. This might be sufficient if your questions are occasional and don’t require a highly detailed, ongoing process.
   - For instance, you could write a prompt like, “How can I store small rectangular metal boxes (about 10 cm x 5 cm x 3 cm) containing NFC tags in an organized way?” and get quick, specific advice on that issue.

   **Advantages**:
   - Quick, easy, and flexible. You don’t need to invest time setting up a custom GPT.
   - Useful for answering occasional or one-off questions without long-term commitments.

   **How to Use It**:
   - You can write prompts like, “I have a lot of small, random items that I don’t know how to store. What’s the best storage solution for rectangular metal boxes and small tech gadgets?”
   - I’ll provide you with suggestions based on your needs and space.

### Example Prompt for Decluttering:
Let’s start by focusing on the **NFC tags in metal boxes**. Here's how you might phrase it:

> "I have several small rectangular metal boxes, approximately 10 cm x 5 cm x 3 cm, that contain NFC tags. I’d like to store them more efficiently. What kind of container or storage solution would be suitable for organizing them, and where can I put this in my office?"

For this particular case, I could suggest a **drawer organizer** or **clear stackable bins** with labeled sections, which would allow you to keep the NFC tags organized and easy to access. I can help with additional questions about office organization and offer specific storage solutions tailored to your items and space constraints.

### My Recommendation:
If you find organizing and decluttering to be a frequent challenge and expect to need ongoing help, setting up a **custom GPT** could be a smart way to keep your workspace continuously optimized. However, if you only have occasional questions, simply writing individual prompts when you need help will work just fine.

Let me know how you'd like to proceed! If you want help with specific items or spaces, feel free to ask, and I can provide suggestions right away.
