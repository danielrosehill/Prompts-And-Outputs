Yes, in the scenario where you have one machine initiating the render (e.g., a laptop) and another machine performing the render (e.g., a dedicated local device), you would need **two render nodes** licensed if using a software like **V-Ray** for distributed rendering. 

In a **distributed rendering setup**:
- The **initiating machine** that manages the render would be considered a **node**, and
- Each **additional machine** participating in the rendering (performing the rendering calculations) would also require its own **render node license**.

Thus, you would need a **render node license** for the initiating laptop and a **second render node license** for the dedicated rendering device.

If you use **Autodesk's cloud rendering** service, local rendering doesn't typically require additional licenses. But with third-party tools like V-Ray, this would apply. Let me know if you want to dive deeper into the exact requirements for your setup!
