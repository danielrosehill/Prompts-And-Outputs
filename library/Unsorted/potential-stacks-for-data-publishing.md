### Summary of your prompt:
You are seeking minimalistic CMS options that could allow for the publishing of data visualizations in blogs or structured websites. You also want suggestions for simple stacks that integrate the CMS with data visualization tools, rationalizing the components where possible, and exploring whether the data visualization and CMS could share a database.

### Minimalistic CMS Options for Publishing Visualizations:

1. **Grav**:
   - **Description**: A flat-file CMS that is extremely lightweight and fast. It doesn't use a database, making it ideal for minimalistic setups.
   - **Suitability**: Perfect for embedding visualizations from tools like Metabase, Grafana, or Redash via iframe or links.
   - **Pros**: No database required, very fast, minimal setup, ideal for static content with embedded visualizations.

2. **Hugo**:
   - **Description**: Another flat-file CMS, Hugo is known for being fast and easy to deploy. It's a static site generator, ideal for blogs or structured websites where visualizations are embedded.
   - **Suitability**: Embedding visualization code (e.g., iframe or JSON data from APIs) into blog posts is seamless.
   - **Pros**: No database required, fast deployment, easily works with any visualization tool that outputs embeddable content.

3. **Ghost**:
   - **Description**: A simple, minimalistic CMS designed for publishing, with a built-in admin panel. It’s more structured than flat-file CMSes but remains lightweight.
   - **Suitability**: Can be paired with visualization tools and allows easy embedding of visualizations within blogs.
   - **Pros**: Lightweight, easy to set up, ideal for blogging and sharing visual insights.

4. **Jekyll**:
   - **Description**: Jekyll is a static site generator often paired with GitHub Pages. It’s minimalistic, and like Hugo, it generates static HTML, making it fast and simple.
   - **Suitability**: Ideal for embedding visualizations in structured posts.
   - **Pros**: No database needed, great for simple deployments, integrates well with GitHub.

### Stacks and Simple Deployment Strategies:

#### 1. **Grav + Metabase + SQLite (Optional)**
   - **CMS**: Grav (flat-file CMS, no database).
   - **Data Visualization**: Metabase (self-hosted, embeddable dashboards).
   - **Database**: SQLite for Metabase (optional).
   - **Rationale**: Grav is extremely lightweight and doesn’t require a database, while Metabase can handle data visualization from SQLite or any other database. This keeps the stack minimal, with only Metabase using a database.
   - **Deployment**: 
     - Host **Grav** and **Metabase** on the same server (e.g., GCP or DigitalOcean).
     - Share Metabase visualizations via iframe in Grav posts.
   - **Advantages**: Simple, fast setup. Only Metabase requires a database (SQLite is lightweight), and Grav remains lightweight and efficient.

#### 2. **Hugo + Grafana + PostgreSQL**
   - **CMS**: Hugo (static site generator).
   - **Data Visualization**: Grafana (with PostgreSQL as a backend).
   - **Database**: PostgreSQL (shared between Grafana and Hugo for structured data storage, if needed).
   - **Rationale**: Hugo generates static content, so there’s no need for a CMS database. Grafana handles the visualizations, pulling data from PostgreSQL. You can embed Grafana’s visualizations in Hugo pages using HTML/iframe.
   - **Deployment**: 
     - Deploy **Hugo** on a static site host (e.g., Netlify).
     - Deploy **Grafana** and **PostgreSQL** on a cloud service (e.g., Google Cloud).
     - PostgreSQL serves both Hugo (if structured content is needed) and Grafana for visualizations.
   - **Advantages**: The PostgreSQL database serves multiple purposes, keeping the stack efficient. Hugo's static site generation reduces complexity.

#### 3. **Ghost + Superset + MySQL**
   - **CMS**: Ghost (minimalistic, headless CMS with database).
   - **Data Visualization**: Apache Superset (self-hosted, embeddable visualizations).
   - **Database**: MySQL (shared between Ghost and Superset).
   - **Rationale**: Ghost’s simplicity makes it ideal for blog-style publishing, and Superset handles more complex visualizations. Both systems can share the same MySQL database.
   - **Deployment**: 
     - Host **Ghost** and **Superset** on the same server.
     - Use **MySQL** as the shared backend.
     - Embed Superset visualizations into Ghost posts or pages.
   - **Advantages**: Minimal duplication of resources, shared database between CMS and visualizations. Ghost allows easy management of content while embedding data insights.

#### 4. **Jekyll + Redash + SQLite**
   - **CMS**: Jekyll (static site generator).
   - **Data Visualization**: Redash (self-hosted, embeddable visualizations).
   - **Database**: SQLite (optional for Redash).
   - **Rationale**: Jekyll allows for simple static site generation, while Redash provides easy-to-embed visualizations from SQL databases. SQLite is used for Redash if lightweight needs arise.
   - **Deployment**: 
     - Jekyll hosted via **GitHub Pages** or similar.
     - Redash and **SQLite** hosted on a cloud platform (e.g., Google Cloud).
   - **Advantages**: Fast, static content from Jekyll, with Redash handling visualization and optionally using SQLite as a lightweight database.

### General Recommendations:
- **Shared Database**: For more dynamic CMSes (like Ghost), sharing the database with the visualization tool (e.g., MySQL for both Ghost and Superset) can reduce overhead and streamline management.
- **Minimalistic CMS**: Flat-file CMS options like **Grav** and **Hugo** reduce the need for a database at all, making them ideal for embedding visualizations with minimal overhead.
- **Static Site Generators**: **Hugo** and **Jekyll** simplify the frontend, allowing data visualization tools to handle the dynamic components.

This approach keeps the system lightweight while allowing you to build powerful, structured websites with data visualizations. Let me know if you want more details on setting up any of these stacks!
