Please help me to find an excellent knowledge management / wiki / note-taking tool.

Here are the functionalities I'm looking for:

- Seamless markdown support (you paste markdown and it instantly renders as text). I prefer a single editing pane than a split edit/preview interface.
- The ability to scale to lots of notes.
- SaaS / cloud-hosted
- A web UI and an Android app.
- A good backup functionality allowing you to regularly export your notes in your own storage

Features that would be great to have but are less essential:

- The ability to organise intelligently (or with AI) the knowledge that you are aggregating
- A graph or graph like functionality, allowing you to identify the connections in your knowledge

Please identify possible options and for each provide the monthly subscription price.
