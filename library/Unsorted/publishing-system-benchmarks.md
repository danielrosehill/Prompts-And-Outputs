# Prompt

Are there any benchmarking platforms which might allow me to publish my benchmarks? And might this data be of interest to anyone?

# Output

Yes, there are several benchmarking platforms where you can publish your benchmarks, particularly for your RAID1 setup, BTRFS filesystem performance, or even specific hardware components like your CPU or GPU. These platforms not only allow you to share performance data with the broader community but also enable others to compare their results and learn from your findings.

### Benchmarking Platforms to Publish Your Benchmarks

#### 1. **OpenBenchmarking.org**
   - **Platform Overview**: OpenBenchmarking.org is one of the most popular platforms for publishing and sharing Linux benchmarks. It’s integrated with the **Phoronix Test Suite**, a widely-used Linux benchmarking tool.
   - **How It Works**: After running benchmarks using the Phoronix Test Suite, you can upload and publish your results on OpenBenchmarking.org for others to see and compare.
   - **What You Can Benchmark**:
     - Disk I/O (ideal for RAID1 and BTRFS benchmarks).
     - CPU, GPU, memory, and system performance.
     - Custom workloads (e.g., compiling code, server workloads).
   - **Data of Interest**: Your RAID1 and BTRFS benchmarks would be particularly valuable to those interested in filesystem performance, RAID setups, and Linux performance tuning. The platform is widely used by enthusiasts and professionals in the Linux community.
   - **Website**: [OpenBenchmarking.org](https://www.openbenchmarking.org/)

#### 2. **UserBenchmark**
   - **Platform Overview**: UserBenchmark is another popular platform that allows users to benchmark their systems and compare their results with others. While it’s primarily focused on Windows, it does support some Linux setups.
   - **How It Works**: You run the UserBenchmark tool, which tests components like CPU, GPU, SSD, and HDD performance, then you can share your results on the platform.
   - **What You Can Benchmark**:
     - CPU, GPU, SSD/HDD (ideal for testing RAID1 performance).
   - **Data of Interest**: While UserBenchmark is more general-purpose and hardware-centric, RAID1 performance benchmarks (especially when compared across different SSDs or HDDs) could be interesting to users who are looking at system performance optimizations.
   - **Website**: [UserBenchmark](https://www.userbenchmark.com/)

#### 3. **PassMark PerformanceTest**
   - **Platform Overview**: PassMark is a popular tool and platform for benchmarking Windows, macOS, and Linux systems. It provides comprehensive benchmarks for CPU, disk, memory, and more.
   - **How It Works**: After running a series of tests using PassMark’s software, you can publish your results on their online database and compare them with others.
   - **What You Can Benchmark**:
     - Disk performance (including RAID arrays), CPU, memory, and GPU.
   - **Data of Interest**: RAID1 setups are often of interest to system administrators and those testing storage configurations for enterprise or personal use. Your benchmarks could provide insights into how specific hardware and configurations (like BTRFS with RAID1) perform.
   - **Website**: [PassMark](https://www.passmark.com/)

#### 4. **AnandTech Forums (Benchmarking & Testing Section)**
   - **Platform Overview**: While not a dedicated benchmarking platform, the **AnandTech Forums** have an active community focused on benchmarking and testing hardware. You can share your benchmarking results, methodologies, and performance insights directly with other tech enthusiasts.
   - **How It Works**: You can post your benchmarks, discuss your hardware setup, and compare your RAID1 and BTRFS performance with other users.
   - **What You Can Benchmark**: Anything hardware-related—especially disk performance, RAID configurations, and Linux performance.
   - **Data of Interest**: Benchmarks of RAID1 with BTRFS might be of interest to those comparing different RAID configurations or those focused on performance tuning with Linux filesystems.
   - **Website**: [AnandTech Forums](https://forums.anandtech.com/)

#### 5. **Geekbench Browser**
   - **Platform Overview**: Geekbench Browser allows users to publish their Geekbench test results for CPU and GPU performance. It’s often used to compare different hardware configurations across platforms.
   - **How It Works**: After running the Geekbench benchmark, you can upload your results to the Geekbench Browser to share with the public.
   - **What You Can Benchmark**: CPU and GPU performance primarily, but it provides insights into how different hardware setups (including those using RAID) handle workloads.
   - **Data of Interest**: While Geekbench is focused more on CPU/GPU, it’s still widely referenced in the tech community, and benchmarking your system's performance in conjunction with RAID could draw interest, especially from users focused on hardware comparisons.
   - **Website**: [Geekbench Browser](https://browser.geekbench.com/)

#### 6. **Phoronix Test Suite**
   - **Platform Overview**: The **Phoronix Test Suite** is a powerful benchmarking tool for Linux and is frequently used for publishing detailed benchmarking reports. It integrates directly with OpenBenchmarking.org for easy sharing.
   - **How It Works**: You can benchmark nearly any aspect of your system, including RAID1 performance, and then upload the results to OpenBenchmarking.org or generate reports to share elsewhere.
   - **What You Can Benchmark**: Anything, from CPU and GPU to disk I/O and custom workloads. It has dedicated tests for disk performance, making it ideal for your RAID1 + BTRFS setup.
   - **Data of Interest**: Phoronix is well-known in the Linux community, and users are likely interested in detailed RAID1 and BTRFS benchmarks, particularly with different hardware configurations.

### Why Your RAID1 + BTRFS Benchmarks Might Be of Interest
1. **Linux Enthusiasts and System Administrators**:
   - Many users working with **Linux-based RAID** (especially BTRFS RAID configurations) are constantly looking for real-world performance data. RAID1 with BTRFS is widely used in enterprise and personal systems, so benchmarks showcasing how well it performs on different hardware setups would be valuable.
   
2. **Storage Performance Comparisons**:
   - RAID1 is commonly used for redundancy, and people are often curious about how it impacts performance (especially read/write speeds). Your data can provide useful insights for users weighing redundancy versus performance trade-offs.
   
3. **Hardware Comparison**:
   - Performance benchmarks for RAID1 setups across different hardware (e.g., different SSDs, HDDs, or CPUs) could be of particular interest. People looking for RAID1 performance across varying configurations would find this data useful.
   
4. **BTRFS Performance Data**:
   - BTRFS, as a copy-on-write filesystem, handles RAID differently from other filesystems, and benchmarks showcasing how RAID1 performs with BTRFS compared to ext4 or XFS could be informative.

### Recommendations:
- **Use OpenBenchmarking.org with Phoronix Test Suite**: This is the best option for Linux benchmarking, and it's particularly strong in storage and filesystem performance tests. Your RAID1 and BTRFS benchmarks will be of high interest to the Linux community.
- **Consider UserBenchmark for Broader Audience**: While not Linux-specific, UserBenchmark offers a platform for sharing performance data that appeals to a broader audience of both casual and advanced users.
