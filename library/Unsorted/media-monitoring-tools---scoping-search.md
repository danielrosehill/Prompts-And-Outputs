# Prompt

Could you remind me of your previous recommendations? 

I manage communications on behalf of a thought leader in the impact investing space. I have a long list of Google Alerts for tracking various keywords across themes like sustainable investing, ESG, etc. But I find the alerts overwhelming and not that useful in actually identifying important news breakthroughs. 

Here's what I'm looking for:

A tool that both does the news aggregation but also does some intelligent pre-analysis to try to surface the news that really matters. In other words, an AI capability. I much prefer readig briefs in narrative format than links of links. So if synopses or reports could be generated in this manner, it would be ideal.

Can you think of any such tools? For every recommendation you produce, please also provide the cost per month.
