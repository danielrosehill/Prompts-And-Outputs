# Prompt

Web Catalog and Tangram look very relevant. These switcher tools are very interesting, but I'm looking for something a bit less restrictive. Can you suggest any that are like them?

# Output

Based on your interest in WebCatalog and Tangram, and your desire for something less restrictive, here are a few alternatives that might better suit your needs:

1. Ferdium:
Ferdium is an open-source, cross-platform alternative that's less restrictive than WebCatalog or Tangram[3]. It allows you to combine multiple web services into one application and offers:

- Workspaces feature for different arrangements of services
- No login required, addressing privacy concerns
- Ability to add custom services
- Option to separate work and personal uses

2. Wavebox:
While it's a commercial product, Wavebox offers more flexibility than Tangram[1]. It's Chromium-based and features:

- A full browser navigation bar
- A sidebar for launching specific web apps
- Ability to create desktop launchers for specific sites

3. Custom Electron App:
For maximum flexibility, you could create a custom Electron app. This would allow you to:

- Define your own grid layout
- Specify URLs to show in each part of the grid
- Customize the interface to your exact needs

4. Stack:
Although it's not yet released (planned for Q4 2022 as of the search results), Stack looks promising[1]. It organizes websites as stacked and grouped tiles, which might be close to the grid layout you're envisioning.

5. Rambox:
Rambox is another option that lets you pin multiple websites to a sidebar[1]. It has a clean GUI and might offer more flexibility than Tangram or WebCatalog.

These alternatives provide varying degrees of customization and flexibility. Ferdium or a custom Electron app might be your best options if you're looking for something highly customizable and less restrictive. Remember that you may need to do some configuration or light coding to achieve the exact grid layout you're envisioning with these tools.
