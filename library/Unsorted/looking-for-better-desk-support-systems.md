# Prompt

Can you recommend a good system for supporting the desk? The problem I have with the adjustable legs is that I can never get them to all be at the same height so the table ends up unbalanced. But I don't like that I can't adjust the height of the trestles. The motorised options would be my first choice but they're very expensive.

# Output

For your situation, where adjustable legs are difficult to balance but trestles lack flexibility, there are a few alternatives that offer a stable and adjustable solution without the premium cost of motorized frames. Here are some systems that strike a balance between adjustability, affordability, and stability:

### 1. **Fixed Height Desk Frames with Adjustable Feet**
- **Example**: FLEXISPOT E1 or IKEA TROTTEN frames
- **Price range**: $150 - $250
- **Details**: These frames provide manual adjustability in height (usually with fixed height options that you can set when assembling). They also come with **adjustable feet**, which help you level the desk on uneven surfaces, ensuring balance. This is a good middle ground if you don’t need frequent height adjustments but want to ensure the desk is level.

### 2. **Crank Height Adjustable Desk Frames**
- **Example**: Vivo Manual Height Adjustable Desk Frame or IKEA SKARSTA
- **Price range**: $250 - $350
- **Details**: These allow you to adjust the desk height manually with a hand crank. They are typically more affordable than motorized options but still offer flexibility to change height. The crank system is smooth and doesn't rely on electricity, which makes it a reliable option for long-term use. These frames also tend to have adjustable feet for balance.

### 3. **Height-Adjustable Desk Risers (Non-Frame Solution)**
- **Example**: VariDesk or FlexiSpot Desktop Converter
- **Price range**: $150 - $300
- **Details**: Instead of replacing the entire desk, you could use a **desk riser**, which sits on top of your existing desk and allows you to raise and lower just the workspace (your screens, keyboard, etc.). This is a cheaper option if you don’t mind keeping the desk height fixed but want ergonomic flexibility for standing.

### 4. **Crossbar Support with Adjustable Feet**
- **Price range**: $100 - $200
- **Details**: Another solution is using a **crossbar support system** with adjustable feet. This type of system includes a middle crossbar for additional stability across a wide desk and features adjustable feet to ensure all corners of the desk are level. You can use this with your existing trestles to ensure balance, but you would still need to manually adjust the height.

### 5. **DIY Solution: Adjustable Shims or Leg Levelers**
- **Price range**: Under $20
- **Details**: If you prefer keeping your existing trestles but want to solve the unbalanced issue, **adjustable furniture leg levelers** or **shims** might be a cost-effective solution. You attach these to the bottom of the legs to fine-tune the height of each leg until the desk is perfectly level. This would allow you to manually adjust for small height differences without needing to buy a new frame.

### Summary of Best Option for You:
If frequent height adjustment is important, a **crank-adjustable frame** like the IKEA SKARSTA could be your best choice for affordability and balance. If you only need to level the desk, a **fixed frame with adjustable feet** or a **crossbar support system** will provide extra stability and ensure all legs are level.
