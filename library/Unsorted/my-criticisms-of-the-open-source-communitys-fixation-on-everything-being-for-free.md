**Summary of your prompt:** You’ve noticed that some open-source communities on Reddit have unreasonable expectations around cost. You find Cloudron’s price of €30/month reasonable for a mature tool, especially given the savings from self-hosting versus SaaS, and are wondering if your conclusions are justified and whether others share similar sentiments. You also support open source but are against the "everything should be free" mentality, as you believe it’s unsustainable.

### Justification of Your Conclusions:
Your perspective is certainly justified. Here’s why:

1. **Cost vs. Value in Self-Hosting:**
   - Cloudron’s pricing of **€30/month** is indeed reasonable, especially when compared to the cost of commercial SaaS offerings. Many SaaS platforms with similar functionalities charge significantly more for enterprise or business solutions, often ranging from **€50 to €100+ per month**.
   - Self-hosting can significantly cut costs in the long term, especially for businesses. You control your infrastructure, data, and backups, avoiding vendor lock-in and per-user pricing models that scale up quickly with SaaS.

2. **The Reality of Development Costs:**
   - Developing, maintaining, and supporting software—especially something as feature-rich and stable as Cloudron—takes significant resources. The cost of €30/month helps sustain a dedicated team, provide continuous updates, handle security issues, and offer support, all while keeping the project alive.
   - Expecting open-source developers to provide **high-quality, well-maintained tools for free** can lead to burnout and the abandonment of projects.

3. **Open Source ≠ Free:**
   - Open source is about access to the source code and the freedom to modify and use it, not necessarily that everything should be free. Many successful open-source projects offer **freemium models** or paid tiers to support ongoing development. 
   - The misconception that open source should be entirely free often stems from the view that software doesn’t carry ongoing costs once built. However, in reality, support, feature updates, security patches, and improvements require continuous investment.

4. **Sustainability and the "Everything Should Be Free" Mentality:**
   - As you pointed out, the "everything should be free" mentality is **unsustainable**. Without revenue, developers and companies cannot sustain a business or project over the long term. Open-source projects without funding tend to rely on volunteer work, which can be unreliable and lead to slow updates or project abandonment.
   - Cloudron’s pricing model aligns with ensuring **long-term sustainability** for the project. It allows the developers to focus on maintaining a quality product while continuing to innovate, instead of relying purely on donations or goodwill.

### Others' Sentiments on This Topic:
Many in the open-source community share your sentiments, and this is often a topic of discussion. Here are some common points that align with your view:

1. **Recognition of Fair Pricing:**
   - Many users acknowledge that tools like Cloudron, which streamline deployment and management, **save time and effort**, justifying their costs. For businesses, €30/month is often seen as a **bargain** given the alternatives.
   - There's an increasing recognition that **supporting open-source projects financially** is necessary to maintain quality and innovation. Users understand that even though the code may be open, the time invested in its development deserves compensation.

2. **Pushback Against "Everything Free" Mentality:**
   - Some prominent voices in the open-source community have spoken out against the idea that everything should be free. This mentality tends to undervalue the developers’ time, skills, and the resources required to maintain the project.
   - A growing number of users advocate for paying for services or tools that are crucial to their workflows, as they realize that **paid support leads to better stability, faster updates, and improved features**.

3. **SaaS vs. Self-Hosting Costs:**
   - Many agree that **self-hosting** with platforms like Cloudron offers substantial savings in the long run. The control, flexibility, and reduced per-user fees make self-hosting a more **cost-effective** solution, especially for businesses or power users.
   - Users who run their own services often argue that spending on a good self-hosting tool is well worth it when compared to the recurring high costs of **SaaS platforms**.

### Final Thoughts:
Your conclusions are well-supported by many in the community who understand the balance between **value** and **cost**. While some parts of the open-source community may have unrealistic expectations, there’s a growing awareness that **sustainable open-source development requires financial support**. Tools like Cloudron, which offer significant value at a reasonable price, help maintain that balance by providing a business-grade service without the overhead costs of proprietary SaaS platforms.
