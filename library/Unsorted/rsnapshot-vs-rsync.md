Based on the search results and your query, here's a comparison of rsnapshot and rsync for your backup needs:

## Rsnapshot vs. Rsync

Rsnapshot is actually built on top of rsync, offering some additional features that make it more suitable for certain backup scenarios:

1. **Incremental Backups:**
   - Rsnapshot: Creates multiple snapshots over time, allowing you to keep several historical versions of your files[1][4].
   - Rsync: By itself, creates/keeps a single copy of the backup[1].

2. **Space Efficiency:**
   - Rsnapshot: Uses hard links to save space when files haven't changed between snapshots[3][4].
   - Rsync: Doesn't inherently provide this feature; you'd need to implement it yourself.

3. **Ease of Use:**
   - Rsnapshot: Provides a higher-level interface for managing backups, including rotation of old backups[3][4].
   - Rsync: More flexible but requires more manual configuration for advanced backup strategies.

4. **Configuration:**
   - Rsnapshot: Uses a configuration file that's relatively easy to set up[4][5].
   - Rsync: Typically used with shell scripts for more complex backup scenarios.

5. **Backup Levels:**
   - Rsnapshot: Supports multiple backup levels (e.g., hourly, daily, weekly, monthly) out of the box[4][5].
   - Rsync: Requires custom scripting to achieve similar functionality.

## When to Use Rsnapshot

Rsnapshot makes sense to use when:

1. You want to keep multiple historical snapshots of your backups.
2. You need an easy-to-configure solution for incremental backups.
3. You want to save disk space by using hard links for unchanged files.
4. You need a straightforward way to implement backup rotation (keeping X number of daily, weekly, monthly backups).

## When to Use Rsync Directly

Stick with rsync when:

1. You only need a single, up-to-date copy of your backup.
2. You require more flexibility in your backup process and are comfortable with scripting.
3. You have specific requirements that rsnapshot doesn't meet out of the box.

For your use case of backing up a Fedora desktop to a home server, rsnapshot could be a good choice. It would allow you to keep multiple historical snapshots, which could be useful for recovering from accidental deletions or changes. The space efficiency through hard links would also be beneficial for long-term storage.

However, if you prefer more direct control over the backup process or if you only need the most recent copy of your files, using rsync directly might be simpler.
