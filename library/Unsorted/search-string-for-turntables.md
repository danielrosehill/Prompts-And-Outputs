```

### Explanation:
- This search string uses the **OR** operator to combine the names of the four turntables, allowing you to find results that include any of these models.
- The quotes ensure that each model name is treated as a complete phrase, which improves the relevance of search results.

### Usage:
You can enter this search string into a search engine (like Google) or specific marketplaces (like Amazon or eBay) to find product listings, reviews, and pricing for these turntables. 

For further information about each model, you might want to check out specific retailers or review sites that specialize in audio equipment.
