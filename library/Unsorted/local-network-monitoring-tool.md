# Prompt

please recommend a tool I can self host and which can provide a list of all the clients on my LAN. I'd like to install this on the Ubuntu VM but (ideally) it would be able to report on devices across the network. My network has a mixture of wired devices, wireless devices (connected via a TP Link mesh network) and Zigbee devices (connected via an MQTT gateway). If possible, I'd like to get a list of local IPs, operating systems, etc. I'm not looking for a security tool as much as I'm looking for something to help me remember what device is at what IP.
I'd like something with a web UI that I can run on the Ubuntu server and access from any device.

# Output
**Prompt Summary:** You are looking for a self-hosted tool with a web UI that can provide a list of all clients on your LAN. You want to install it on an Ubuntu VM, and it should report on devices across your network, including wired devices, wireless devices connected via a TP-Link mesh network, and Zigbee devices connected via an MQTT gateway. The tool should show local IPs, operating systems, and other useful details to help you keep track of what device is at what IP.

Here are some recommended self-hosted tools that can fit your requirements:

### 1. **Nmap + Uptime Kuma**
   - **Description:** You can use **Nmap** to scan your network and then visualize the results with **Uptime Kuma**, a lightweight and modern web UI tool for monitoring and tracking network services. Although Nmap is primarily CLI-based, scheduling scans via Uptime Kuma can create a simple dashboard for device tracking.
   - **Features:**
     - **Web UI:** Use Uptime Kuma for easy access to scan results and ongoing monitoring.
     - **Device Details:** Nmap can show IPs, MAC addresses, open ports, and OS details.
     - **Scheduled Scans:** Automate periodic scans to keep an updated list of devices.
   - **Installation:** Install **Nmap** and **Uptime Kuma** on your Ubuntu server.
     ```bash
     # Install Nmap
     sudo apt install nmap

     # Run Uptime Kuma with Docker
     docker run -d -p 3001:3001 --name uptime-kuma louislam/uptime-kuma
     ```

### 2. **NetBox**
   - **Description:** NetBox is an infrastructure resource modeling (IRM) tool for documenting and managing IP addresses, devices, racks, and more. Although primarily designed for larger networks, it works very well for home setups to keep track of device details across the LAN.
   - **Features:**
     - **Web UI:** User-friendly interface to manage IP addresses and devices.
     - **Track IPs and Device Info:** Input OS, device roles, IP addresses, and other metadata.
     - **Flexible Data Model:** Custom fields allow you to record specific details relevant to your setup.
   - **Installation:** NetBox can be installed using Docker:
     ```bash
     git clone -b release https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox-docker.git
     cd netbox-docker
     docker-compose up -d
     ```
   - **Note:** Requires a bit of setup but offers extensive device management and tracking capabilities.

### 3. **Home Assistant Device Tracker**
   - **Description:** Since you already have Home Assistant, you can use its **Device Tracker** integrations to monitor devices across your LAN. By configuring Home Assistant to recognize devices through DHCP, Zigbee, MQTT, and Wi-Fi, it can provide detailed info about what devices are online, their IP addresses, and when they were last active.
   - **Features:**
     - **Web UI:** Home Assistant’s dashboard can show active devices with details on a single screen.
     - **Integration Friendly:** Seamlessly integrates with TP-Link, Zigbee2MQTT, and other network elements.
     - **Track Multiple Device Types:** Monitor Wi-Fi, Ethernet, and Zigbee devices.
   - **Configuration Example:**
     ```yaml
     device_tracker:
       - platform: nmap_tracker
         hosts: 192.168.1.0/24
         consider_home: 180
     ```
   - **Recommendation:** As you're already using Home Assistant, this could be the easiest to set up for basic tracking.

### 4. **Netdata**
   - **Description:** Netdata is a powerful, real-time monitoring tool that provides insights into devices, traffic, and services across the network. It doesn’t focus solely on listing devices but can be configured to display and monitor active clients, bandwidth, and performance.
   - **Features:**
     - **Web UI:** Intuitive interface with visual charts and real-time updates.
     - **Monitor Network Traffic:** Can provide insights into bandwidth usage and connected devices.
     - **Agent-Based Monitoring:** Can monitor other devices via agents for more detailed data.
   - **Installation:**
     ```bash
     bash <(curl -Ss https://my-netdata.io/kickstart.sh)
     ```

### 5. **Fingbox**
   - **Description:** Fingbox is a dedicated network device that provides comprehensive network discovery and management. Although it’s a paid hardware option, it offers a web UI that can be accessed remotely and is capable of tracking all devices across a mixed network setup.
   - **Features:**
     - **Web & Mobile UI:** Access the network overview from any device.
     - **Device Details:** Automatically recognizes devices, showing IPs, MAC addresses, OS, and more.
     - **Easy Setup:** Plug-and-play with in-depth network insights and automated monitoring.
   - **Recommendation:** Requires a purchase, but it’s a highly reliable solution if you're looking for something more plug-and-play.

### **Recommendation**
Given your criteria, I’d suggest trying **Home Assistant’s Device Tracker** if you want to keep things simple and integrated with your existing setup. For more detailed and structured network mapping, **NetBox** offers the most flexibility and customizability, though it requires a bit more setup.

If ease of use and a quick, reliable overview are most important, consider **Uptime Kuma** paired with **Nmap** for automated network scans, or **Netdata** for real-time monitoring with visual charts.
