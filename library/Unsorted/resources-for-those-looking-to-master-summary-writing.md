# Prompt

I've long been interested in how some organisations produce summaries of news events. I've highlighted the situational report (SITREP) format previously. I also find diplomatic cables very interesting. I'd love to explore how these very specific forms of writing could be instructive more broadly for those seeking to master the art of producing concise summaries from the ever growing pool of information currently at our disposal. Can you suggest some resources?

# Output

Your interest in **SITREPs** and **diplomatic cables** is fascinating, especially given how these forms embody the art of **concise information synthesis**. Here are some resources and approaches you could explore to understand these writing styles better and learn how to apply their principles to broader information summarization:

### **1. Manuals and Guides on SITREPs and Diplomatic Writing**
- **Military Manuals**:
  - Manuals from the **U.S. Department of Defense** or **NATO** often provide specific guidance on **SITREP** formats. While some documents are classified, there are **publicly available military field manuals** that cover **report writing** in a military context. The focus is on clarity, brevity, and delivering essential facts, which are key elements of effective summarization.
  - Look into publications like the **“FM 6-99 U.S. Army Report and Message Formats”**, which outlines structured formats for different types of reports, including situational updates.

- **Diplomatic Training Materials**:
  - The **Foreign Service Institute (FSI)** and similar institutions often use manuals that teach diplomats how to write **cables**. Cables are designed to convey essential information to decision-makers succinctly. You might find summaries or excerpts of such guidelines online or in books about diplomacy.
  - Books like **“Cable: The Making of a Modern Ambassador” by William L. Adams** provide insights into the writing process behind diplomatic communications, focusing on both substance and brevity.

### **2. Books and Resources on Concise Writing and Analysis**
- **“The Pyramid Principle” by Barbara Minto**:
  - This book is often used in consulting and business circles to train people on how to convey **information in a structured and concise way**. It uses a top-down approach, focusing on **getting to the point first**—a technique highly similar to how SITREPs are structured.

- **“How to Write Short: Word Craft for Fast Times” by Roy Peter Clark**:
  - This book offers practical advice for writing concise, effective summaries in today's information-overload world. It teaches how to distill information to its essentials, much like diplomatic cables and SITREPs.

- **“The Elements of Style” by Strunk and White**:
  - This classic book offers essential guidance on **conciseness** and **clarity** in writing. It emphasizes stripping out unnecessary words, a principle that is crucial for writing effective SITREPs or diplomatic cables.

### **3. Online Courses and Workshops**
- **Coursera / edX**:
  - Courses like **“Writing for Strategic Communication”** or **“Journalistic Writing for Clarity and Conciseness”** often emphasize the skills needed to communicate complex information clearly and succinctly, similar to the objectives of SITREPs and diplomatic cables.
  - **“Writing in the Sciences” by Stanford University** on Coursera focuses on creating clear, precise summaries, especially useful if you want to adopt a factual and analytical style.

- **Government Websites and Wikis**:
  - The **U.S. Government Publishing Office** and other governmental organizations sometimes provide access to free courses and guides on **briefing note writing** and **executive summary drafting**, which can be quite similar in structure and intent to diplomatic cables.

### **4. Specific Examples of Concise Reports**
- **Wikileaks Cables**:
  - Many diplomatic cables have been published on platforms like **Wikileaks**. While the context of their release can be controversial, they serve as practical examples of the format, tone, and conciseness typical of such communications. Studying these documents can provide direct insight into what makes these reports effective.
  
- **Declassified Military Reports**:
  - Occasionally, **declassified military documents** are available online that offer examples of SITREPs and other similar brief formats. These are useful for seeing firsthand how to summarize large amounts of information into an actionable and concise format.

### **5. Techniques for Conciseness**
- **Bullet Points and Structured Summaries**:
  - Both SITREPs and diplomatic cables often use **bullet points** and strict formatting rules to maintain clarity and focus. Learning how to effectively use **sub-headings** and **bullet points** helps in segmenting information logically, making it easier for readers to grasp the main points quickly.

- **Practice Writing Briefs**:
  - Consider practicing with tools like **“News in Levels”**, which takes news articles and breaks them down into different levels of complexity, or **Executive Summary Generators** available online. Tools like these help practice **condensing information** while retaining key insights.

### **6. Analysis of Existing News Summary Platforms**
- Platforms like **BBC News** or **Reuters** often have a **summary** or **“Key Points”** section for major articles. Analyzing how these sections are written can give you a model to follow, as these summaries are designed to quickly convey the essence of the news event in a very SITREP-like manner.
  
- **The Economist’s Briefing**: Reading “The Economist's” news briefings or “Daily Intelligence Brief” newsletters can offer insights into how professional journalists create impactful, brief summaries.

### **7. Tools for Practicing Summary Writing**
- **Summarization Tools**:
  - Try using tools like **ChatGPT**, **SummarizeBot**, or **Resoomer** to generate initial summaries of news articles or reports. Afterward, revise and edit those summaries to improve their focus and clarity, which is a good way to learn by iteration.
  
- **Create Your Own SITREPs**:
  - Practice summarizing major news events into a **SITREP format**: include sections like the **Situation Overview**, **Key Facts**, **Analysis**, and **Next Steps**. This structure will help you learn to prioritize information and present it in an organized and concise manner.

### **8. Other Relevant Books and Materials**
- **“The Art of Condensed Writing”**:
  - Books on **journalism** or **executive communication** often teach how to condense long stories into summaries that only include the most relevant information. Journalists writing wire reports, for instance, must condense long press releases into a few short paragraphs, much like a SITREP or cable.

### **Summary of Approach**
- Explore **military manuals** and **diplomatic guides** to understand the formal requirements of SITREPs and cables.
- Study declassified documents or publicly available diplomatic cables for practical examples.
- Leverage **courses** and **books** that focus on **concise writing** techniques.
- Practice summarizing news and information yourself, following strict guidelines akin to those used in SITREPs.

These resources will provide a structured approach to mastering the art of summarizing information in a concise yet informative manner, drawing inspiration from fields where **precision** and **brevity** are paramount. Let me know if any of these specific suggestions interest you, and I can help guide you further down that path!

# Prompt

Declassified SITREPs would certainly be good. The problem with Wikileaks is that it's a huge pile of information. For the former, could you share any resources? For the latter, has anybody thought to write a summary?

# Outputs

Accessing **declassified SITREPs** can indeed be a powerful way to understand the concise reporting structure that these documents employ.
