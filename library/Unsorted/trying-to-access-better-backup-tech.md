# Prompt

If I were to find a company that only typically sold backup solutions to large enterprises ... do I have any chance of convincing them to do business with me as a single user at a price point I can afford? Is it worth a try askign?

# Output

Based on your query about approaching enterprise-focused backup companies as a single user, here's my assessment:

1. Chances of success:
Generally, the chances of convincing an enterprise-focused backup company to offer their services to a single user at an affordable price point are quite low. These companies typically have:

- Minimum user or data volume requirements
- Pricing structures designed for large-scale deployments
- Support and infrastructure geared towards enterprise needs

2. Potential challenges:
- Cost: Enterprise solutions are often priced well beyond individual user budgets
- Feature overkill: You may end up paying for features you don't need
- Minimum commitments: There might be minimum contract lengths or data volumes

3. Possible exceptions:
Some enterprise-focused companies might:
- Offer scaled-down versions for smaller businesses or individuals
- Be interested in expanding their market to include power users or small businesses
- Have special programs for testing or feedback from individual users

4. Is it worth trying?
While the chances are slim, there's no harm in asking. You might:
- Learn about alternative solutions they offer for smaller scale users
- Get insights into upcoming products that might suit your needs
- Potentially negotiate a special arrangement if your use case is interesting to them

5. Approach:
If you decide to reach out:
- Clearly explain your specific needs and use case
- Ask if they have any solutions or programs for individual power users
- Inquire about potential future offerings for smaller scale deployments

6. Alternatives:
Consider looking into:
- Prosumer versions of enterprise backup solutions
- Business-focused backup services that cater to small businesses
- Advanced consumer backup solutions that might meet your needs

In conclusion, while it's unlikely to get an enterprise-level solution at an individual user price point, there's no harm in inquiring. The conversation might lead to unexpected opportunities or alternative solutions you hadn't considered.
