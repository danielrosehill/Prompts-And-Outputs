You asked about schools of philosophy that championed a worldview focused on research, knowledge acquisition, and understanding, as well as those that opposed it. Here’s a breakdown of key philosophical movements that align with or oppose this worldview:

Schools that Championed the Value of Research and Knowledge:

1. Rationalism:

Key Philosophers: René Descartes, Baruch Spinoza, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz

Core Beliefs: Rationalists believe that reason and logic are the primary sources of knowledge, emphasizing deductive reasoning to understand fundamental truths about the world. They champion the idea that some knowledge is innate and that intellectual discovery is essential for understanding the nature of reality.



2. Empiricism:

Key Philosophers: John Locke, George Berkeley, David Hume

Core Beliefs: Empiricism argues that knowledge is derived from sensory experience. Empiricists place immense value on observation, experimentation, and evidence as the path to understanding the world. They laid the foundation for modern scientific methods.



3. The Enlightenment:

Key Philosophers: Immanuel Kant, Voltaire, Denis Diderot

Core Beliefs: The Enlightenment was a movement that emphasized reason, science, and the pursuit of knowledge as the highest human endeavors. Thinkers in this tradition believed that through research and rational inquiry, society could improve, and human understanding could flourish.



4. Logical Positivism:

Key Philosophers: Ludwig Wittgenstein, A.J. Ayer, Rudolf Carnap

Core Beliefs: This school of thought asserts that knowledge must be based on verifiable, empirical facts. Logical positivists emphasized the importance of scientific knowledge and logical analysis, dismissing metaphysical claims as meaningless if they cannot be empirically tested.



5. Pragmatism:

Key Philosophers: Charles Sanders Peirce, William James, John Dewey

Core Beliefs: Pragmatists believe that the value of knowledge lies in its practical application. For pragmatists, research and inquiry are vital for understanding how ideas work in practice, and knowledge should be judged by its consequences and usefulness in solving problems.



6. Critical Rationalism:

Key Philosophers: Karl Popper

Core Beliefs: Popper's philosophy of science emphasizes the importance of falsifiability in scientific inquiry. He argued that scientific theories should be rigorously tested and subjected to potential refutation, placing high value on the continuous pursuit of knowledge through research.




Schools that Opposed this Worldview:

1. Skepticism:

Key Philosophers: Pyrrho, Sextus Empiricus

Core Beliefs: Skepticism questions whether any knowledge can truly be known. Radical skeptics doubt the possibility of achieving certainty in knowledge, casting doubt on the value of research or inquiry as a means to fully understand the world. While not outright opposed to inquiry, they argue that certainty may be unattainable.



2. Romanticism:

Key Philosophers: Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Johann Gottfried Herder

Core Beliefs: Romanticism reacted against the Enlightenment's emphasis on reason and scientific inquiry, instead valuing emotion, intuition, and individual experience as ways of understanding the world. Romantics often criticized the reduction of human experience to rational analysis, favoring subjective and emotional knowledge.



3. Existentialism:

Key Philosophers: Søren Kierkegaard, Friedrich Nietzsche, Jean-Paul Sartre

Core Beliefs: While not entirely opposed to knowledge, existentialism focuses more on individual experience, freedom, and the subjective meaning of existence rather than objective, universal truths. Existentialists often critiqued overly rationalistic approaches to life, emphasizing the limitations of reason in understanding human existence and the absurdity of trying to rationalize life’s inherent meaninglessness.



4. Postmodernism:

Key Philosophers: Michel Foucault, Jean-François Lyotard, Jacques Derrida

Core Beliefs: Postmodernists critique the idea of objective knowledge and grand narratives that claim to explain reality. They are skeptical of the idea that research and inquiry lead to universal truths, arguing that knowledge is socially constructed, often used to exercise power, and varies across contexts.
5. Idealism:

Key Philosophers: Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Friedrich Schelling

Core Beliefs: Idealists argue that reality is shaped by the mind rather than external, empirical facts. While they value knowledge, they oppose the empiricist and materialist view that knowledge comes solely from observation of the physical world, suggesting instead that understanding comes from intellectual or spiritual insight

Summary

The championing schools, like rationalism, empiricism, and logical positivism, emphasize research, reason, and the empirical pursuit of knowledge. In contrast, the opposing schools, such as skepticism, romanticism, and postmodernism, question or reject the idea that objective knowledge or rational inquiry can fully capture the complexities of human experience and reality.
