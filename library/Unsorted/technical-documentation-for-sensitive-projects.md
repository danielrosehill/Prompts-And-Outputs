Yes, technical documentation is indeed used in the intelligence and defense sectors to document sensitive processes, hardware, and software systems. Due to the sensitive nature of this information, these documents often require enhanced security measures, including encryption and controlled access. Here are a few aspects and platforms related to this:

### Security Measures for Technical Documentation:
1. **Encryption**:
   - **At Rest and In Transit**: Sensitive documents are often encrypted both when stored (at rest) and while being transmitted over networks. Tools may use encryption standards like AES-256.
   - **Password Protection**: Additional layers of encryption through password protection can also be employed.

2. **Access Control and Auditing**:
   - **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Only authorized personnel can view, edit, or share documents. Platforms often implement detailed permission systems.
   - **Activity Logs**: Tracking who accessed or modified a document, and when, is critical for maintaining security.

### Platforms Favored for Secure Documentation:
1. **Confluence (Self-Hosted) with Encryption Add-ons**:
   - Can be set up on secure internal servers with encryption add-ons to enhance security.
   - Supports detailed permissions and logging.

2. **Nextcloud with File Encryption**:
   - Self-hostable file management system that supports end-to-end encryption. Technical documents can be managed securely, with features for access control.

3. **Git-Based Repositories with Encryption**:
   - Platforms like **GitLab** and **Gitea** allow hosting private repositories. Integrate with encryption tools (e.g., **GPG**) to encrypt specific files within a repository.

4. **Documize**:
   - An enterprise wiki that can be self-hosted, supporting granular access controls and integration with encryption.

These tools and practices ensure that sensitive technical documentation can be managed securely, maintaining confidentiality and integrity while allowing authorized personnel to collaborate efficiently.
