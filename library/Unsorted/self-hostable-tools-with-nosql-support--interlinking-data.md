Prompt: Please suggest self-hostable tools for storing text entities like documents or notes which can be self-hosted and which support a NoSQL database. I would like to store text files (GPT outputs) and define custom taxonomies and store this metadata with the notes. In this way, I would like to create a very interlinked knowledge repository. Please suggest tools that could help me implement this

Here are some self-hostable tools that support storing text entities (like documents or notes) in a NoSQL database and allow you to define custom taxonomies and metadata for creating an interlinked knowledge repository:

### 1. **Trilium Notes**
   - **Database**: MongoDB (NoSQL)
   - **Features**:
     - **Custom Metadata**: Trilium allows you to add custom attributes and metadata to notes, which can be used for classification and interlinking.
     - **Interlinking**: Supports bi-directional linking between notes, enabling you to create a highly interconnected knowledge base.
     - **Hierarchical Organization**: Notes can be organized in a tree structure, with each note able to link to others, forming a web of connections.
   - **Backup**: Data can be backed up by exporting notes or backing up the underlying MongoDB database.

### 2. **Wiki.js**
   - **Database**: Supports various databases, including MongoDB (NoSQL) and PostgreSQL.
   - **Features**:
     - **Custom Metadata**: Wiki.js supports custom fields and metadata for each document, allowing you to define taxonomies and tags.
     - **Interlinking**: Documents can be interlinked through internal links and tags, creating a web of knowledge.
     - **Markdown Support**: Documents are stored in Markdown, which is easy to export and backup.
   - **Backup**: Data can be exported to Markdown files or backed up directly from the database.

### 3. **TiddlyWiki with TiddlyServer or TiddlyWeb**
   - **Database**: JSON-like data structures or can be extended to use NoSQL databases with TiddlyServer or TiddlyWeb.
   - **Features**:
     - **Custom Metadata**: TiddlyWiki allows extensive customization of fields and metadata for each "tiddler" (note).
     - **Interlinking**: Natively supports creating a highly interlinked structure between notes.
     - **Single-File or Multi-User Mode**: Can be used as a single HTML file or hosted for multi-user access.
   - **Backup**: Easy to back up as a single HTML file or through regular backups of the hosted data.

### 4. **Dendron (VSCode Extension)**
   - **Database**: Works on a local file system with NoSQL-like data structure capabilities when integrated with tools like CouchDB.
   - **Features**:
     - **Hierarchical Tagging**: Supports hierarchical tagging and custom metadata for each note.
     - **Interlinking**: Notes can be interlinked with backlinks and references, creating a rich knowledge graph.
     - **Markdown-Based**: Notes are stored in Markdown, allowing for easy backup and version control.
   - **Backup**: Can be backed up using Git or other version control systems.

### 5. **Logseq**
   - **Database**: Logseq uses a local graph database, which can be stored in a NoSQL-compatible format.
   - **Features**:
     - **Custom Metadata**: Supports custom properties and tags, enabling advanced classification of notes.
     - **Interlinking**: Bi-directional linking is a core feature, making it ideal for creating an interconnected knowledge repository.
     - **Local-First**: Logseq stores data locally, with the option to sync using Git.
   - **Backup**: Data can be backed up using Git, ensuring all links and metadata are preserved.

### 6. **Turtl**
   - **Database**: Uses a NoSQL-like storage system (CouchDB).
   - **Features**:
     - **Tagging and Metadata**: Allows for tagging and custom metadata, which can be used to categorize and link notes.
     - **Encryption**: All notes are encrypted, providing an extra layer of security.
     - **Interlinking**: Notes can be interlinked based on tags and content references.
   - **Backup**: You can back up Turtl’s data by exporting it or directly backing up the CouchDB database.

### 7. **Meilisearch (with a Frontend like Writings.io)**
   - **Database**: Meilisearch is a NoSQL search engine that can store and retrieve documents based on indexed metadata.
   - **Features**:
     - **Custom Metadata**: Supports custom fields and metadata, which can be used to tag and organize notes.
     - **Interlinking**: Notes can be linked through metadata and content references, making it possible to create an interlinked repository.
     - **Search-First**: Optimized for fast searching across large volumes of text data.
   - **Backup**: Data can be exported and backed up using Meilisearch’s built-in tools or by backing up the underlying data storage.

These tools offer a variety of options for creating a self-hosted, interlinked knowledge repository with NoSQL database support. They provide flexibility in defining custom taxonomies, managing metadata, and creating connections between notes, making them ideal for organizing and retrieving large volumes of text data.
