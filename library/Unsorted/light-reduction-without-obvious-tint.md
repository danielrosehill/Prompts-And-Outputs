You asked if there are tinted glasses that can substantially reduce brightness but without being conspicuously tinted. There are several options that offer subtle tints while still reducing glare and brightness effectively:

1. Photochromic Lenses (Transitions Lenses): These lenses adjust their tint based on the level of UV exposure. Indoors, they appear almost clear, and they darken outdoors in bright light. This way, they can reduce brightness when needed, without having a strong tint indoors. The transition is gradual, so they won’t be too obvious in regular indoor lighting.


2. Gradient Tinted Lenses: These lenses are darker at the top and gradually become lighter toward the bottom. The tint is subtle and stylish, but they still reduce brightness effectively. This is especially useful if you're looking for something fashionable yet functional, as the lighter portion keeps your vision clearer for reading or close-up tasks.


3. Neutral Gray or Light Gray Lenses: Gray lenses are often used for brightness reduction because they darken evenly without distorting colors. A lighter gray tint can reduce brightness significantly while being less noticeable compared to dark tints or colors like amber or brown.


4. Polarized Lenses with Minimal Tint: Polarized lenses are designed to reduce glare, particularly from reflective surfaces like water, roads, or screens. Some polarized lenses come with a very light tint that isn’t obvious but can still effectively cut down on glare and brightness. These are great if you want to reduce brightness while maintaining a subtle appearance.


5. Blue Light Glasses with a Mild Tint: Some blue light blocking glasses come with a very light amber or yellow tint that isn’t strongly visible but can still reduce the brightness from screens and artificial lighting. These tints are usually mild enough not to draw attention but still offer some relief from brightness and eye strain.



Conclusion:

While these options won’t be as dramatically effective as very dark sunglasses, they can still help reduce brightness in a subtle way. Photochromic and polarized lenses are especially good choices if you want to reduce brightness without a conspicuous tint.
