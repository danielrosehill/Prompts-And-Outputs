# Prompt

can you recommend a backup schedule for an important business asset like my fedora workstation? 

# Output

For a system as important as your Fedora workstation, it's crucial to have a well-planned backup schedule that ensures minimal data loss and quick recovery in case of any issues. Here's a recommended backup schedule that balances data safety with efficiency:

### 1. **Daily Incremental Backups** (Data changes)
- **What to back up**: Only files that have changed since the last backup (this could be configuration files, documents, project data, and user-specific folders like `/home`, databases if you have them running).
- **Frequency**: Every day, preferably during off-hours or when the system is idle.
- **Retention**: Keep daily backups for the last 7 days.
- **Method**: Use `rsync`, `BorgBackup`, or `Duplicity` to create incremental backups. Store these backups on a secondary drive (such as your SSD) or a remote server/cloud.

### 2. **Weekly Full Backups** (Entire system)
- **What to back up**: Complete system backup, including system files, configurations, and all data. This ensures that even if the system needs to be fully restored, it can be done from these weekly backups.
- **Frequency**: Once a week, scheduled for a weekend or a time when the system is least used.
- **Retention**: Keep weekly backups for the last 4 weeks.
- **Method**: A tool like `rsync`, `Bacula`, or `Timeshift` (if you are using snapshots for the system), or `Deja Dup` for a simpler solution.

### 3. **Monthly Full Backups** (Long-term storage)
- **What to back up**: Full system and important project/data files. This is your long-term archive.
- **Frequency**: Once a month.
- **Retention**: Keep the last 6 months of monthly backups.
- **Method**: Full system image backup using tools like `Clonezilla`, or another comprehensive tool such as `Restic`.

### 4. **Cloud/Offsite Backups**
- **What to back up**: Critical data such as financial records, important project files, databases, and configuration files.
- **Frequency**: Weekly (or more frequently depending on criticality).
- **Retention**: At least 3 months.
- **Method**: Sync to a cloud service like Backblaze B2, AWS S3, or Google Drive using tools like `rclone`. Encrypt backups before uploading using GPG or another encryption tool.

### 5. **Snapshot/Versioning** (for instant recovery)
- **What to back up**: Create regular snapshots of the system using a snapshot tool like `btrfs` (since you're already using BTRFS). These snapshots can quickly roll back your system to a previous state.
- **Frequency**: Every few hours or daily.
- **Retention**: Last 7 days.
- **Method**: Set up automatic snapshotting using tools like `snapper`.

### Example Schedule

| Backup Type      | Frequency   | Retention      | Tool                               |
|------------------|-------------|----------------|------------------------------------|
| Incremental      | Daily       | Last 7 days    | `rsync`, `BorgBackup`, `Duplicity` |
| Full             | Weekly      | Last 4 weeks   | `rsync`, `Bacula`, `Timeshift`     |
| Full (long-term) | Monthly     | Last 6 months  | `Clonezilla`, `Restic`             |
| Cloud Backup     | Weekly      | Last 3 months  | `rclone` + encrypted backup        |
| Snapshots        | Hourly/Daily| Last 7 days    | `snapper` (BTRFS snapshots)        |

### Additional Considerations:
- **Automation**: Use `cron` jobs to automate these backups, ensuring that you donâ€™t need to remember to initiate backups manually.
- **Encryption**: Always encrypt sensitive data before backing it up, especially for offsite/cloud storage.
- **Test Your Backups**: Regularly test your backups to ensure that you can restore your data without any issues.

This schedule will provide a strong balance between redundancy, data safety, and storage efficiency, making sure your Fedora workstation's important business assets are well-protected.
