# Prompt

are there no linux apps or web apps built explicitly for the purpose of showing many live video feeds in a grid layout? But to be clear ... I'm showing live web TV channels in a grid and not the feeds directly

# Output

Yes, there are **apps and services** designed for displaying multiple live streams in a **grid layout**, though most are traditionally used for **surveillance**, **multimedia** setups, or **multi-stream viewing**. However, when it comes to web TV channels and live streaming via web-based sources, the options are more limited, but there are still some tools that can help achieve what you're looking for.

Here are some **Linux apps**, **web apps**, and **browser extensions** that can help you view **live web TV streams** in a **grid layout**:

### 1. **Streamlink + Tiling Window Manager (e.g., i3, bspwm)**
   - **Description**: **Streamlink** is a command-line tool that extracts video streams from various services (such as YouTube, Twitch, etc.) and sends them to a media player like **VLC**. When used in combination with a **tiling window manager** (like **i3** or **bspwm**), you can easily display multiple live streams in a grid.
   - **How to Use**:
     1. Install **Streamlink** and **VLC**:
        ```bash
        sudo dnf install streamlink vlc
        ```
     2. Launch multiple streams using Streamlink:
        ```bash
        streamlink https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCNeDWCI0vo best
        ```
     3. Use a **tiling window manager** like i3 to automatically arrange VLC windows in a grid.

   - **Why use it**: Streamlink allows you to watch streams from various services without ads or interruptions, and a tiling window manager can help organize the streams into a grid.

### 2. **Multiviewers:**
   There are a few tools designed explicitly to display multiple streams in a grid, though they are often used for specific purposes like Twitch or YouTube. However, these can be adapted for any web-based TV channel with the right stream links.

#### a) **MultiTwitch**
   - **Description**: **MultiTwitch** is a web app built for displaying multiple Twitch streams simultaneously in a grid layout.
   - **How to Use**: Although it's designed for Twitch, you can adapt it for any service that provides a live stream URL (Twitch or otherwise). You can experiment by creating custom embeds.
   - **Website**: [MultiTwitch](https://multitwitch.tv)
   - **Why use it**: Simple, browser-based, and no installation is required. It can handle multiple streams easily in a grid.

#### b) **YouTube Multistream**
   - **Description**: This is a web app designed to let you watch multiple YouTube live streams at the same time in a grid.
   - **How to Use**: You can input multiple YouTube URLs and display them simultaneously. Some modifications may be needed to use other services with embed URLs.
   - **Website**: [YouTube Multistream](https://youtube-multistream.vercel.app/)

     2. Select the tabs by holding **Ctrl** (or **Cmd** on macOS), right-click, and choose **Tile Tabs** > **Grid Layout**.
   - **Why use it**: No need for external tools—everything happens within your browser, and it's highly customizable.
   - **Perfect for**: People who want an integrated browser solution without additional software.

### 4. **Split-Screen Browser Extensions (for Chrome/Firefox)**
   - **Description**: Several browser extensions are available to split the screen into a grid and display multiple websites simultaneously.
   - **Recommended Extensions**:
     - **Tab Resize – Split Screen Layouts**: Allows you to quickly resize and arrange tabs in a grid.

       - [Tile Tabs WE (Firefox)](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tile-tabs-we/)
   - **How to Use**: Open your live streams in separate tabs and use the extension to tile them into a 2x2 or larger grid.

### 5. **OBS Studio (Custom Web Feeds as Sources)**
   - **Description**: **OBS Studio** is an open-source video streaming and recording software that allows you to combine multiple sources (including web streams) into a single view.

### Conclusion:
While there aren’t many tools **explicitly for watching live web TV streams** in a grid layout, there are several **browser-based solutions** like **Vivaldi’s Tab Tiling** and **browser extensions** (Tab Resize, Tile Tabs WE) that can achieve this.

For more complex setups, you can consider tools like **OBS Studio** or **Streamlink** combined with a **tiling window manager**. These methods allow greater flexibility, especially if you want to watch streams from multiple sources like YouTube, Twitch, or independent live TV channels.

Let me know if you’d like more detailed help setting any of these up!
