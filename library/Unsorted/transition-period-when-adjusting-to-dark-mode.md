Yes, there’s often a short transition period when switching to dark mode, especially if you’ve used light themes for a long time. Here’s what you might experience:

1. **Initial Eye Adjustment**: Moving from a bright to a dark background can make your eyes take a bit of time to adapt, similar to entering a dimly lit room after being outside. You might notice minor strain or even a “floaty” effect for a day or two.

2. **Cognitive Adjustment**: Dark mode may initially feel unfamiliar, and recognizing UI elements or reading text can sometimes feel slightly different. As you adjust, your brain learns to interpret the new color contrasts more naturally.

3. **Reduced Blue Light**: Dark mode typically reduces blue light exposure, which may lead to a subtle, calming effect over time, particularly in the evening hours. 

Usually, after a few days, most users report feeling more comfortable, and they often prefer the calmer experience for extended screen time. If you’re starting to feel more comfortable, that’s a good sign your eyes are adjusting well!
