Here's a structured outline to articulate what you consider as the **basic acceptable level of backup support** for SaaS applications:

### **1. Introduction: Importance of Robust Backup Support**
   - **Data Security and Ownership**: Emphasize the significance of ensuring that users retain control over their data, especially when using SaaS solutions.
   - **User Trust and Compliance**: Highlight that robust backup capabilities not only foster user trust but also address critical aspects of compliance and security.

### **2. Key Requirements for Acceptable Backup Support**
   - **Automatic Backups**:
     - Users should not be solely responsible for initiating backups. Instead, data should be backed up regularly and automatically without requiring user intervention.
     - Backups should occur frequently to minimize data loss risks and maintain a continuous, updated record.
   - **Programmatic Backups**:
     - Provide an API or some form of programmatic access that allows users to automate backup processes.
     - This enables integration with other backup systems and facilitates customized backup workflows.
   - **Incremental Backups**:
     - Only new or modified data should be backed up incrementally after the initial full backup.
     - This reduces redundancy and allows for efficient use of storage and resources.

### **3. Data Backup Format Requirements**
   - **Comprehensive Data Capture**:
     - Backups must include **all data committed to the service**, meaning every piece of user-generated content, metadata, attachments, or related information.
     - For instance, if using a hosted blog, the backup must include **text, images, embedded files**, etc., so the user has a complete and usable archive.
   - **User-Friendly, Open Formats**:
     - Backups should be delivered in standard, open formats such as **Markdown, CSV, or full archive formats** that users can easily access, understand, and import into other systems.
     - Ensure the format is not proprietary and **captures the full extent of the data imprint**, including metadata, relationships, and attached media.

### **4. Unacceptable Backup Approaches**
   - **GDPR or Legal Requests for Data Backup**:
     - Backups shouldn't depend on privacy law requests, such as GDPR data access requests. Users should be able to back up data **without filing formal requests**.
   - **Manual Backup Initiation**:
     - Requiring users to manually trigger backups is insufficient and unreliable.
     - Backups must be **automated** to prevent data loss from forgotten or skipped manual actions.
   - **Insufficient Backup Delivery Methods**:
     - Delivering backups through the **user's inbox** or via formats like **basic JSON** files often fails to capture the full data structure.
     - Backup must be delivered in a **comprehensive format** that is complete and usable.
   - **Uncontrolled Backup Storage**:
     - Backups should not be limited to storage environments that the user cannot access or control.
     - Data should be stored in a manner **separate from the primary platform** (e.g., the user's own cloud storage, external drives) to ensure independence and control.

### **5. Examples of Good Backup Practices in SaaS**
   - **Export API**: Providing an export API that enables seamless integration with external backup tools or cloud storage.
   - **Scheduled Backups to User-Designated Storage**: Enabling users to schedule regular backups to their preferred location (e.g., personal cloud account, self-hosted server).
   - **Full Data Download Options**: Allowing users to download an entire archive of their data on demand, but also having automatic, programmatic, and incremental mechanisms in place.

### **6. Conclusion: The Standard for User Empowerment**
   - The outlined practices should serve as the **minimum standard** for backup support in SaaS applications.
   - By providing automatic, programmatic, and incremental backup options in accessible formats, SaaS companies can empower users, safeguard data, and build greater trust in their platform.
