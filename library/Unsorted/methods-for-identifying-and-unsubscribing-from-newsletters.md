To **automatically find and unsubscribe** from newsletters in your **Google Workspace** inbox, you have several options—some are built into Gmail, while others involve third-party tools that automate the process effectively. Here are some methods to consider:

### 1. **Gmail's Built-In Unsubscribe Feature**
   - **How It Works**: Gmail has a built-in **unsubscribe** feature for newsletters and promotional emails. If Gmail identifies the email as a newsletter, an "Unsubscribe" link often appears next to the sender's email address at the top of the message.
   - **How to Use**:
     - Search for emails with “Unsubscribe” in the content by using Gmail search operators: 
       ```
       label:inbox "unsubscribe"
       ```
     - Gmail will show you all emails with an unsubscribe link, making it easy to manually go through and remove yourself from unwanted lists.

### 2. **Third-Party Tools**
#### a. **Clean Email**
   - **Overview**: **Clean Email** is a third-party service that helps you manage email subscriptions, among other inbox cleaning functions. It has a feature called **"Unsubscriber"** that finds all newsletters and promotional subscriptions and allows you to unsubscribe from them in bulk.
   - **How It Works**:
     - Connect your **Google Workspace** account to Clean Email.
     - The **Unsubscriber** feature lists all detected subscriptions, and you can choose to unsubscribe from unwanted ones either individually or in bulk.
   - **Automation**: Clean Email can also automate the process by creating rules to **block future subscriptions** automatically.
   - **Pricing**: Clean Email offers a free trial, and its paid version starts at about **$9.99 per month**.

#### b. **Leave Me Alone**
   - **Overview**: **Leave Me Alone** is a service specifically designed to help you unsubscribe from unwanted emails. It scans your inbox and provides a list of all the subscriptions it finds.
   - **How It Works**:
     - Connect your **Google Workspace** inbox.
     - **Leave Me Alone** shows a list of all detected subscriptions, which you can easily unsubscribe from within the app.
   - **Privacy**: It emphasizes **privacy** and claims that it doesn’t store email content.
   - **Pricing**: **Pay-as-you-go** pricing, starting at **$10 for 50 unsubscribes**, and scales based on your needs.

#### c. **Unroll.Me**
   - **Overview**: **Unroll.Me** is another free service that helps unsubscribe from email lists in bulk. It finds newsletters and categorizes them, allowing you to easily unsubscribe from multiple sources at once.
   - **How It Works**:
     - Connect your **Google Workspace** account.
     - It provides an overview of all your subscriptions and allows you to **unsubscribe, keep, or roll up** the emails into a daily digest.
   - **Note**: **Unroll.Me** has faced privacy concerns in the past, as they previously used customer data for analytics. Ensure you are comfortable with their privacy practices before using.

### 3. **Zapier Automation**
   - **Overview**: You can use **Zapier** to create automation that detects newsletters and manages them effectively.
   - **How It Works**:
     - Set up a Zap that uses filters to find emails with specific characteristics, like having "Unsubscribe" in the body or subject line.
     - The Zap can tag or move these emails to a specific folder where you can review them later.
     - While Zapier won't unsubscribe automatically, it makes it easier to collect all subscription emails in one place for faster management.
   - **Ideal For**: If you have other automation needs and prefer customizable workflows.

### 4. **Gmail Filters**
   - **How It Works**:
     - You can create **Gmail filters** to automatically **label** or **move newsletters** into a specific folder. Use search criteria like:
       ```
       subject:(unsubscribe OR "weekly update" OR "newsletter")
       ```
     - Set these emails to be automatically labeled and skipped from the inbox, making it easy to review and manually unsubscribe in bulk later.
   - **Limitations**: While this doesn't automatically unsubscribe, it helps to easily group all newsletters in one place.

### 5. **SaneBox**
   - **Overview**: **SaneBox** is an AI-powered email management tool that categorizes your emails. It has a feature called **SaneBlackHole** that allows you to unsubscribe from any unwanted sender by simply dragging the email into the SaneBlackHole folder.
   - **How It Works**:
     - After connecting your Google Workspace account, SaneBox sorts emails into folders like **SaneLater**, which often contains newsletters.
     - Drag unwanted emails to **SaneBlackHole**, and all future emails from that sender will be automatically deleted.
   - **Pricing**: Starts at **$7 per month**.
