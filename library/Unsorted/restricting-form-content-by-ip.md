Yes, you can use Cloudflare to limit access to URLs matching a specific pattern, such as `https://yourbusiness.cloud/dashboard/#/nc/form/*`, based on the IP's geographical location. This can be done by setting up a **Firewall Rule** in Cloudflare. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

### Steps to Set Up a Firewall Rule in Cloudflare:

1.  **Log in to Cloudflare**:
    
    *   Go to the Cloudflare dashboard and select the domain (e.g., `yourbusiness.cloud`) you want to configure.
        
2.  **Navigate to Firewall Rules**:
    
    *   On the left-hand side, click on **Security** > **WAF** (Web Application Firewall) > **Firewall Rules**.
        
3.  **Create a New Firewall Rule**:
    
    *   Click on **Create a Firewall Rule**.
        
4.  **Define the Rule**:
    
    *   **Name**: Give the rule a descriptive name (e.g., "Restrict Access to Form URLs").
        
    *   **Field**: Select **URI Path**.
        
    *   **Operator**: Choose **matches**.
        
    *   **Value**: Enter the URL pattern you want to match, for example, `/dashboard/#/nc/form/*`.
        
5.  **Add a Condition for Country Restriction**:
    
    *   Click on **Add Expression**.
        
    *   **Field**: Select **Country**.
        
    *   **Operator**: Choose **does not equal**.
        
    *   **Value**: Select the country or countries you want to allow access from (e.g., United States).
        
6.  **Set the Action**:
    
    *   Choose **Block** as the action to be taken if the conditions are met.
        
7.  **Save and Deploy**:
    
    *   Review the rule and click **Deploy** to activate it.
        

### Notes:

*   **Caveat with Hashed URLs**: The hash (`#`) part of the URL (e.g., `#/nc/form/*`) is not sent to the server and is usually handled by the browser. Therefore, Cloudflare might not be able to match rules based on the hash fragment. You may need to adjust your rule to match the base URL (`/dashboard/`) or use another identifier in the path if possible.
    
*   **Testing**: After setting up the rule, test access from different countries to ensure the rule is functioning as expected.
    

By configuring this rule, you can effectively control access to your application based on the user's geographical location.
