# Prompt

Great. Now that I've synced my Ansible playbook to Github, let's talk about what I'd need to do to use it to update the system configuration on my laptop, which is also running Fedora workstation 40

I just want to be clear on the objective. It's that the laptop will pull the config from my desktop and essentially mirror its package installations. If something was added to the desktop, it should be added on the laptop. If a package was uninstalled on the desktop, it should be removed on the laptop. The idea is to create a kind of sync from desktop to laptop.

# Output

Thank you for clarifying the objective. You're correct, and I apologize for any confusion in my previous response. Let's focus on setting up a system where your laptop pulls the configuration from your desktop and mirrors its package installations. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. On your desktop:
   - Ensure your Ansible playbook captures all installed packages, configurations, and any other relevant system settings.
   - Push this playbook to your GitHub repository regularly (which you've already set up).

2. On your laptop:
   - Install Ansible: `sudo dnf install ansible`
   - Clone your GitHub repository: 
     ```
     git clone git@github.com:danielrosehill/Ansible-playbook-for-desktop.git
     ```

3. Set up a scheduled task on your laptop to periodically pull and apply the configuration:
   - Create a script (e.g., `update_config.sh`) with the following content:
     ```bash
     #!/bin/bash
     cd /path/to/Ansible-playbook-for-desktop
     git pull
     ansible-playbook config.yml
     ```
   - Make the script executable: `chmod +x update_config.sh`
   - Set up a systemd timer to run this script periodically (e.g., daily):
     - Create a service file: `/etc/systemd/system/config-sync.service`
       ```ini
       [Unit]
       Description=Sync configuration from desktop

       [Service]
       ExecStart=/path/to/update_config.sh
       User=your_username

       [Install]
       WantedBy=multi-user.target
       ```
     - Create a timer file: `/etc/systemd/system/config-sync.timer`
       ```ini
       [Unit]
       Description=Run config sync daily

       [Timer]
       OnCalendar=daily
       Persistent=true

       [Install]
       WantedBy=timers.target
       ```
     - Enable and start the timer:
       ```
       sudo systemctl enable config-sync.timer
       sudo systemctl start config-sync.timer
       ```

4. Modify your Ansible playbook to handle package installation and removal:
   - Use the `dnf` module to manage packages.
   - For package installation:
     ```yaml
     - name: Install packages
       dnf:
         name: "{{ item }}"
         state: present
       loop: "{{ packages_to_install }}"
     ```
   - For package removal:
     ```yaml
     - name: Remove packages
       dnf:
         name: "{{ item }}"
         state: absent
       loop: "{{ packages_to_remove }}"
     ```
   - Maintain lists of packages to install and remove in your playbook or in separate files.

5. Consider using `ansible-pull` instead of a custom script:
   - Set up a cron job or systemd timer to run:
     ```
     ansible-pull -U https://github.com/danielrosehill/Ansible-playbook-for-desktop.git
     ```
   - This will automatically pull the latest version of your playbook and apply it.

Remember to test your playbook thoroughly to ensure it doesn't make unwanted changes to your laptop. Also, consider adding safeguards to prevent accidental removal of critical packages.

This setup will allow your laptop to periodically sync its configuration with your desktop, mirroring package installations and removals as defined in your Ansible playbook.

# Prompt

I'm confused. Do I need to modify the playbook that I've created on my desktop?

# Output

I apologize for the confusion. Let me clarify:

1. The current playbook:
   The playbook you've created on your desktop is designed to capture the current state of your desktop system, including installed packages, configuration files, and AppImages.

2. Do you need to modify it?:
   In its current form, the playbook doesn't need significant modifications. However, you might want to add a few tasks to make it more suitable for applying the configuration to your laptop.

Here's what you should consider:

1. Package management:
   - Add a task to install packages that are present on your desktop:
     ```yaml
     - name: Install packages from desktop
       dnf:
         name: "{{ item }}"
         state: present
       loop: "{{ lookup('file', 'installed_packages.txt').splitlines() }}"
     ```

2. Configuration files:
   - Ensure the playbook copies the configuration files to the correct locations on your laptop.

3. Flatpaks and AppImages:
   - Add tasks to install Flatpaks and AppImages listed in the respective files.

4. Removal of packages:
   - If you want to remove packages from your laptop that aren't on your desktop, you'd need to add a task for this. However, this requires careful consideration to avoid removing essential packages specific to your laptop.

The main idea is that the playbook should not only capture the state of your desktop but also be able to apply that state to another system (your laptop).

To use this playbook on your laptop:

1. Clone the repository on your laptop:
   ```
   git clone git@github.com:danielrosehill/Ansible-playbook-for-desktop.git
   ```

2. Run the playbook:
   ```
   cd Ansible-playbook-for-desktop
   ansible-playbook config.yml
   ```

3. Set up a scheduled task (as described in the previous response) to periodically pull and apply the configuration.
****
Remember to test the playbook carefully before applying it to your laptop to ensure it doesn't make unwanted changes. You might want to run it with the `--check` flag first to see what changes it would make without actually applying them.
