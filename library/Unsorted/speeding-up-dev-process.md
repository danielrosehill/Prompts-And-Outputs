I have a database in Supabase which has the basic framework for my Output Hub system. Here's the tool I would love to exist and which I'm looking for: something which can authenticate against the API and automatically determine the data structure that I have there and *then* provide an easy way for me to build a frontend. By "frontend" I mean CRUD pages for interfacing with the most important tables. Can you think of anything that could, if not do this, greatly speed up the development process?

# Output

If you're looking to develop the frontend of your Output Hub system yourself using a traditional development approach, here are some of the most popular and powerful frontend frameworks you can consider:
