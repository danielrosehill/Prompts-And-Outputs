The price difference between the **Be Quiet! Pure Base 500** with a **solid panel** and the **tempered glass window** version is fairly small. The solid panel version typically retails for around **$80 USD**, while the tempered glass version is priced slightly higher, at about **$85 USD**【119†source】【120†source】.

### Sound Insulation with the Tempered Glass Version
The **tempered glass** panel in the windowed version does not offer as much sound insulation as the solid panel. The solid version of the case has **noise-dampening mats** on the front, sides, and top, which improve its sound-dampening capabilities. The glass panel itself doesn’t have soundproofing material, so it may allow a bit more noise to escape compared to the solid panel version, although the case is still designed to be relatively quiet.

If sound insulation is a priority, you may notice a slight difference when switching to the glass version, but the impact may not be dramatic depending on your hardware's noise levels.
