# Prompt

No problem. So just to make sure that we're on the same page, we're going with MongoDB and Mongoose. And trying to build a frontend / CRUD admin panel .. ideally as simple as possible. I mentioned that I found AdminJS too complicated to set up and I'm looking for more options. React Admin looks interesting. Do you have any other ideas?

# Output

Based on your interest in React Admin and Vue.js admin frameworks, and considering your project requirements (MongoDB with Mongoose, looking for a simple admin panel/CRUD interface), here are a few more frameworks you might want to consider:

1. Ant Design Pro
   - Based on React and Ant Design
   - Supports MongoDB
   - Provides a rich set of UI components and templates
   - Good for building complex admin interfaces

2. Vue Element Admin
   - Based on Vue.js and Element UI
   - Can be integrated with MongoDB
   - Offers a variety of components and templates
   - Good for both simple and complex admin panels

3. Blitz.js
   - Full-stack React framework
   - Built-in support for MongoDB
   - Provides scaffolding for CRUD operations
   - Good for rapid development of admin interfaces

4. Redwood.js
   - Full-stack JavaScript framework
   - Can be used with MongoDB
   - Offers CLI for generating CRUD interfaces
   - Good for building scalable admin panels

5. Feathers
   - Lightweight web framework for Node.js
   - Works well with MongoDB and Mongoose
   - Can be used to quickly build RESTful APIs and real-time applications
   - Good for building custom admin interfaces

These frameworks offer various levels of abstraction and features. Some, like Ant Design Pro and Vue Element Admin, provide more out-of-the-box UI components, while others like Blitz.js and Redwood.js offer full-stack solutions that can speed up development.

Remember, the choice of framework depends on your specific needs, your team's expertise, and the complexity of the admin panel you're building. It might be worth creating small proof-of-concept projects with a few of these to see which one fits best with your workflow and requirements.
