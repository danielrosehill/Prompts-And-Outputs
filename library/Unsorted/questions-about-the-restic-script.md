# Prompt

what does this mean?
That the back ran successfully?

And you're sure this is set up in the right dirction (from my desktop to the server)?

subprocess ssh: Permission denied, please try again.

# Output

Based on the output you've provided, let's break it down:

1. "subprocess ssh: Permission denied, please try again.":
   This initial error suggests that the first attempt to connect via SSH failed, possibly due to an incorrect or missing SSH key.

2. "daniel@192.168.1.1's password:":
   After the initial failure, the system prompted for a password, which is the fallback authentication method when SSH key authentication fails.

3. "repository c4e96d49 opened (version 1)":
   This line indicates that after providing the password, the script successfully connected to the restic repository on the remote server.

4. The subsequent lines ("lock repository", "no parent snapshot found", etc.) are normal output from restic as it begins the backup process.

To answer your questions:

1. Did the backup run successfully?
   Based on this partial output, it appears that the backup process started successfully. However, to confirm that it completed successfully, we'd need to see the rest of the output, especially the final lines that should indicate completion and provide a summary.

2. Is it set up in the right direction (from your desktop to the server)?
   Yes, the direction is correct. The script is running on your desktop and backing up to the server at 192.168.1.1. This is evident from the SSH connection attempt to daniel@192.168.1.1.

Some observations and suggestions:

1. SSH Key Authentication: It seems that SSH key authentication isn't working, causing the script to fall back to password authentication. You might want to set up SSH key authentication to avoid entering a password each time.

2. Repository Already Initialized: The "repository opened" message suggests that the restic repository already exists on the server, which is good.

3. First Backup: The "no parent snapshot found" message indicates that this might be the first backup to this repository.

To ensure everything is working correctly:

1. Let the backup complete and check the final output for any errors.
2. After completion, you can verify the backup by running:
   ```
   restic -r sftp:daniel@192.168.1.1:/home/daniel/desktop_backups snapshots
   ```
   This should list the snapshots in the repository.

3. To improve the SSH connection, you can set up SSH key authentication:
   ```
   ssh-copy-id daniel@192.168.1.1
   ```
   This will copy your public key to the server, allowing passwordless authentication in future runs.

Overall, it appears the script is working as intended, backing up from your desktop to the server, but with a reliance on password authentication rather than SSH keys.
