# Prompt

One aspect of Obsidian that strikes me as very problematic is the fact that the system appears to rely on creating the files locally (even when it syncs). This creates a privacy risk because all the files are maintained on the end devices. If they are lost or stolen, your entire knowledge base becomes accessible. Secondly a capacity constraint is created. The storage of the devices must be enough to accommodate a growing note collection. And the larger that note collection becomes, the more spaces it takes up on the device. Do you agree? Can you think of some other tools that aren't limited in this manner?

# Output

Your concerns about Obsidian’s reliance on local file storage are valid, especially regarding privacy, security, and capacity constraints. Here’s a closer look at these issues and alternative tools that mitigate these risks:

### 1. **Privacy and Security Concerns**
   - **Local File Storage:** Because Obsidian stores notes locally, your entire knowledge base is as secure as your device. If the device is lost, stolen, or compromised, someone could potentially access all your notes.
   - **Encryption:** While you can encrypt your hard drive or use encrypted vaults, this adds complexity and may not fully address the risk if the device is left unlocked or compromised.
   - **Syncing Risks:** Even with Obsidian Sync or third-party syncing services (like Dropbox or Google Drive), notes are still stored locally on multiple devices, increasing the potential attack surface.

### 2. **Capacity Constraints**
   - **Device Storage:** As your note collection grows, it consumes more local storage. For users with limited disk space or large vaults, this can become a significant issue.
   - **Scaling Issues:** While markdown files are small, the number of files and their interconnections (e.g., backlinks, graph views) can strain Obsidian's performance, particularly on lower-end devices.

# Prompt 2

Do you think it's possible to achieve performant syncing of markdown notes on a remote server? Or would the latency be significantly noticeable compared to working on a local file?

# Output 2

Syncing markdown notes to a remote server can be achieved with good performance, but there are some considerations to keep in mind. Here's a breakdown of the factors that would influence performance and whether latency might be noticeable compared to working with local files:

### 1. **Factors Influencing Sync Performance**

#### a. **Network Latency**
   - **Impact:** The speed of your internet connection and the distance to the remote server will influence latency. For example, if the server is geographically distant or if your connection is unstable, you might notice delays when saving or accessing notes.
   - **Mitigation:** Using a server geographically closer to your location or with low latency (like a high-quality VPS or dedicated server) can reduce these delays. Ensuring you have a fast and stable internet connection is also important.

#### b. **File Size and Frequency of Changes**
   - **Impact:** Markdown files are typically small, so even frequent changes can be synced quickly. However, if you’re working with very large files or making constant, rapid edits, the syncing process might introduce some lag.
   - **Mitigation:** Incremental syncing (only syncing changes rather than whole files) can significantly improve performance. Tools that support this, like `Syncthing` or `Unison`, are beneficial.

#### c. **Syncing Tools and Protocols**
   - **Impact:** The tool or protocol used to sync files can greatly affect performance. Some tools are optimized for speed and efficiency, while others may introduce more overhead.
   - **Mitigation:** Using efficient syncing protocols like `rsync`, `Syncthing`, or tools that support block-level sync (where only parts of files that have changed are synced) can reduce the impact on performance.

### 2. **Comparison to Local File Access**

#### a. **Speed**
   - **Local Files:** Accessing and saving local files is nearly instantaneous because there’s no network dependency.
   - **Remote Sync:** Even with an optimized sync setup, there will generally be a small delay when accessing or saving files due to network latency. This delay may be more noticeable when opening or closing notes frequently.

#### b. **Reliability**
   - **Local Files:** More reliable because there’s no dependency on network availability. However, local files are at risk if the device is lost or damaged.
   - **Remote Sync:** Reliant on network stability. A dropped connection could delay syncing, though most tools handle reconnecting and resuming sync efficiently.

#### c. **Conflict Resolution**
   - **Local Files:** Minimal risk of conflicts since changes are made directly.
   - **Remote Sync:** Syncing tools must handle conflicts if files are edited from multiple locations before syncing. This is generally well-managed by modern tools but can still introduce complexity.

### 3. **Tools and Techniques for Effective Remote Syncing**

#### a. **Syncthing**
   - **Overview:** Syncthing is a popular, open-source tool that offers real-time syncing between devices. It’s peer-to-peer and supports secure, encrypted connections.
   - **Performance:** Generally very fast and efficient for syncing small files like markdown notes. Changes are synced incrementally, reducing the amount of data transmitted.

#### b. **Rsync with SSH**
   - **Overview:** `rsync` is a powerful command-line tool for syncing files over SSH. It’s known for its speed and ability to sync only the differences between files.
   - **Performance:** While not real-time, `rsync` is extremely efficient for periodic syncing of files. It can be set up with cron jobs for regular syncing intervals.

#### c. **Nextcloud or Seafile**
   - **Overview:** Both Nextcloud and Seafile offer cloud storage solutions with client-side syncing. They allow you to run your own cloud server with file synchronization.
   - **Performance:** Designed to minimize latency, especially for frequently accessed files. They also offer web interfaces and apps for accessing files on the go.

#### d. **Unison**
   - **Overview:** Unison is a file synchronization tool similar to `rsync` but designed for bi-directional syncs. It’s efficient at handling large numbers of small files.
   - **Performance:** Very efficient for real-time or near-real-time syncing across devices, with good conflict resolution capabilities.

### 4. **Practical Considerations**

#### a. **Caching**
   - **Local Caching:** Some tools (like Syncthing) can cache files locally, allowing you to work on them as if they’re stored locally while syncing in the background.
   - **Latency Management:** Even if there’s slight latency, using local caching can make the experience feel almost as responsive as working on local files.

#### b. **Offline Access**
   - **Hybrid Solutions:** Consider hybrid solutions where you work on local copies that sync with the remote server when a connection is available. This can offer the best of both worlds: local speed and remote backup.

#### c. **Scalability**
   - **Growing Collections:** As your collection of markdown notes grows, managing and syncing them effectively becomes more critical. Using tools that can handle incremental syncs and scale with your needs will help maintain performance.

### Conclusion
Yes, it’s possible to achieve performant syncing of markdown notes on a remote server, and the latency can be minimal if the right tools and practices are used. While working with local files will always be faster due to the absence of network latency, tools like Syncthing, rsync, and Nextcloud can make remote syncing almost as seamless, especially for small, text-based markdown files.

If your notes are critical and you need the advantages of both local access and remote backups, a hybrid approach with efficient syncing and local caching is likely the best solution.## Extracted Prompts
