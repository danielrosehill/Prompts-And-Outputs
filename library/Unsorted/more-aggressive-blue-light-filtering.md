My focus this week is on getting on a healthy sleep schedule. I love using my computer to work on side projects and write blogs, but even with the lowest brightness setting on my monitors, I think they're probably too bright and emitting too much blue light. I've already set the brightness on the monitors to the lowest setting and use a red light filter but I have the feeling it's not enough. In my office ... I think the ambient lighting is probably too bright too, but it's what the landlord installed. As the winter approaches, my wife and I would like to spend some more quality time with friends enjoying movies. I bought a pair of blue light glasses from Amazon as an experiment, but they look a bit ridiculous. Can you suggest some approaches I could try?

It's great that you're focusing on improving your sleep schedule and recognizing the potential impact of blue light exposure. Here are some suggestions to help address your concerns:

1. Monitor settings:
While you've already lowered the brightness, consider adjusting the color temperature of your monitors to a warmer setting, especially in the evening. Many computers have built-in features like Night Shift (Mac) or Night Light (Windows) that can automatically adjust this[1].

2. Lighting alternatives:
For your office lighting, consider using warm-toned LED bulbs or lamps with adjustable color temperatures. You could also use desk lamps or floor lamps with warmer light instead of the bright overhead lighting[9].

3. Blue light filtering software:
Install software like f.lux or Iris on your computer to automatically adjust screen color based on the time of day[1].

4. Evening routine:
Try to establish a wind-down routine that reduces screen time 1-2 hours before bed. This could include reading physical books, listening to podcasts, or engaging in relaxation exercises[7][10].

5. Natural light exposure:
During the day, try to get at least 30 minutes of natural light exposure. This can help regulate your circadian rhythm and improve sleep quality[7][10].

6. Movie viewing:
For movie nights, consider using a projector instead of a TV, as projectors often emit less blue light. Alternatively, adjust your TV's settings to a warmer color temperature in the evening[1].

7. Blue light glasses:
While the ones you bought might not be ideal, there are more stylish options available. Look for glasses specifically designed for evening wear with a slight amber tint[2].

8. Sleep environment:
Ensure your bedroom is dark, quiet, and cool (around 65Â°F). Use blackout curtains or an eye mask if needed[8][10].

9. Consistent sleep schedule:
Try to maintain a consistent sleep and wake time, even on weekends. This helps regulate your body's internal clock[10][11].

10. Evening activities:
Replace late-night computer work with less stimulating activities like gentle stretching, meditation, or listening to calming music[7][10].

Remember, it may take some time for your body to adjust to these changes. Be patient and consistent with your new habits for the best results.
