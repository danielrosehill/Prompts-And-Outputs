I'm glad you're finding them entertaining! Here are a few **more obscure messaging services** that might fit the bill, each with their unique quirks and fun features:

### **1. RetroShare**
- **RetroShare** is a **decentralized communication** and file-sharing platform. It includes **messaging, forums, and channels**, with a focus on privacy.

- **Platforms**:
  - **Linux (Fedora)**: Available in repositories (`sudo dnf install retroshare`).
  - **Windows**: Download from their official site.
  - **Android**: There's a companion app called **RS Android**.
- **Website**: [RetroShare](https://retroshare.cc/)

### **4. Jami (formerly Ring)**

### **5. Keybase**

- It’s quirky enough for teams that want to do things a little differently and for those who want better control over threaded conversations.
- **Platforms**:
  - **Linux, Windows, Android**: As mentioned previously.
