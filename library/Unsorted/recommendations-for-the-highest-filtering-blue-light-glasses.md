Your prompt asks for recommendations for the most "aggressive" light-filtering glasses, specifically one pair with FL-41 lenses and one pair with blue light filtering, without making the lenses too dark for indoor use.

Given your focus on filtering as much light as possible without overly darkening the view, I recommend the following options:

### 1. **FL-41 Lenses:**
FL-41 lenses are known for their rose tint, which reduces eye strain and sensitivity to light, particularly for those who experience migraines or are sensitive to fluorescent lighting. The goal here would be to get a pair with a **high percentage of FL-41 tint** for maximum light filtering, while still being able to see comfortably indoors.

- **Recommended Brands for FL-41 Lenses:**
  - **Axon Optics**: Offers a strong FL-41 filter specifically designed for those with light sensitivity. Their lenses are available in different levels of darkness, so you can choose a tint level suitable for indoor use. They are well-regarded for people with sensory overload issues.
  - **TheraSpecs**: Another brand that specializes in FL-41 lenses. Their **Indoor TheraSpecs** model offers a high level of filtering without being too dark for indoor activities.

### 2. **Blue Light Filtering Glasses:**
Blue light filtering glasses are designed to block harmful blue light from screens and other sources, reducing eye strain and helping with sleep disruptions caused by screen exposure.

For "aggressive" blue light filtering, you should look for lenses that block at least **90% of blue light** or **500nm blue light**, as these provide the most significant filtering.

- **Recommended Brands for Blue Light Filtering Glasses:**
  - **Swanwick (Swannies)**: Known for their high-quality blue light blocking lenses, Swanwick offers both day and night versions. Their night-time lenses are highly effective at blocking nearly all blue light, while the day lenses offer a more subtle filter that’s suitable for working indoors.
  - **Gunnar Optiks**: A well-known brand in the tech world. Their lenses come with various tints, including **Amber Max** for maximum blue light blocking, which would be your best bet for aggressive filtering without making the view too dark.

### Considerations for Both:
- **Lens Color and Tint Strength**: For both FL-41 and blue light filters, the lens color will be the deciding factor for how "aggressive" the filtering is. Rose-tinted lenses for FL-41 are quite effective, and amber or yellow lenses are ideal for blue light filtering, as they absorb the higher-energy blue light wavelengths.
  
- **Coating Quality**: Ensure that the glasses come with high-quality anti-glare coatings to enhance comfort, especially in low-light environments.

### Day and Night Alternation:
- **Day Use**: Consider using blue light filtering glasses during the day while working on screens. Swanwick’s day lenses or Gunnar Optik’s **Amber Tint** are great for this.
- **Night Use**: In the evening, switch to the FL-41 lenses, as they’ll reduce sensitivity to artificial light indoors. Alternatively, you can continue using the more aggressive blue light filter at night to minimize screen-related sleep disruption.

### Purchasing Options:
- You can order FL-41 glasses directly from **Axon Optics** or **TheraSpecs**. For blue light filtering, **Swanwick** or **Gunnar** offer excellent online purchasing options.

These should meet your needs for filtering and comfort.
