In the screen you're showing, you are defining the basic class information for your project. Here's what each field represents and how you should proceed:

### 1. **Class Name**:
   - This defines the name of the main window class for your application.
   - **Recommendation**: You can leave it as `MainWindow`, which is typical for a basic Qt application that has one main window. This is the standard naming convention and will be the class that handles your main window's UI.
   
### 2. **Base Class**:
   - This defines the parent class from which your window class will inherit. The default is `QMainWindow`, which provides a central widget, menu bar, toolbars, and status bars.
   - **Recommendation**: Leave this as `QMainWindow` since it is the most suitable for your application, providing you with the needed window structure.

### 3. **Header File (`.h`)**:
   - This is where the declaration of your `MainWindow` class and its functions will reside.
   - **Recommendation**: Keep the default name `mainwindow.h`.

### 4. **Source File (`.cpp`)**:
   - This is where the implementation of your `MainWindow` class will be written (the logic behind your UI).
   - **Recommendation**: Keep the default name `mainwindow.cpp`.

### 5. **Generate Form**:
   - This checkbox ensures that a `.ui` file will be created, which is where you will design the visual layout using Qt's drag-and-drop interface.
   - **Recommendation**: Keep this checked, as you will need the form for designing your app's interface visually.

### 6. **Form File (`.ui`)**:
   - This is the file where your visual interface design will be stored.
   - **Recommendation**: Keep the default name `mainwindow.ui`.

### Final Recommendations:
   - You can proceed with the default values on this screen:
     - Class Name: `MainWindow`
     - Base Class: `QMainWindow`
     - Header File: `mainwindow.h`
     - Source File: `mainwindow.cpp`
     - Form File: `mainwindow.ui`
   - After clicking "Next," you'll be able to move on to the next steps, where youâ€™ll start adding the widgets (like **QSplitter** and **QWebEngineView**) to create the split-screen layout.
