To avoid setting up services like MongoDB and other components manually, you can leverage solutions that **automate** the provisioning and management of development environments. Here are a few ways to streamline this process, saving you from setting up each service one by one:

### 1. **Docker + Docker Compose**
   - **What it is**: Docker allows you to containerize services (like MongoDB, Redis, ElasticSearch) and run them in isolated environments. With **Docker Compose**, you can define multiple services (e.g., database, search engine, backend, etc.) in a single YAML file, which can then be spun up with a single command.
   - **Why it's useful**: This is one of the easiest ways to manage multiple services for local development or small-scale deployments. You just need to write a `docker-compose.yml` file specifying the services, and Docker will pull the relevant images and set everything up.
   - **How to use**:
     - Install Docker.
     - Create a `docker-compose.yml` file that defines your services:
       ```yaml
       version: '3'
       services:
         mongo:
           image: mongo:latest
           ports:
             - "27017:27017"
           volumes:
             - ./data:/data/db
         elasticsearch:
           image: docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:7.10.1
           environment:
             - discovery.type=single-node
           ports:
             - "9200:9200"
         backend:
           build: ./backend
           ports:
             - "5000:5000"
           depends_on:
             - mongo
             - elasticsearch
       ```
     - Run `docker-compose up` and all services will be set up automatically.
   - **Pros**:
     - Highly flexible and works across different environments (local, cloud).
     - Easily scalable for development, staging, and production.
   - **Cons**:
     - May require learning Docker and Compose if you haven’t used it before.
   - **Use Case**: Ideal for local development or small teams needing flexibility and easy environment setup.

### 2. **Managed Cloud Services (e.g., MongoDB Atlas, AWS, GCP)**
   - **What it is**: Managed cloud services provide fully hosted solutions for databases, search engines, and more without the need to handle infrastructure. You can spin up instances of MongoDB, Redis, and ElasticSearch through providers like **MongoDB Atlas**, **AWS RDS**, or **Google Cloud Platform** with a few clicks.
   - **Why it's useful**: You don’t need to worry about maintaining the infrastructure. The cloud provider handles backups, scaling, security, and uptime, so you can focus on development.
   - **How to use**:
     - Set up a **MongoDB Atlas** instance: [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas).
     - Set up **ElasticSearch** on AWS via **Amazon OpenSearch Service**.
     - Use **AWS Lambda** or **Google Cloud Functions** to host serverless functions for smaller tasks.
   - **Pros**:
     - No infrastructure management required.
     - Scales easily as your project grows.
   - **Cons**:
     - Costs can add up as usage scales.
     - More suited for production, though you can use free-tier options for development.
   - **Use Case**: Best for production environments or if you don't want to manage services locally.

### 3. **Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) Solutions (Heroku, Vercel, Netlify)**
   - **What it is**: PaaS platforms handle application hosting and simplify service deployment with minimal configuration. **Heroku**, for example, supports add-ons like MongoDB, Redis, and ElasticSearch with a few clicks, while **Vercel** and **Netlify** provide seamless hosting for frontend and static apps.
   - **Why it's useful**: These platforms handle a lot of the deployment and scaling tasks for you. They can also be integrated easily with GitHub for CI/CD.
   - **How to use**:
     - Use **Heroku** to deploy backend apps and add MongoDB or ElasticSearch via their add-on marketplace.
     - Use **Vercel** for deploying frontends built with React, Vue, or other frameworks.
   - **Pros**:
     - Minimal configuration required.
     - Scalable hosting and quick deployments.
   - **Cons**:
     - Less control over infrastructure.
     - Add-ons may have higher costs compared to setting up your own services on the cloud.
   - **Use Case**: Ideal for smaller projects, prototypes, or for developers who prefer simplicity in deployments.

### 4. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Tools (Terraform, Pulumi)**
   - **What it is**: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like **Terraform** and **Pulumi** allow you to define cloud infrastructure (including services like databases and compute resources) in code, which can then be version-controlled and applied automatically.
   - **Why it's useful**: If you plan to scale to multiple environments or need repeatable, consistent infrastructure setups, IaC tools can automate this.
   - **How to use**:
     - Write a configuration file defining the resources (e.g., MongoDB instance, ElasticSearch, compute servers).
     - Apply the configuration to automatically provision the infrastructure in your cloud provider (AWS, GCP, Azure).
   - **Pros**:
     - Highly scalable and repeatable deployments.
     - Great for production environments.
   - **Cons**:
     - More complex to set up initially.
     - Requires familiarity with cloud infrastructure and IaC concepts.
   - **Use Case**: Ideal for teams managing multiple environments or working in a DevOps culture.

### **Recommendation for Your Project**

For a solo developer or small team looking to minimize setup complexity, the best options are:

1. **Docker + Docker Compose**: This is the most flexible and easy way to set up your MongoDB, ElasticSearch, and backend services in one go. It allows you to spin up a consistent development environment with minimal effort and provides a great foundation for future scalability.

2. **Managed Cloud Services**: If you’re looking for a hassle-free solution and don’t want to deal with infrastructure, start with **MongoDB Atlas** and **Amazon OpenSearch** (ElasticSearch). Use **Heroku** or **Vercel** for easy deployment of your backend and frontend.

If you’re aiming for long-term scalability and have complex infrastructure needs, then **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** with **Terraform** or **Pulumi** is a strong choice. However, that would be more beneficial as your project scales or if you want to set up infrastructure in a highly organized way.

### Final Thoughts
Using Docker or managed services will help you get up and running quickly, allowing you to focus more on development and less on infrastructure. Choose Docker if you prefer local development flexibility and managed services if you want a fully hands-off approach to infrastructure management.
