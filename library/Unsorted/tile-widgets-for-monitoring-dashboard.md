# Prompt

I'm building a monitoring dashboard to keep track of local news events. Are there any tools that can be used specifically for the purpose of creating embed objects out of web pages or social feeds for this purpose? I'm looking to create a tile based navigation so having quite a few of these would be helpful

# Output

Based on your requirements for creating a monitoring dashboard with embedded web content and social feeds, here are some tools and approaches that could be helpful:

1. Juicer:
Juicer is a social media aggregator that allows you to embed feeds from multiple social media platforms into a single customizable feed on your website. It supports various social networks and can be easily integrated into a tile-based layout[3].

2. Tagembed:
Tagembed is another social media aggregator tool that supports embedding RSS feeds, which can be useful for incorporating news sources. It allows you to collect feeds from over 20 platforms and customize their display[4].

3. RSS Feed Widgets:
Many content management systems and website builders offer RSS feed widgets that can be used to display news feeds. These can often be customized to fit a tile-based layout[5].

4. Custom News Feed Tiles:
Some dashboard platforms, like SharpTools, allow you to create custom news feed tiles by adding RSS feed sources[5].

5. JavaScript News Tickers:
For a more dynamic display, you could use JavaScript libraries to create news tickers that can be integrated into your dashboard tiles. These can be customized to fit your layout and design needs[7].

6. Embedded Social Media Widgets:
Most social media platforms offer official widgets that can be embedded directly into your dashboard. These can be styled to fit a tile-based layout[2].

7. Web Scraping Tools:
For more advanced customization, you could use web scraping tools to extract specific content from web pages and display it in your dashboard tiles. This requires more technical expertise but offers greater flexibility.

8. iFrames:
For simple embedding of entire web pages or specific sections, you can use iFrames. However, be aware of potential security and responsiveness issues with this approach.

9. API Integrations:
Many news sources and social media platforms offer APIs that allow you to fetch and display content programmatically. This approach offers the most flexibility but requires development skills.

10. Dashboard Platforms:
Consider using a dedicated dashboard platform like Geckoboard, Cyfe, or Datapine, which often come with pre-built integrations for various data sources and can be customized to create tile-based layouts.

When implementing these solutions, keep in mind:
- Respect the terms of service and usage rights for any content you embed.
- Consider the performance impact of embedding multiple external sources.
- Ensure your dashboard is responsive and works well on different devices.
- Implement proper error handling for cases where external content fails to load.

By combining these tools and approaches, you should be able to create a comprehensive monitoring dashboard with a tile-based navigation system that incorporates various news sources and social feeds.
