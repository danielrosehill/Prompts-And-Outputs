Yes, it's completely normal for installing and configuring applications—especially self-hosted ones like **Outline**—to involve a lot of debugging, fixing issues, and encountering unexpected roadblocks. Here’s why it often takes longer than expected:

### Why These Issues Arise:

1. **Complexity of the Stack**:
   - Many modern applications rely on multiple components (e.g., databases, caching, authentication) working together seamlessly. Even a small misconfiguration in one part (like Redis or PostgreSQL) can cause issues.
   - When using Docker, these components are containerized, which adds a layer of abstraction and potential networking/configuration issues that require troubleshooting.

2. **Environment-Specific Issues**:
   - Your specific environment (such as Google Cloud Platform, different versions of Docker, or configurations) may behave differently than the environment the developers used for testing.
   - GCP itself can have networking, security, or resource settings that require tweaking for certain services to work properly.

3. **External Dependencies**:
   - Applications like Outline often depend on third-party services for authentication (Slack, Google, etc.), which adds additional complexity when integrating those services.
   - Sometimes, these integrations have their own set of configurations, APIs, or dependencies that require setup.

4. **Documentation Gaps**:
   - While many open-source projects have documentation, it’s often not comprehensive or tailored to your specific use case, which leads to trial and error.
   - Some application documentation assumes familiarity with certain tools or technologies, which can result in more troubleshooting for users unfamiliar with the stack.

5. **Unexpected Errors**:
   - Even with clear steps, unexpected errors (e.g., networking issues, port conflicts, SSL issues) can pop up, especially when multiple systems are involved.
   - Debugging often requires checking logs, researching error messages, and applying fixes iteratively, which adds to the time.

### The Frustration is Understandable:
It’s perfectly natural to feel frustrated when things don’t work smoothly, especially if you’ve planned to complete the task in a day. Installation and setup can be unpredictable due to the reasons above, and even experienced engineers often spend time debugging and troubleshooting.

### Why It’s Valuable:
While it’s frustrating, this process:
- **Builds your technical problem-solving skills**: Every problem you fix improves your understanding of how these systems work.
- **Leads to a stable, custom solution**: Once everything is working, you'll have a setup that's tailored to your needs and well-understood by you, making future debugging easier.
- **Is common across IT**: Even experienced developers and system admins frequently run into these issues and take time to resolve them. In many cases, projects stretch across days or weeks due to the need for testing and refinement.

### How to Approach It:
1. **Break the process into smaller goals**: Focus on solving one issue at a time (e.g., getting Redis connected, configuring authentication) instead of aiming to finish everything in a day.
2. **Document your progress**: Just like we’re doing now, document each fix and step you’ve taken. This will be useful if you encounter similar issues in the future.
3. **Expect the unexpected**: Setting a flexible timeline with room for troubleshooting and learning can help ease frustration.

### Conclusion:
Yes, this is very common in the world of software installation and system configuration, especially with self-hosted solutions. The frustration is understandable, but the skills and understanding you gain in the process are invaluable, and over time, you’ll become more efficient at navigating these challenges.
