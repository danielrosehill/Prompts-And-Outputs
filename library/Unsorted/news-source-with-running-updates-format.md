Can you think of any platform that delivers updates about geopolitical developments in the middle east in a running update / newswire type format?  I'm looking for a news source to integrate into a monitoring dashboard

Based on the information provided and the nature of your query, here are some suggestions for platforms that provide real-time or frequently updated news on Middle East geopolitical developments in a format suitable for integration into a monitoring dashboard:

1. Reuters Middle East Live Feed: Reuters offers live, constantly updating news feeds that can be integrated into dashboards. They have specific feeds for Middle East news.

2. Al Jazeera Live Blog: Al Jazeera often runs live blogs for major ongoing events in the Middle East, providing frequent updates.

3. BBC News Middle East Live Updates: The BBC frequently runs live update pages for significant events in the region.

4. Twitter Lists: Creating a curated Twitter list of reliable Middle East news sources and journalists can provide a real-time stream of updates.

5. AP News Middle East Wire: The Associated Press offers a Middle East news wire service that provides frequent updates.

6. Bloomberg Middle East Live Blog: Bloomberg occasionally runs live blogs for major Middle East events, particularly those with economic implications.

7. Jerusalem Post Live Updates: For events specifically related to Israel and its neighbors, the Jerusalem Post often provides live update feeds.

8. Al-Monitor: While not strictly a live feed, Al-Monitor provides frequent updates on Middle East politics and could potentially be integrated into a dashboard.

9. Middle East Eye: Offers regular updates on Middle Eastern affairs, though not in a traditional newswire format.

10. MEMRI (Middle East Media Research Institute): Provides translations and analysis of Middle Eastern media, which could be valuable for a comprehensive dashboard.

For integration into a dashboard, you might want to look into RSS feeds or API access from these sources, if available. Some may require subscriptions for full access or integration capabilities. It's also worth noting that the availability and format of live updates can vary depending on current events in the region.
