# Prompt

I have two concerns with my quiet quitting plan: 1) Staying on top of emails 2) Preparing for weekly meetings with my boss, who usually expects me to have an agenda of things worthy enough for his attention Please give me thoughts on how to address both of these topics. That is to say: I'd like a way to check my email as infrequently as possible I'd like a way to prepare minimum effort agendas that don't commit me to take much action

### 1) **Minimizing Email Checking While Staying on Top of Emails**

Quiet quitting doesn’t mean you should entirely ignore your responsibilities, but you can definitely limit how much time you spend on tasks like email. Here are some strategies to help you **check email as infrequently as possible** while ensuring nothing critical is missed:

#### **Use a Time-Blocking Approach**
   - **Schedule Email Checking**: Set specific times of day for checking your email, such as **twice a day**—once in the morning (e.g., 10:00 AM) and once in the late afternoon (e.g., 3:30 PM). Outside of these times, close your email client or silence notifications.
   - **Focus on Key Emails Only**: During your email checking sessions, scan for emails from important contacts, especially your boss or any critical projects. Archive or snooze less important emails until your next scheduled check, ensuring you only respond to urgent matters.
   
#### **Set Up Filters and Rules for Automatic Sorting**
   - **Create Smart Filters**: Set up automatic filters in your email client to sort and prioritize messages. For example, emails from your boss or any high-priority clients should be marked as important and moved to a dedicated folder, while everything else can go into secondary folders.
   - **Use Labels and Color Coding**: Visually categorize emails so you can quickly see what’s truly urgent at a glance. For instance, mark anything from your boss in red and less important emails in gray or blue.
   
#### **Automate Responses**
   - **Set Up an Autoresponder**: If you're worried about not being responsive, set an automatic reply that politely informs people when they can expect to hear from you. Example: 
     > “Thank you for your email. I am currently focused on other tasks but will respond within the next business day.”
   - **Use Canned Responses**: Pre-write responses to common emails or requests so you can quickly respond without much effort. If you’re getting repeated requests for the same information, have a template ready to go.

#### **Delegate Low-Priority Emails**
   - **Delegate When Possible**: If you work with a team, delegate tasks or requests that come via email to colleagues whenever possible. You can cc or forward such requests with a polite note delegating action.

By implementing these methods, you'll be able to check emails far less frequently while staying on top of what's important.

### 2) **Preparing Minimum Effort Agendas for Weekly Meetings**

When quiet quitting, you want to create agendas for meetings that make you seem engaged while avoiding unnecessary commitments. Here’s how to create **low-effort meeting agendas** that don’t commit you to too much action:

#### **Use a Simple and Repetitive Agenda Structure**
   - **Create a Template**: Use a basic agenda template with headings like "Updates," "Challenges," and "Next Steps." Each week, simply copy and paste the template, making minimal updates.
   - **Limit Action Items**: Structure your updates in a way that doesn’t require much follow-up. For example:
     - **Updates**: Mention completed tasks or ongoing work, but frame them in a way that shows progress without committing to extra effort (e.g., "Continuing to monitor project X" or "Awaiting feedback from team Y").
     - **Challenges**: Mention minor, non-urgent challenges (e.g., "Still working through minor delays with vendor communication" or "Slight bandwidth issue, but manageable").
     - **Next Steps**: Include action items that are either ongoing or dependent on others (e.g., "Will proceed based on next week's feedback" or "Awaiting additional direction before finalizing").

#### **Focus on Strategic, High-Level Talking Points**
   - **Avoid Overcommitting**: Frame your agenda items around big-picture ideas or issues that are already being handled. This creates the impression that you’re managing important tasks without committing to lots of follow-up work.
   - **Use “Waiting On” Phrases**: When discussing next steps, use language that suggests you're waiting on others, such as, "Waiting on final input from the team," or, "Once I receive X, I’ll be able to move forward."
   
#### **Highlight Progress Over Initiatives**
   - **Lean on Reporting**: Focus on highlighting what’s already been done, rather than suggesting new initiatives. This keeps the conversation focused on past work rather than future commitments.
   - **Limit New Projects**: Avoid mentioning any new initiatives unless absolutely necessary. If you’re asked to take on something new, respond with, "I’ll review that and see how it fits with current priorities."

#### **Rely on Data and Metrics**
   - **Use Reports or Metrics**: If you can use existing reports or metrics, this is a great way to fill in your agenda without adding additional work. Example:
     - “This week, we’ve seen a 10% improvement in engagement from last month.”
     - “No significant changes in traffic, maintaining steady performance.”
   - **Reuse Data**: Don’t hesitate to reuse the same metrics or reports for multiple meetings if the numbers haven’t changed significantly.

#### **End With Questions or Clarifications for Your Boss**
   - **Turn It Back on Them**: Include a question or two for your boss at the end of the agenda to keep them engaged, such as:
     - “Is there anything you’d like me to prioritize next week?”
     - “Are there any updates on the strategic direction that I should align with?”
   - This creates the perception that you are attentive to their needs while also shifting the focus back to them.

### Example of a Minimum Effort Agenda:
```
**Weekly Meeting Agenda – [Date]**

1. **Updates**:
   - Continuing to monitor progress on [Project A], moving forward based on last week’s feedback.
   - Completed minor adjustments to [Task B], awaiting final review.

2. **Challenges**:
   - Small delay in vendor communications, but should be resolved by next week.
   - Resource constraints on [Project C], awaiting input from [Team D] to move forward.

3. **Next Steps**:
   - Will continue managing [Project A] as per the current plan.
   - Once I receive feedback on [Task B], will proceed with implementation.

4. **Questions for Discussion**:
   - Is there anything you’d like me to focus on for the upcoming week?
   - Are there any updates on [strategic initiative] that I should incorporate into my work?
```

This simple agenda:
   - Shows that you’re actively managing your current workload.
   - Introduces minimal new action items.
   - Allows you to subtly defer work by framing tasks as dependent on other teams or external factors.

### Conclusion
To **quiet quit** while maintaining the appearance of professionalism, streamline your email management with automation, filters, and scheduling while crafting low-effort agendas that satisfy your boss without creating extra work for you. By being strategic about what you focus on and how you communicate, you can minimize your workload and keep your boss satisfied while you focus on finding a better job.
