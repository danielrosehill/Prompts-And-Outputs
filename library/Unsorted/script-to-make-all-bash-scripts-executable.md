# Prompt

Can you create another shortcut for me please? I'm creating a scripts folder that's synced through github. It's a bit cumbersome that every time I save a new bash script that I have to go into the terminal to make it executable. Could you write me a script that I can put in the base of the main repo which would recurse into every subdirectory and if it finds any bash scripts to make them executable?

# Output

Hereâ€™s a Bash script you can place in the base of your repository to automatically make all Bash scripts (`.sh` files) executable in every subdirectory:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Script to recursively make all .sh files executable in the current directory and subdirectories

# Find all .sh files and make them executable
find . -type f -name "*.sh" -exec chmod +x {} \;

# Optionally print the files that were made executable
echo "The following .sh files have been made executable:"
find . -type f -name "*.sh" -exec ls -l {} \;
```

### Instructions:
1. Save the script as `make_scripts_executable.sh` in the base of your repository.
2. Make this script executable (just once):
   ```bash
   chmod +x make_scripts_executable.sh
   ```
3. Now, every time you want to make sure all `.sh` files in your repository are executable, run the script:
   ```bash
   ./make_scripts_executable.sh
   ```

This will recursively find all `.sh` files and apply `chmod +x` to them, ensuring that they are executable.

Let me know if you need any adjustments to this!
