To summarize: you're asking whether **Proxmox Backup Server (PBS)** needs to be set up as a separate host from a regular **Proxmox VE** (Virtual Environment) installation.

### Answer:
No, **Proxmox Backup Server (PBS)** does **not need to be on a separate host** from **Proxmox VE**. You can run both on the same physical machine, but there are **some considerations** to keep in mind.

### Options for Setting up Proxmox Backup Server (PBS):

1. **Running PBS on the Same Machine as Proxmox VE (Virtual Environment)**:
   - You can install **Proxmox Backup Server** as a **virtual machine (VM)** or **LXC container** inside **Proxmox VE** itself. This setup is often used for smaller environments where you want to maximize resource utilization.
   - **Advantages**:
     - Easy to manage: Both Proxmox VE and PBS are managed from the same host.
     - Efficient use of hardware: Saves you from needing an additional physical machine.
     - Can take **local backups** and **remote backups** using the same physical resources.
   - **Considerations**:
     - Make sure you have **enough storage** and **RAM/CPU** to run both the virtual machines (VMs) and PBS on the same machine.
     - If you have storage redundancy (like ZFS with RAID), this setup can be reliable, but avoid backing up to the same physical storage that the VMs are running on to reduce the risk of data loss.
  
2. **Running PBS on a Separate Machine**:
   - For larger environments or setups that need more **resilience** and **storage separation**, running **Proxmox Backup Server** on a **dedicated physical machine** or a **separate server** is recommended.
   - **Advantages**:
     - Better **isolation** of backup tasks and Proxmox VE operations.
     - Can be a better option if you want **dedicated hardware** for backups, especially if running frequent backups or handling large datasets.
     - Reduces the risk of **storage contention** or system performance degradation on the Proxmox VE host.
   - **Considerations**:
     - Requires separate hardware, which might be overkill for smaller setups.

### Conclusion:
- **Same host**: You **can run PBS and Proxmox VE** on the **same machine**, either by installing PBS in a **VM** or **LXC container**. This is suitable for smaller environments or where resource optimization is key.
- **Separate host**: In larger environments or when more **isolation** is needed, running **PBS on a separate server** is recommended for performance and redundancy.
