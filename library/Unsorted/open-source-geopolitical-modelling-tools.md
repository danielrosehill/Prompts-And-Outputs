*Note: this repository consists of the outputs of large language models (LLMs). In many cases, these are unedited or minimally edited. The information provided is for demonstrative purposes only and is intended to highlight constraints and capabilities in LLM applications and prompt engineering strategies.*


# Prompt

Governments and militaries must commonly engage in modelling various geopolitical developments. Do they use custom LLMs for this purpose? Are there any tools that are used for this purpose that are accessible to interested researchers or which are open source?

# Output

Based on the information provided in the search results, governments and militaries are indeed exploring the use of large language models (LLMs) for various applications, including geopolitical modeling and analysis. However, the use of custom LLMs specifically for this purpose is not explicitly mentioned. That said, there are some relevant points to consider:

1. Military applications of LLMs:
- The U.S. Air Force has used LLMs for wargaming and automatic summarization.
- The U.S. Marine Corps, in collaboration with Scale AI, created an LLM named Hermes to assist in military planning by synthesizing data, generating hypotheses, and refining courses of action.
- The U.S. Army is experimenting with generative AI in military video games to improve battle planning, using models like GPT-4 Turbo and GPT-4 Vision to provide information on battlefield terrain and details on friendly and enemy forces.

2. Challenges and concerns:
- Security and data privacy are major concerns for military and government use of LLMs.
- There are efforts to develop policy guidance for the use of generative AI and LLMs in military contexts to address security concerns and establish proper usage guidelines.

3. Open-source options:
While not specifically designed for geopolitical modeling, there are several open-source LLMs that researchers could potentially adapt for such purposes:
- LLaMA by Meta
- Mistral 7B by Mistral
- Falcon LLM by TII
- GPT-J by EleutherAI
- MPT by MosaicML
- BLOOM by BigScience

4. Custom solutions:
The search results suggest that government agencies are more likely to develop or commission custom solutions rather than relying on publicly available models due to security concerns. For example, the U.S. Army is working on new policy guidance for the use of generative AI to streamline operations while addressing security concerns.

5. Accessibility to researchers:
There doesn't appear to be mention of specific tools used for geopolitical modeling that are readily accessible to interested researchers or open-source. However, the trend towards open-source LLMs in general could provide a foundation for researchers to build upon for such applications.

In conclusion, while governments and militaries are exploring the use of LLMs for various purposes including geopolitical analysis, there doesn't seem to be widely available, purpose-built tools for this specific use case that are accessible to outside researchers. The focus appears to be on developing secure, custom solutions for military and government use, while leveraging some of the advancements in open-source LLM technology.
