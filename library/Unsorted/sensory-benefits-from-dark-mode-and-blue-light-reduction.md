# Prompt

I've recently begun using dark mode and blue light filters. I've found that these two adjustments have been really helpful in keeping me feeling calm and relaxed when researching and working on my computer. I looked for these things because I'm looking for ways to get on a better sleep schedule (and blue light disrupts circadian rhythms). But I've found that the benefits have extended beyond that, into what I might describe as "feeling less overwhelmed by sensory inputs". By reducing the "harshness" of the light coming from screens, I find I'm more focused, less likely to impulsively switch between tasks, am and less likely to become overwhelmed. I have ADHD and these have all been persistent challenges, so I'm very happy to have made these discoveries. Now, I'm really curious to know whether any research has been done into how simple UI adjustements like these can benefit those with ADHD, autism, and other conditions that affect how we process information. Accessability in IT is commonly thought of as being concerned primarily with the needs of those with impaired hearing or vision. But perhaps neurodiverse users has been a focus too. Any thoughts? And I'd love some more things to explore.

# Output

It's great to hear that dark mode and blue light filtering have made a meaningful difference for you! There is growing research on how these types of UI adjustments can benefit neurodivergent users, specifically those with ADHD, autism, and other conditions that affect sensory processing and focus.

### Research on UI Adjustments and Neurodivergence
While accessibility often focuses on visible or auditory impairments, there’s a broader movement in IT to address **cognitive and sensory accessibility**—which includes making tech work better for neurodivergent users. Here are some areas of interest:

1. **Sensory Overload and Light Sensitivity**:
   - Studies have shown that **bright light and high-contrast settings** can be overwhelming for people with ADHD and autism, who are often more sensitive to sensory input. Dark mode, lower blue light, and softer contrasts are thought to help reduce this overload.
   - Reducing blue light has also been linked to stabilizing circadian rhythms, helping manage symptoms of ADHD, which is often associated with sleep irregularities.

2. **Focus and Impulse Control**:
   - Reducing visual “noise” by using dark mode and filtered light can help people with ADHD sustain focus. Visual clutter, bright colors, and stark contrast are often reported to encourage task-switching and impulsivity. Calmer screens may help create a more controlled, focused workspace.
   - Research has pointed to **"cognitive load reduction"** through simplified, less stimulating UIs as a benefit for ADHD, helping users focus on tasks without feeling as compelled to switch.

3. **Mood and Sensory Regulation**:
   - For both ADHD and autism, researchers have explored the benefits of **personalized sensory environments**, which can include UI modifications. Controlled lighting can regulate mood and prevent the onset of sensory “overwhelm.”
   - Programs like the Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) standard are beginning to consider neurodiverse users, noting the value of dark mode and blue light reduction to make digital spaces less "harsh" and more inviting.

### Things to Explore Further

1. **Further UI Adjustments**:
   - **Contrast and Saturation Adjustments**: Experimenting with reduced saturation or softer contrasts can make interfaces feel even calmer.
   - **Text Size and Font Adjustments**: ADHD and autism can affect how information is processed visually. Customizing font sizes and line spacing may help create an even more comfortable reading experience.

2. **Focus Tools**:
   - **Focus Mode Extensions**: Tools like Focus Mode (available in certain browsers and applications) remove extra distractions, hiding non-essential elements on a page. This might further reduce task-switching.
   - **Timed Light Shifts**: Many neurodivergent individuals find benefit in automatically shifting screen color temperature based on the time of day, such as increasing warmth in the evening. This helps reinforce circadian cues and calmness over a day’s work.

3. **Visual Customization Tools**:
   - **Tools like Stylus (a browser extension)** or custom CSS can allow even more control over color and contrast on specific websites, which can be helpful if certain sites have disruptive color schemes.
   - **Window Tinting**: Some screen overlay apps or monitor settings add a light tint, giving the screen a more natural, paper-like feel, which can reduce sensory fatigue.

These adjustments make working on screens more accessible for neurodiverse users, especially when customized based on individual needs. It’s encouraging to see research and technology slowly addressing cognitive and sensory accessibility, and the benefits you’re experiencing show how impactful it can be.

# Additional questions

Great. 

Here are some more things I've been thinking about in this realm:

- Are there specific ways information can be laid out which is more friendly to those with ADHD or which has been proven to be more focus-friendly (I'm thinking specifically about things like document formatting)?

- Are there best practices or emerging standards in website design specifically catering to this population?
# Output

These are both great questions! There are indeed specific ways to structure information and design websites to be more ADHD- and neurodivergent-friendly. Here’s what current research and emerging best practices suggest:

### ADHD-Friendly Information Layout and Document Formatting

1. **Chunking Content**:
   - Break down text into **short sections** or “chunks.” Research shows that this reduces cognitive load and makes information easier to absorb.
   - Use **clear headers** and **subheaders** to organize content hierarchically, making it easy to scan and locate information.

2. **Use of Lists and Visual Anchors**:
   - Bulleted or numbered lists make information more digestible and create visual breaks that prevent fatigue.
   - Adding **icons or small visuals** next to key sections or tips can act as anchors, helping those with ADHD focus and remember content better.

3. **Whitespace and Margins**:
   - Generous **margins and line spacing** help avoid visual overcrowding, allowing readers to process content more comfortably.
   - **Whitespace between paragraphs** and sections gives the eyes a natural resting point and makes reading more manageable.

4. **Consistent Formatting and Style**:
   - Consistent font styles and sizes throughout a document avoid unexpected visual distractions.
   - **Sans-serif fonts** (like Arial or Verdana) are generally easier to read for those with ADHD. Choosing a slightly larger font size (12-14pt) can improve readability.

### Website Design Best Practices for Neurodivergent Users

1. **Clear, Minimalist Layouts**:
   - ADHD-friendly design favors **simplified, uncluttered layouts** without excessive elements that could draw attention away from the main content.
   - Design elements should be purposeful, with prominent calls to action that stand out, helping users focus on completing tasks.

2. **Consistent Navigation and Familiar Patterns**:
   - Keeping **navigation predictable** helps ADHD users avoid confusion or frustration. Horizontal menus or sticky navigation bars are popular because they are easy to find and reduce the need to scroll.
   - Avoiding pop-ups, sudden animations, or unexpected page changes minimizes distractions.

3. **Adjustable Visual Settings**:
   - Websites that allow users to switch to dark mode or change font sizes and contrast provide better accessibility, especially for those with sensory sensitivities.
   - For instance, high-contrast text options and low-stimulus color palettes reduce strain, enabling users to focus longer.

4. **Reduced Visual Noise and Highlights for Important Content**:
   - A “focus mode” (similar to Reader Mode in browsers) can hide extraneous elements and simplify the view.
   - Highlighting important content (e.g., using a subtle background color or outline) helps guide attention without overwhelming it.

### Emerging Standards and Guidelines

Some emerging standards are being established to improve accessibility for neurodiverse users, particularly within the **Cognitive Accessibility** standards under the **WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines)**. While WCAG currently focuses on cognitive impairments in general, the guidelines are increasingly recognizing sensory and attention-related needs.

Additionally, organizations like the **W3C’s Cognitive and Learning Disabilities Accessibility Task Force** are actively working on more detailed standards. These include recommendations for structured layouts, options for simplified views, and adjustments for color and contrast to support neurodivergent users.

### Further Reading and Tools to Explore

1. **WCAG 2.1 Cognitive Accessibility**: The latest accessibility guidelines, which address neurodiversity considerations.
2. **ARIA Live Regions**: Developers use ARIA live regions to update page sections without reloading the whole page, a feature that helps reduce disruption.
3. **Browser Extensions for Reading**: Tools like **Mercury Reader** (simplifies webpage content) and **Dark Reader** (for dark mode on any website) can be helpful for reducing visual noise.

These practices, alongside research-backed formatting, can help make digital information environments more accessible, intuitive, and friendly for people with ADHD and other neurodiverse conditions.
