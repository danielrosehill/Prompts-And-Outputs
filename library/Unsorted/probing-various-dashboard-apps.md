# Prompt

which of these has the biggest userbase? Also .. is there a search engine for finding open source projects?

# Output

Among the options I listed, **Dashy** and **Homer** appear to have the largest user bases based on GitHub stars, community engagement, and ongoing development.

### 1. **Dashy**
   - **Popularity**: **Dashy** has a growing community with more than 12,000 stars on GitHub, which suggests a large and active user base.
   - **Ongoing Development**: The project is frequently updated, has a vibrant community, and is actively discussed on forums for self-hosted applications. Dashy’s flexibility in dashboard creation (not just for monitoring, but also organizing apps and services) has made it particularly popular with self-hosters.

### Search Engine for Finding Open Source Projects:
To discover open-source projects, there are several platforms and search engines specifically designed for this:

1. **GitHub**:
   - GitHub’s built-in search allows you to filter by programming language, stars, and other criteria.
   - [GitHub Explore](https://github.com/explore) also offers curated repositories.

2. **GitLab**:
   - GitLab is another widely used open-source platform. You can search projects through the [GitLab Explore](https://about.gitlab.com/explore/) section.

3. **SourceForge**:
   - One of the oldest repositories for open-source software, [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/) allows you to search and download open-source projects across many categories.

4. **Libraries.io**:
   - **Libraries.io** is a specialized search engine for discovering open-source libraries and projects across multiple platforms.
   - [Libraries.io](https://libraries.io)

5. **Awesome Self-Hosted**:
   - A community-driven directory of self-hosted services and open-source applications.
   - [Awesome Self-Hosted](https://awesome-selfhosted.net)

These platforms and engines provide comprehensive ways to explore and find open-source projects based on different needs, whether for general software, specific programming languages, or self-hosting solutions.
