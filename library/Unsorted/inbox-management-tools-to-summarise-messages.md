Digest of email summaries to keep track of everything without needing to open each thread.

5. Missive

6. Gmail + Third-Party AI Tools

Description: While Gmail itself doesn't have built-in AI summarization (yet), you can integrate it with AI tools like:

Zapier + GPT: You can create automations with Zapier to summarize emails using GPT. When a new email arrives, it can be summarized and sent to you as a digest.

Flowrite: A Chrome extension that works directly in Gmail to generate summaries of emails or responses based on email content.


Why it helps: You can leverage AI to provide summaries within your Gmail inbox, reducing the anxiety around high-stakes emails.


Conclusion:

For a seamless experience, Superhuman or Shortwave would provide the most intuitive AI-powered email summaries with minimal setup. If you're open to a tool that integrates with your existing inbox (e.g., Gmail), tools like Zapier with GPT or Flowrite can also be good options.
