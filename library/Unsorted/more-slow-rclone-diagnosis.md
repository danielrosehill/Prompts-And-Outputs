# Prompt

I'm trying to do an "ls" command in the terminal where my drive is mounted (with rlcone) and it takes about 10 seconds to execute

# Output
If you're experiencing delays when executing commands like `ls` in a directory mounted with **rclone**, it could be due to several factors related to how rclone interacts with Google Drive and the filesystem. Here are some potential solutions and adjustments to improve performance:

### 1. Use `--vfs-cache-mode` Options
As you are using `--vfs-cache-mode full`, it might be worth experimenting with different cache modes:

- **Minimal**: Only cache file metadata, which may speed up listing.
  ```bash
  rclone mount yourbusinessaccounts: /home/daniel/Cloud_Drives/Google/Shared-Drives/DSR-Holdings-Accounts --vfs-cache-mode minimal
  ```
  
- **Writes**: Cache writes only, which can be faster for file listings:
  ```bash
  rclone mount yourbusinessaccounts: /home/daniel/Cloud_Drives/Google/Shared-Drives/DSR-Holdings-Accounts --vfs-cache-mode writes
  ```

### 2. Enable Directory Caching
You can enable directory caching to improve the speed of directory listings:

```bash
rclone mount yourbusinessaccounts: /home/daniel/Cloud_Drives/Google/Shared-Drives/DSR-Holdings-Accounts --vfs-cache-mode full --dir-cache-time 1h
```
This command will cache the directory structure for one hour, which should speed up repeated access.

### 3. Use `--vfs-read-chunk-size`
You can adjust the chunk size for reading files to potentially improve performance:

```bash
rclone mount yourbusinessaccounts: /home/daniel/Cloud_Drives/Google/Shared-Drives/DSR-Holdings-Accounts --vfs-cache-mode full --vfs-read-chunk-size 64M
```
You can experiment with different chunk sizes (e.g., 16M, 32M, 128M) based on your needs.

### 4. Test Network Speed
Since rclone is reliant on your network speed, check your current connection speed to ensure that the delay isn't related to slow internet:

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sindresorhus/modern-normalize/main/modern-normalize.css | pv
```
This command checks your download speed.

### 5. Avoid Excessive Metadata Operations
If you're running `ls` on a directory with many files, it may take longer to process due to API calls. Instead, you can use `ls -1` to reduce the amount of information being processed:

```bash
ls -1 /home/daniel/Cloud_Drives/Google/Shared-Drives/DSR-Holdings-Accounts
```

### 6. Background Operations
Consider running the mount in the background and using `&` so that the terminal remains responsive:

```bash
nohup rclone mount yourbusinessaccounts: /home/daniel/Cloud_Drives/Google/Shared-Drives/DSR-Holdings-Accounts --vfs-cache-mode minimal &
```

### 7. Use Different Tools for Browsing
If command-line access remains slow, consider using a graphical file manager (like Dolphin or Thunar) to navigate the mounted drive, as they might handle file listings more efficiently than command-line tools under certain conditions.

### Summary
Try adjusting the **vfs-cache-mode** and **dir-cache-time** options, monitor your network speed, and test with various chunk sizes. These tweaks may significantly improve the performance of file operations in your mounted Google Drive. Let me know how it goes or if you need further assistance!
