# Prompt

  
I posted some of the core details of my project for managing outputs on Dev Post. I think it was a great idea to post this somewhere other than Github. Perhaps you can suggest some additional places where I can post the project as I am working on it?

# Output
Certainly! For tech projects that aren't necessarily startups, there are several communities and platforms that cater to open-source, hobbyist, or research-oriented projects. Here are some suggestions:

1. GitHub: While you've already mentioned it, it's worth noting that GitHub isn't just for code hosting. You can use GitHub Discussions or the project's Wiki to share details and engage with the community.

2. GitLab: Similar to GitHub, GitLab offers project hosting and community features.

3. Open Source Initiative: They have forums and mailing lists where you can discuss open-source projects.

4. Hackster.io: While it's often associated with hardware projects, they also feature software projects, especially those related to AI and machine learning.

5. Hackaday.io: Another platform primarily for hardware projects, but they welcome software projects too, especially those that interface with hardware or have practical applications.

6. CodeProject: A community of developers where you can share articles about your project and get feedback.

7. Dev.to: A community of software developers where you can write articles about your project and engage with other developers.

8. LWN.net: A platform for Linux and open-source news. You can submit your project for coverage.

9. Slashdot: A news site for tech enthusiasts. You can submit your project for potential feature.

10. Lobsters: A community-driven link aggregation site focused on technology.

11. Sourceforge: While not as popular as it once was, it's still a place to host and showcase open-source projects.

12. FOSDEM: Free and Open Source Software Developers' European Meeting. They have call for papers where you can submit your project for presentation.

13. ResearchGate: If your project has academic or research applications, you could share it here to engage with the academic community.

14. ArXiv: If you write a technical paper about your project, you could submit it to ArXiv, especially if it has machine learning applications.

15. Python.org: If your project is Python-based, you could list it in the Python Package Index (PyPI) and engage with the Python community.

These platforms are more focused on the technical and open-source aspects of projects, rather than their potential as startups. They can be great places to share your work, get feedback, and potentially find collaborators who are interested in the technology itself.
