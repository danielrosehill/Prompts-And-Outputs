**Lighting Setup for Home Office with Desk Light and Overhead Light**

### **Requirements Summary**
Daniel wants a flexible lighting solution for his home office, incorporating both a **desk light** and an **overhead light**. The aim is to create a comfortable environment for **daytime productivity** and **nighttime relaxation**, with adjustable lighting options, including the ability to use red light to minimize blue light exposure.

---

### **Lighting Scenarios**
The lighting will be used in two main scenarios:
1. **Daytime Use**: Desk light and overhead light together for optimal brightness and productivity.
2. **Nighttime Use**: Desk light primarily, with the option to use the overhead light set to red for a relaxing, low blue-light environment.

---

### **1. Desk Light**
**Purpose**: Provide focused task lighting for both daytime and nighttime use.

#### **Daytime Use**
- **Lumens**: **1500 lumens** (sufficient for focused work and productivity).
- **Wattage**: **15-20W** (LED).
- **Color Temperature**: **4000K-5000K** (cool to neutral white) to enhance concentration and simulate natural daylight.

#### **Nighttime Use**
- **Lumens**: **1000-1500 lumens** (lower intensity for a comfortable evening work environment).
- **Wattage**: **10-15W** (LED).
- **Color Temperature**: **2700K-3000K** (warm white) to create a relaxing, cozy atmosphere that minimizes blue light.

**Bulb Type**: **Smart LED Desk Lamp Bulb** with adjustable brightness and color temperature. 

---

### **2. Overhead Light**
**Purpose**: Provide ambient lighting for the entire workspace during the day and an optional red light for nighttime use.

#### **Daytime Use**
- **Lumens**: **3000-4000 lumens** to cover the entire workspace adequately.
- **Wattage**: **30-40W** (LED).
- **Color Temperature**: **4000K-5000K** (neutral to cool white) for overall ambient lighting that complements the desk light.

#### **Nighttime Use (Optional)**
- **Color**: **Red Light** to reduce blue light exposure and create a relaxing environment if needed.
- **Dimming Capability**: The overhead light should be **fully dimmable** to avoid being too bright at night.

**Bulb Type**: **Smart RGB LED Ceiling Light** capable of:
- **RGB Colors**: Including **red light** for nighttime use.
- **Adjustable White Light**: From **2700K to 6500K** to suit different activities throughout the day.
- **Control System**: **Smartphone app** or integration with **Home Assistant** for easy switching between colors, brightness, and modes.

---

### **Suggested Lighting Setup**
- **Desk Light**: Use a **smart LED desk lamp** with **adjustable brightness** and **color temperature** to provide focused lighting at different times of the day.
  - For **daytime**, set the desk lamp to **1500 lumens** and **cool white** (4000K-5000K).
  - For **nighttime**, reduce brightness to **1000-1500 lumens** and switch to **warm white** (2700K-3000K).

- **Overhead Light**: Install a **smart RGB LED ceiling light** for flexible ambient lighting.
  - For **daytime**, set the overhead light to **3000-4000 lumens** with a **neutral to cool white** (4000K-5000K) to brighten the entire workspace.
  - For **nighttime**, you can optionally use the overhead light set to **red** and dimmed for a calming effect.

### **Control Integration**
- **Home Assistant**: Integrate both the **desk lamp** and **overhead light** with **Home Assistant** for centralized control.
  - **Daytime Mode**: Activate both lights with appropriate brightness and color temperature for productivity.
  - **Nighttime Mode**: Switch to the **desk lamp** only, or add the **overhead light** in **red** if needed for extra ambient light.
- **Smartphone App**: Use the manufacturerâ€™s app to manually adjust brightness and color or set **automated schedules** to switch lighting modes based on the time of day.

### **Summary**
- **Desk Light**: Flexible task lighting for both day and night, with adjustable brightness and color temperature.
- **Overhead Light**: Provides bright ambient lighting for daytime and can switch to a **red, dimmed light** for optional nighttime use.
- **Control Options**: Use **Home Assistant** or a **smartphone app** to manage the lights seamlessly, ensuring the right lighting atmosphere for different times of the day.

This setup ensures that your workspace is well-lit for **daytime productivity** and can be easily adjusted for **nighttime relaxation** with minimal blue light exposure. Let me know if you need more specific product recommendations or help with setting up the integration!
