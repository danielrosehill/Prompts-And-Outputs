You can achieve this by combining the **`mkdir -p`** command with **`rsync`** in a single line. The `mkdir -p` command ensures that the target backup directory is created if it doesn't already exist.

Hereâ€™s the combined command:

```bash
mkdir -p homeboxdata_backup && rsync -av --info=progress2 homeboxdata/ homeboxdata_backup/

```

### Explanation:
- **`mkdir -p homeboxdata_backup`**: This creates the `homeboxdata_backup` directory if it doesn't already exist. The `-p` option ensures no error is thrown if the directory already exists.
- **`&&`**: Ensures that `rsync` will only run if the `mkdir` command is successful.
- **`rsync -av --progress homeboxdata/ homeboxdata_backup/`**: This performs the backup as discussed previously, copying the contents of `homeboxdata` into `homeboxdata_backup`.

This way, you ensure that the destination directory is created if it doesn't already exist before starting the backup process.
