# Prompt

Are there any news display widgets and or ticker elements that are free and which can be integrated into monitoring dashboards? I'm looking for a feed that shows important geopolitical developments in the middle east



# Output

Based on your query, there are a few options for integrating free news display widgets or ticker elements showing geopolitical developments in the Middle East into monitoring dashboards:

1. RSS Feeds: Many news organizations offer free RSS feeds that can be integrated into dashboards. For Middle East news, you could use feeds from sources like:
- BBC Middle East News
- Al Jazeera Middle East News
- Reuters Middle East News

These can be displayed as scrolling tickers or news lists using JavaScript libraries like jQuery News Ticker.

2. Twitter Widgets: Twitter offers free embeddable timeline widgets that can display tweets from specific accounts or hashtags related to Middle East news. You could create a widget following accounts of major news outlets or journalists covering the region.

3. Open Source News Tickers: There are open-source JavaScript libraries like jQuery.newsTicker or Easy Ticker that allow you to create customizable news tickers. You can populate these with Middle East news from free API sources.

4. News APIs: Some news aggregators offer free tiers for their APIs, which you could use to fetch headlines. For example:
- NewsAPI.org (limited free tier)
- Currents API (free for non-commercial use)

You'd need to filter these for Middle East content.

5. Custom Web Scraping: With some development work, you could create a custom scraper to pull headlines from trusted news sites covering the Middle East and display them in a ticker format.

When implementing any of these, be sure to respect the terms of service of the news sources and APIs you're using. For a production environment, you may need to consider paid options to ensure reliability and compliance with usage terms.
