*Note: this repository consists of the outputs of large language models (LLMs). In many cases, these are unedited or minimally edited. The information provided is for demonstrative purposes only and is intended to highlight constraints and capabilities in LLM applications and prompt engineering strategies.*


Please describe the aspect ratios and pixels that DALLE can generate at. Please provide prompt snippets explaining how to request specific aspect ratios.

# Output

**DALL-E** can generate images in the following **aspect ratios** and **pixel dimensions**:

1. **Square**: 
   - **1024 x 1024 pixels**.
   - This aspect ratio is 1:1, perfect for balanced compositions without favoring width or height.
   - **Prompt Snippet**: *"Create a square image of..."*

2. **Landscape (Wide)**: 
   - **1792 x 1024 pixels**.
   - This aspect ratio is 16:9, which is suitable for wide, landscape-oriented images. It works well for scenes that require more horizontal space.
   - **Prompt Snippet**: *"Generate a wide-angle image of..." or "Create a landscape-oriented image of..."*

3. **Portrait (Tall)**: 
   - **1024 x 1792 pixels**.
   - This aspect ratio is ideal for vertical, portrait-oriented images, making it useful for subject-focused compositions.
   - **Prompt Snippet**: *"Generate a portrait-oriented image of..." or "Create a tall image of..."*

### Prompt Snippets for Aspect Ratios:
1. **Square (1:1 aspect ratio)**
   - *"Generate a square image of a sloth sitting at a desk."*

2. **Landscape (16:9 aspect ratio)**
   - *"Generate a landscape-oriented photo of a family of sloths building a sukkah."*
   - *"Create a wide-angle image of a bustling marketplace."*

3. **Portrait (9:16 aspect ratio)**
   - *"Generate a portrait-oriented image of a sloth lighting Shabbat candles."*
   - *"Create a tall image of a mountain climber reaching the peak."*

These prompt snippets will help DALL-E understand your desired aspect ratio and orientation to better match your requirements for the generated image.
