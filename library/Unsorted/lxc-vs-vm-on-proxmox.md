To summarize: you're asking whether it's better to run **LXC containers**, **VMs**, or another approach for hosting multiple local services on a **Proxmox** host.

### Overview of Proxmox Options:

#### 1. **LXC Containers (Linux Containers)**:
   - **Lightweight**: LXC containers are more resource-efficient than VMs. They share the host system's kernel, which makes them much lighter on CPU, memory, and storage.
   - **Performance**: Since they run directly on the host's kernel, LXC containers offer **near-native performance**.
   - **Use Case**: LXC is great for services that donâ€™t need a full virtualized environment, such as:
     - Web services (NGINX, Apache).
     - Databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL).
     - Lightweight applications like **Heimdall**, **Dashy**, or **Home Assistant**.
   - **Limitations**: 
     - Limited kernel-level isolation (compared to VMs). If you need complete isolation or if you're running services requiring different kernels, LXC might not be suitable.
     - Less support for non-Linux operating systems.

#### 2. **Virtual Machines (VMs)**:
   - **Full Isolation**: VMs provide complete isolation with a separate virtualized hardware stack, which includes its own kernel. This makes VMs ideal for running **different operating systems** or services that require higher isolation for security or compatibility reasons.
   - **More Resource Intensive**: VMs require more CPU, RAM, and storage compared to LXC containers because each VM runs its own full OS, including a separate kernel.
   - **Use Case**: VMs are better for:
     - Services requiring **different OS kernels** or **different operating systems** (e.g., Windows, FreeBSD).
     - Applications that require complete **security isolation** (e.g., running sensitive services).
     - Running **heavy workloads** or services that might cause conflicts if shared on the same kernel as other services.

#### 3. **Combination (Hybrid)**:
   - In many setups, combining **LXC containers** for lightweight tasks and **VMs** for specific, resource-intensive services can give you the best of both worlds.
   - **Example**:
     - Run **LXC containers** for services like NGINX, databases, or local dashboards.
     - Use **VMs** for tasks that require more **security isolation**, **non-Linux environments**, or **resource-heavy** workloads like running a VM for a dedicated **home server** or **development environment**.

### Pros and Cons:
| **Feature**          | **LXC Containers**                         | **VMs**                                    |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Performance**      | Near-native, lightweight                   | Slower due to full virtualization          |
| **Resource Usage**   | Low resource overhead                      | Higher resource overhead                   |
| **Isolation**        | Moderate isolation (shared kernel)         | Strong isolation (separate OS and kernel)  |
| **Kernel Flexibility**| Linux-based only                          | Can run different kernels and OS types     |
| **Setup Complexity** | Easier to set up for Linux services        | More complex and resource-intensive        |
| **Use Case**         | Lightweight apps, databases, web services  | Heavy applications, different OS, isolation|

### When to Use **LXC**:
- For **Linux-based services** that don't need full isolation.
- When you want to run many **lightweight services** on the same machine (e.g., web services, small databases, dashboards like Heimdall).
- When you want **minimal resource usage**.

### When to Use **VMs**:
- When you need to run services that require **different operating systems** or **kernels**.
- For applications that demand **full security isolation** (e.g., sensitive services).
- When running **resource-heavy** applications or services that might conflict with others on the same system.

### Recommendation: **Hybrid Approach**
- Use **LXC containers** for lightweight, non-sensitive services (e.g., dashboards, small web servers, or databases).
- Use **VMs** for heavier or more sensitive services (e.g., non-Linux services, development environments, or security-critical applications).

This combination allows you to optimize for both **performance** and **resource efficiency**, while maintaining flexibility for different use cases.
