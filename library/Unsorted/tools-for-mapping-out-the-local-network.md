It's getting a little tricky to administer my local network. I think I have about 20 or 30 devices now spanning various categories - ioT sensors, gateways etc. 
can you think of any tool I could install on the ubuntu vm for the purpose of keeping track of what's on the network and perhaps managing IPs? Or would it be better to just use a custom router for this

# Output

To **keep track of devices** on your network and manage **IP addresses**, you have two main options: **installing software on the Ubuntu VM** or using a **custom router**. Let’s explore both approaches:

### Option 1: Software Tools for Ubuntu VM
Here are some tools that you can install on your Ubuntu VM to **monitor** and **manage devices** on your network:

#### 1. **NetBox**
   - **Overview**: **NetBox** is an open-source tool for **IP address management (IPAM)** and **network management**. It is highly useful for larger networks to document IP allocations, track devices, and even manage virtual environments.
   - **Features**:
     - Manage **IP address allocations** and **network topology**.
     - Document **network devices** such as switches, gateways, IoT devices, and sensors.
   - **Why It Fits**: It is a powerful, user-friendly solution that allows you to **document and track** every device, helping you understand the current state of your network without a custom router.
   - **Installation**: Install NetBox on your Ubuntu VM following [NetBox documentation](https://netbox.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

#### 2. **OpenNMS or Zabbix**
   - **Overview**: **OpenNMS** and **Zabbix** are network monitoring tools that provide comprehensive views of your entire network, with capabilities for device discovery and health monitoring.
   - **Features**:
     - **Automatic Device Discovery**: Automatically detect and map all devices on your network.
     - **IP Management and Monitoring**: Provides real-time monitoring and visualization of device performance and alerts for unusual activities.
   - **Why It Fits**: These tools go beyond IP management to offer monitoring of network health, making them perfect for networks with many **IoT devices** that need close tracking.
   - **Installation**: You can install either **Zabbix** or **OpenNMS** on your Ubuntu VM and configure it for your network. Both offer detailed documentation for setup.

#### 3. **Pi-hole + DHCP**
   - **Overview**: **Pi-hole** is typically used as a network-wide ad blocker but can also handle **DNS** and **DHCP** for your entire network. It provides a simple interface for managing devices and monitoring network requests.
   - **Features**:
     - Offers **DHCP** server capability, which allows you to assign **static IPs** to critical devices.
     - Monitor **network traffic** to identify and categorize devices.
   - **Why It Fits**: **Pi-hole** is a good lightweight solution if you want a **basic overview** of devices and to manage DHCP assignments without too much setup.
   - **Installation**: Install Pi-hole on your Ubuntu VM and enable the **DHCP server** to manage IPs.

#### 4. **Nmap + GUI Frontend (Zenmap)**
   - **Overview**: **Nmap** is a network scanning tool that can give you detailed information about all devices on your network. **Zenmap** is the graphical interface for **Nmap**.
   - **Features**:
     - Use Nmap for **scanning** the network to list devices, services, and IPs.
     - Offers **real-time scanning** to detect new devices.
   - **Why It Fits**: It’s a simple way to periodically check what’s on your network. However, it doesn’t provide IP address management.
   - **Installation**: Use `sudo apt install nmap zenmap` to install these tools on your Ubuntu VM.

### Option 2: Custom Router for Network Management
Using a **custom router** for network management is another option, which allows you to centrally manage **all IPs and devices** at the network level.

#### 1. **OpenWrt** or **pfSense**
   - **OpenWrt** and **pfSense** are popular open-source firmware/software for managing custom routers. These options provide:
     - **DHCP Management**: Easily manage and assign **static IP addresses** to all devices in the network.
     - **Real-Time Monitoring**: View connected devices, monitor traffic, and manage rules.
     - **Device Prioritization**: Assign **QoS** (Quality of Service) for priority services, such as Home Assistant or NAS access.
   - **Why It Fits**: Using a custom router lets you manage **all devices** on your network from a central place, making it easier to handle things like IP allocation and bandwidth prioritization.
   - **Hardware**: You can use a mini PC or purchase a **dedicated router** compatible with **OpenWrt** or **pfSense**.

### Recommended Setup
Since you want centralized network management for your growing network of 20-30 devices, here's a potential hybrid solution:

1. **Deploy NetBox or Zabbix on Your Ubuntu VM**:
   - Use **NetBox** for managing **IP addresses** and documenting your network.
   - Use **Zabbix** to **monitor** the performance and health of all connected devices, including IoT sensors, gateways, etc.

2. **Custom Router with OpenWrt or pfSense**:
   - Install **OpenWrt** or **pfSense** on a custom router or compatible hardware.
   - Use this to manage **DHCP**, **static IP assignments**, **firewall rules**, and **bandwidth monitoring**.

3. **Integrate Pi-hole for DNS**:
   - Run **Pi-hole** on your Ubuntu VM to provide **DNS** for your network, helping to filter ads and track **DNS requests** from all connected devices.
   - Pi-hole can also handle **DHCP**, providing basic IP address management for simpler requirements.

### Summary
- For **tracking and managing IP addresses** centrally, **NetBox** is an excellent choice for IPAM, while **Zabbix** or **OpenNMS** offer comprehensive monitoring and device management.
- If you prefer an **integrated hardware solution**, using a **custom router** with **OpenWrt** or **pfSense** will let you manage everything from DHCP to monitoring all devices directly at the network level.
- You can also integrate **Pi-hole** as a DNS provider to add an extra layer of monitoring for DNS queries and simple device identification.

These solutions should help you better manage and administer your expanding local network with greater ease and flexibility. Let me know if you need any guidance on setting up any of these tools!
