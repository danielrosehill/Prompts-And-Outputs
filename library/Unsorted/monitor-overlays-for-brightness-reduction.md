# Prompt

I was asking specifically about physical overlays. Can you suggest some for this purpose 

# Output

Here are some physical overlays and filters designed to reduce brightness, glare, and eye strain for monitors:

### 1. **Anti-Glare Screen Protectors**
   These protectors are specifically designed to reduce glare and soften the brightness of the screen by diffusing harsh light. They are usually easy to install and can help reduce reflections and the overall brightness of a screen.

   - **Vintez Anti-Glare Screen Filter**: 
     - Available in various sizes, these filters reduce glare and help to soften screen brightness.
     - Anti-scratch, anti-fingerprint, and provides some level of privacy protection.

### 2. **Blue Light and Glare Reducing Filters**
   These types of filters not only reduce screen brightness but also cut down on blue light, which can contribute to eye strain, especially when using screens at night.

### 3. **Privacy Filters (with Brightness Reduction)**
   Privacy filters are designed to prevent others from seeing your screen, but many of these also act as a brightness and glare reducer due to their matte or darkened finish.

   - **SightPro Privacy Filter**:
     - A matte filter that reduces brightness, glare, and provides privacy.
     - Typically reduces screen brightness by 30-40%, making it useful for dimming your screen further.

### 4. **Matte Finish Screen Protectors**
   Matte-finish protectors soften the brightness and reduce the overall harshness of the screen, making it more comfortable for long viewing periods.

   - **Kantek Anti-Glare Monitor Filter**:
     - A matte finish filter that reduces glare and brightness.
     - Fits different screen sizes and is easy to attach.
     - Also helps reduce reflection from windows and lights.

### 5. **Dim It Monitor Light Dimming Sheets**
   These are unique sheets designed specifically to reduce the brightness of monitors and TVs.

   - **Dim It Monitor Light Dimming Sheets**:
     - These sheets are placed directly over the screen and are designed to dim the overall brightness significantly without affecting color accuracy.
     - Available in different sheet sizes, which can be cut to fit any screen.
     - Particularly useful for very bright monitors that need extra dimming.
     - [Available on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com)

### 6. **3M High Clarity Privacy Filter**
   - This is a high-clarity screen filter that reduces blue light and adds a layer of privacy while also dimming brightness slightly.
   - High transparency while reducing brightness for those who prefer to maintain sharp colors.

### Factors to Consider:
- **Size Compatibility**: Ensure you buy the correct size for your monitor (check dimensions carefully).
- **Ease of Installation**: Many filters are either adhesive or use clips to attach to your monitor, making them easy to remove when needed.
- **Blue Light Reduction**: If you're sensitive to blue light, consider a filter that reduces both brightness and blue light.
- **Matte vs. Glossy Finish**: Matte filters are typically better for reducing glare and brightness.

These physical overlays should help in reducing the brightness of your monitors beyond their settings while also minimizing eye strain. Let me know if you'd like help finding specific options or brands!

# Input
