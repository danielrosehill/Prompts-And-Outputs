*Note: this repository consists of the outputs of large language models (LLMs). In many cases, these are unedited or minimally edited. The information provided is for demonstrative purposes only and is intended to highlight constraints and capabilities in LLM applications and prompt engineering strategies.*


# Prompt

Can you recommend a way that I might with to collect and curate my own personal SOP collection? I could definitely use a lot of these docs for things like taking backups and other procedures that are sometimes hard to remember. I think cloud hosted would be the best option. And given that I'm already looking to find a place to store all my LLM outputs maybe it could all be rolled into one cohesive wiki

# Output

That sounds like a great idea to streamline your workflows and consolidate your knowledge into one cohesive platform! Here are some recommendations for creating and curating a personal SOP collection in a cloud-hosted environment that could also house your LLM outputs:

### **1. Notion**
   - **Why It Fits**: Notion offers a flexible, **wiki-like structure** that allows you to organize SOPs, guides, and outputs from LLMs in an easily searchable database.
   - **Features**:
     - **Rich Media**: Supports text, images, files, and embeds, which makes it great for storing detailed SOPs.
     - **Templates**: You can create custom templates for SOPs that maintain a consistent format.
     - **Database Integration**: Tagging and organizing different SOPs with metadata is easy, which is great for quickly accessing needed procedures.
   - **Cloud and Collaboration**: Available on all devices, cloud-hosted, and easy to share or collaborate on when needed.

### **2. Obsidian with a Cloud Backup**
   - **Why It Fits**: Since you already use Obsidian, itâ€™s a natural fit. It works offline but can be synced using **Obsidian Sync**, **Dropbox**, or **Google Drive** for cloud-hosted backups.
   - **Features**:
     - **Interlinked Notes**: You can create a **personal wiki** with linked notes, which makes accessing related SOPs or documents efficient.
     - **Markdown-Based**: Stores everything in markdown, making it lightweight and easy to back up.
     - **Plugins**: Obsidian has several plugins that can be used to convert it into a full-featured **knowledge repository** for LLM outputs and personal SOPs.
   - **Cloud Syncing**: Use plugins like **Syncthing** or third-party storage for seamless syncing across devices.

### **3. Nuclino**
   - **Why It Fits**: **Nuclino** offers a clean, easy-to-use interface and works well for creating a **team wiki** or a **knowledge base**.
   - **Features**:
     - **Lightweight Wiki**: Easy linking of pages allows you to build a cohesive wiki of procedures, SOPs, and insights.
     - **Structured Hierarchy**: You can use collections, workspaces, and tags to easily separate LLM outputs, backups, and different categories of SOPs.
     - **Collaborative**: If you ever want to share some of your procedures with others, Nuclino supports real-time collaboration.

### **4. Notable**
   - **Why It Fits**: **Notable** is a markdown-based note-taking application with a focus on simplicity and organization. It can work similarly to Obsidian but offers cloud-hosted options via integrations.
   - **Features**:
     - **Organized Notes**: Great for capturing LLM outputs and storing them with SOPs.
     - **Tagging and Linking**: Similar to a wiki system, which helps organize SOPs by function (e.g., backups, security, routine tasks).
     - **Cloud Hosted**: Notes can be synced to **Dropbox**, **OneDrive**, or **Google Drive** for storage and availability across devices.

### **5. Confluence by Atlassian**
   - **Why It Fits**: Confluence is a well-known tool for creating **internal wikis**, often used by teams but equally useful for individuals.
   - **Features**:
     - **Full Wiki Capabilities**: Create pages for SOPs, LLM outputs, and link them together.
     - **Templates**: Start with SOP templates and customize them to fit your needs.
     - **Cloud-Based**: Confluence is hosted, offering secure storage and accessibility from anywhere.

### **6. MediaWiki**
   - **Why It Fits**: If you are interested in creating a full-on wiki that looks like **Wikipedia**, **MediaWiki** is a great option.
   - **Features**:
     - **Wiki System**: Designed to create a comprehensive wiki with interlinked pages.
     - **Hosted Solution**: Use cloud hosting services like **DigitalOcean** or **AWS** to host your own private MediaWiki.
     - **Customization**: Offers powerful tools and extensions to make the wiki your own, perfect for housing both SOPs and knowledge outputs.
   - **Hosting**: Requires more setup, but with the flexibility of customization, it can be a great knowledge repository.

### **7. Joplin + Cloud Sync**
   - **Why It Fits**: **Joplin** is an open-source, markdown-based note-taking app that supports cloud syncing.
   - **Features**:
     - **Organized Notebooks**: You can use Joplin to create distinct notebooks for SOPs, backups, and LLM outputs.
     - **Synchronization**: Sync with **NextCloud**, **OneDrive**, or **Dropbox** for accessibility.
     - **Tagging and Search**: Easily tag SOPs and LLM outputs for quick retrieval.

### **8. Coda.io**
   - **Why It Fits**: **Coda** allows you to create documents that are a mix between a **spreadsheet**, **wiki**, and **database**.
   - **Features**:
     - **Structured SOPs**: Create structured documents with embedded databases for your SOPs.
     - **Link LLM Outputs**: Use a **table** or **database view** to link your LLM outputs and add notes or categorization.
     - **All-in-One Tool**: Combines document creation, database, and knowledge management in a single cloud-hosted platform.

### **Summary Recommendation**
For a cohesive approach that allows you to **store SOPs, LLM outputs, and create a knowledge base**, I recommend trying **Notion** or **Obsidian** with cloud sync. Both options offer a high degree of flexibility, are user-friendly, and will let you integrate multiple types of information (SOPs, LLM content, project notes) into a single, interconnected space that functions like a wiki.

Let me know if any of these options resonate with you, or if you'd like more details on how to implement any of these systems!
