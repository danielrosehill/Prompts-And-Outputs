# Prompt

I'm currently trying to think of a way to backup my Fedora Workstation computer. In the past, I've put quite a bit of effort into backing up my Linux computers using tools like Clonezilla and rsync. But I'm trying to think of a different approach. 

I try wherever possible to use the cloud for data storage. But I install a lot of programs on my computer in order to test things out. Naturally I sometimes uninstall things. But lately (for example) I've been adding a lot of Python packages via pip as I try out running local LLMs.

When I think about why I care about backup, it comes down to knowing that the amount of inconvenience that would be caused if you system were to go down tends to increase over time commensurate with how many packages and programs you have installed. 

I'm always skeptical of how realistic it is to expect restores to work programatically especially assuming that you're moving to new hardware.

The approach I'm thinking of is something like this:

Rather than attempt to back up files, I back up an incremental list of changes to my system configuration in a way that I could replicate these changes on new hardware.

I would need:

- The list of packages I've installed through DNF (and which I haven't subsequently uninstalled)
- The listof repos I've added on top of what the latest release of Fedora provides
- The list of pip packages I've installed. 
- Which appimages I'm running on my computer 
- Which crontabs I've added and which systemd processes I've created

Can you think of any approach I could take which would create a daily "backup" of this configuration? Its output would be something like a program that I could use for reinstalling the system by applying all the changes I made to my current system. 

I've thought about using ansible but was wondering if there might be a better way to do this. 


# Output

The approach you’re considering—backing up system configuration rather than files—is a solid way to minimize recovery time, especially when moving to new hardware or reinstalling your system. Here’s a way to implement this approach using a combination of shell scripts, cron jobs, and version control (like Git), without necessarily going for a heavy tool like Ansible.

### Steps for Configuration Backup:

1. **Backup DNF Installed Packages:**
   Use DNF to list installed packages and store the output. You could run the following daily:
   ```bash
   sudo dnf list installed > ~/backups/dnf_installed_packages_$(date +%F).txt
   ```
   Later, you could reinstall them with:
   ```bash
   sudo dnf install $(cat dnf_installed_packages.txt)
   ```

2. **Backup Added Repositories:**
   Fedora repos are typically in `/etc/yum.repos.d/`. You could copy this directory:
   ```bash
   cp -r /etc/yum.repos.d/ ~/backups/yum.repos.d_$(date +%F)
   ```
   Alternatively, list just the repos you’ve added manually (filtering out Fedora defaults) and store this in a text file:
   ```bash
   sudo dnf repolist > ~/backups/dnf_repos_$(date +%F).txt
   ```

3. **Backup Python Packages Installed via Pip:**
   Capture a list of installed Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip freeze > ~/backups/pip_packages_$(date +%F).txt
   ```
   To reinstall, you can use:
   ```bash
   pip install -r pip_packages.txt
   ```

4. **Track AppImages:**
   If you’re using AppImages, you can manually track them by listing the directory where they are stored (assuming you store them in a particular folder):
   ```bash
   ls ~/AppImages > ~/backups/appimages_$(date +%F).txt
   ```

5. **Backup Crontabs:**
   Use the following to back up your crontab:
   ```bash
   crontab -l > ~/backups/crontab_$(date +%F).txt
   ```

6. **Backup Systemd Services:**
   List and back up custom systemd services you’ve created:
   ```bash
   systemctl list-unit-files --user > ~/backups/systemd_user_units_$(date +%F).txt
   systemctl list-unit-files --system > ~/backups/systemd_system_units_$(date +%F).txt
   ```

### Automating the Backup

You can use a cron job to run these commands daily and save the output to a `~/backups/` folder. For example:
```bash
0 2 * * * /home/username/scripts/backup_config.sh
```

In the `backup_config.sh` script, you can run the commands mentioned above, archiving them with `tar` if necessary.

### Tracking Configuration Changes

To version control this information and track changes, you could initialize a Git repository inside your `~/backups/` directory:
```bash
cd ~/backups
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Daily backup $(date +%F)"
```
Then set up a cron job to commit changes daily:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Auto-commit $(date +%F)"
```

This method allows you to keep a log of all the incremental changes to your configuration over time.

**Alternative Tools:**  
You could still use Ansible or similar configuration management tools, but for simpler needs, automating these manual steps may offer more flexibility and control.

# Input

That was interesting. But I'd like to address the need for the approach to be incremental. I don't like the idea of creating a new list of my dnf installed packages every time the script runs even if the data generated is tiny. I'd prefer a single list that just gets incrementally updated at every run. Can you think of a way to achieve that?

# Output

You can definitely implement an incremental update to your list by comparing the current state with the previous state and updating the list accordingly. Below is an approach you can take for the incremental backup of DNF packages and other configurations.

### Approach to Incremental Backup of DNF Packages:

1. **Initial Setup**: Create an initial list of installed packages:
   ```bash
   sudo dnf list installed > ~/backups/dnf_installed_packages.txt
   ```

2. **Daily Incremental Update**: On each subsequent run, compare the current list with the saved list and append any new packages to the saved list.

Here’s a script that achieves this:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# File paths
BACKUP_DIR=~/backups
CURRENT_DNF_LIST=$BACKUP_DIR/dnf_installed_packages_current.txt
SAVED_DNF_LIST=$BACKUP_DIR/dnf_installed_packages.txt
TEMP_DIFF=$BACKUP_DIR/dnf_temp_diff.txt

# Generate current list of installed packages
sudo dnf list installed > "$CURRENT_DNF_LIST"

# Compare the saved list with the current list
diff "$SAVED_DNF_LIST" "$CURRENT_DNF_LIST" | grep ">" | awk '{print $2}' > "$TEMP_DIFF"

# Append any new packages to the saved list
if [ -s "$TEMP_DIFF" ]; then
    cat "$TEMP_DIFF" >> "$SAVED_DNF_LIST"
    echo "New packages added:"
    cat "$TEMP_DIFF"
else
    echo "No new packages found."
fi

# Cleanup temp file
rm "$TEMP_DIFF"
```

### Explanation:
- **dnf_installed_packages.txt**: This is your main list of packages.
- **dnf_installed_packages_current.txt**: This file holds the current state of installed packages for comparison.
- **diff**: This command compares the two lists and extracts new packages not previously installed (indicated by `>`).
- **grep and awk**: These commands filter the output of `diff` to get only the new package names.

### Crontab Entry for Daily Execution:
To run this script daily, you can add a cron job:
```bash
0 2 * * * /home/username/scripts/incremental_dnf_backup.sh
```

### Expanding This for Other Configurations:

You can apply the same logic for other components like pip packages, repositories, and systemd services:

1. **Pip Packages Incremental Update**:
   Replace the DNF list generation part with `pip freeze`, compare, and append new entries.

2. **Repositories**:
   Compare the current list of repositories with your saved list and append any new repos using the same approach.

3. **Crontab**:
   To incrementally back up crontab entries, run the following inside a similar script:
   ```bash
   crontab -l > ~/backups/current_crontab.txt
   diff ~/backups/saved_crontab.txt ~/backups/current_crontab.txt | grep ">" | awk '{print $2}' >> ~/backups/saved_crontab.txt
   ```

By structuring it this way, only new configurations are appended to your main lists, keeping the backup process incremental and efficient.
