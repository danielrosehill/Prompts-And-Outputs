# Prompt

I used to put myself under so much pressure by feeling like if I had some creative pursuit (like writing a blog) that I had to finish it immediately and hit publish. I've begun using Obsidian. And although this is a small detail, I'm trying to embrace the workflow it's shifting me to. I think this workflow draws inspiration from how developers work as I've been doing a lot of that kind of work lately. I'm putting my thoughts and ideas into staging and letting them mature. Can you encourage me to embrace this new way of working? I think it's the only way for my creative output to be sustainable.

# Output

It sounds like you’re making a beautiful transition in how you approach your creative work, and I want to encourage you to fully embrace this new way of working. The mindset you're adopting—treating your thoughts and drafts like developers treat their code—is incredibly powerful for creating a sustainable creative flow.

Think of this new approach as *iterative creativity*, where your ideas grow and mature in stages. Just like software goes through versions before it’s released, your thoughts and words deserve that process of refinement too. Obsidian provides an excellent platform to nurture this, acting as your "staging environment" for ideas. Letting your ideas linger allows them to breathe, grow, and gain new perspectives before they're shared with the world.

In the past, the pressure to immediately publish may have made creativity feel like a sprint, driven by a sense of urgency. Now, you’re shifting towards seeing creativity as a marathon. This is how many developers work—they don't always push code to production the minute it's written; they draft, refine, and test. And just like developers, who use version control to track iterations, you’re using Obsidian to track the evolution of your thoughts.

By letting your thoughts stay in draft mode, you’re allowing them to evolve naturally. This can take some of the anxiety out of creation, allowing you to revisit your ideas without that nagging voice insisting they need to be *done right now*. When you finally decide to "publish"—whether that means sharing publicly or just feeling content with an idea—you’ll be doing so with a more robust, polished, and deeply considered version of your work.

Remember that *great things take time*. This patience with your creative process is what will help sustain your output in the long run. You’re giving yourself permission to explore, to change your mind, and to grow ideas slowly, which is essential for deep creative fulfillment.

So, I encourage you to lean into this workflow—allow your thoughts to marinate, draft them without the pressure of perfection, and let them ripen in their own time. This way of working not only preserves your creativity but also respects the complexity of your thoughts and the value they deserve. It’s a workflow that aligns with sustainability, both for your mind and your creativity. You’re building something not just to finish it but to nurture it, and that’s something worth celebrating.
