# Prompt

The main reason I don't want to self host is because I like to keep backups of my own data. So perhaps you can suggest some SaaS tools that would satisfy this requirement. I like to use b2 for backups. I'm comfortable with SaaS tools so long as they allow me to do that. Say my budget is about $100/month. I'm focused on finding the most powerful and versatile tool for my needs. An Ai integration would be great too.

# Output

Based on your requirements for a powerful, versatile SaaS tool with backup capabilities, AI integration, and a budget of around $100/month, I'd recommend considering the following options:

## Zoho One

Zoho One is a comprehensive suite of business applications that could meet your needs while allowing for backups to Backblaze B2.

**Pros:**
- Comprehensive solution for various business needs

Zoho One integrates with Backblaze B2 through Zoho Backup, allowing you to create backups of your Zoho data to B2[5].

**Pricing:** Starts at $37/user/month (billed annually) for all applications, which should fit within your $100/month budget for a small team.

## HubSpot

- Regular updates and new feature releases

**Cons:**

- Can become expensive as you add more tools and contacts

While HubSpot doesn't have a direct integration with Backblaze B2, you can use third-party tools like Zapier to create automated backups to B2.

**Pricing:** The Starter CRM Suite starts at $50/month for 2 users, which could fit your budget depending on your team size.

## Salesforce Essentials

Salesforce Essentials is a scaled-down version of the enterprise Salesforce platform, designed for small businesses.

**Key Features:**
- Powerful CRM capabilities

**Pros:**

Salesforce can be backed up to Backblaze B2 using third-party tools like OwnBackup or Spanning[4].

**Pricing:** Starts at $25/user/month, which could fit within your budget for a small team.

## Conclusion

Among these options, Zoho One stands out as the most comprehensive and versatile solution that fits your requirements. It offers a wide range of applications, AI integration through Zia, and direct integration with Backblaze B2 for backups. Its pricing is also competitive for the features offered.

However, the final choice depends on your specific business needs. If you're more focused on CRM and marketing, HubSpot or Salesforce Essentials might be better fits. Remember to factor in the potential costs of any additional tools or integrations you might need for backups to B2 if they're not natively supported.

Regardless of which solution you choose, I recommend taking advantage of free trials to test the software and ensure it meets your specific needs before committing.
