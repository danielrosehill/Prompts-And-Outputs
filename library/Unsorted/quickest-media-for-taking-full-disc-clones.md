To summarize: you're asking about the fastest possible setup for writing full disk clones of your Fedora system and whether **USB 3** can match **SATA** performance, as well as if you can run a **SATA cable** directly off the motherboard for cloning.

### USB 3 vs. SATA Performance:
- **USB 3.0** (also known as USB 3.2 Gen 1) has a **maximum theoretical speed of 5 Gbps** (~625 MB/s), while **USB 3.1 Gen 2** or **USB 3.2 Gen 2** can reach **10 Gbps** (~1.25 GB/s).
- **SATA III** has a **maximum speed of 6 Gbps** (~750 MB/s).

### Comparison:
- **USB 3.0 (5 Gbps)** is generally **slower than SATA III (6 Gbps)** for large, sustained transfers (like disk cloning).
- **USB 3.1/3.2 Gen 2 (10 Gbps)** can match or exceed SATA III speeds in some cases, provided both the **USB controller** and **USB drive/enclosure** support it.

### Best Setup for Fast Disk Cloning:
For the **fastest write speed** when taking full disk clones, **SATA** is typically faster and more reliable, especially for **internal connections**.

### Recommendations for Optimal Setup:

#### 1. **Internal SATA Connection (Fastest)**
   - **Direct SATA Connection**: You can connect a target disk directly to the **SATA ports on your motherboard**. This is usually the fastest option for cloning since the drive is directly connected via SATA.
   - **SATA Hot-Swap Bays**: You can install a **SATA hot-swap bay** or a **SATA-to-eSATA bracket** in your system. These allow you to quickly connect and disconnect SATA drives externally while keeping the performance of an internal SATA connection.
     - **SATA-to-eSATA Adapter**: If you want to bring a SATA connection to the outside of your case, use a **SATA-to-eSATA adapter** connected to a motherboard SATA port.
     - **SATA Docking Station**: Another option is a **SATA docking station** that connects via eSATA or USB 3.1 Gen 2. It allows quick swapping of drives while maintaining high-speed connections.
   - **NVMe Cloning**: If your system supports **NVMe drives**, consider using an NVMe SSD for cloning, as these can offer much higher speeds (up to 3500 MB/s). SATA will still be the bottleneck if you use a SATA SSD or HDD, but cloning to NVMe internally offers maximum speed.

#### 2. **USB 3.1/3.2 Gen 2 (Second Fastest)**
   - **USB 3.1 Gen 2 or USB 3.2 Gen 2** can reach **up to 10 Gbps**, which makes it a viable option if using an external SSD or HDD that supports this speed. However, the performance may be bottlenecked by the speed of the drive itself.
   - For high-speed cloning, ensure that both your external drive and the enclosure/cable support **USB 3.1 Gen 2 (10 Gbps)**. Many cheaper enclosures may cap out at USB 3.0 speeds (5 Gbps).

#### 3. **Direct SATA Connection with SATA Cables**
   - You can indeed run a **SATA cable** directly from your motherboard to an internal/external SATA drive for fast cloning. If you're planning to do frequent backups, you might consider adding a **hot-swappable drive bay** to easily swap target drives.
     - **How to Set Up a SATA-to-eSATA Bracket**:
       1. Install a **SATA-to-eSATA bracket** into your computerâ€™s PCI slot. The SATA cable connects to a SATA port on your motherboard.
       2. Use **eSATA** to connect to an external drive. This gives you near-native SATA III performance without opening your case each time.
   
#### 4. **Cloning Tools**
   - **Clonezilla**: A highly efficient and fast cloning tool that supports direct SATA connections and USB drives.
     - You can use Clonezilla to create and restore full disk images quickly, especially when using a SATA-connected drive.
   - **dd**: A native Linux tool for disk cloning.
     - For efficient cloning, use:
       ```bash
       sudo dd if=/dev/sdX of=/dev/sdY bs=64M status=progress
       ```
       where `/dev/sdX` is your source drive and `/dev/sdY` is the target.

### Conclusion:
- **Internal SATA connections** will generally give you the fastest speeds for disk cloning. If you want the highest performance, consider connecting the target drive directly to a **SATA III port** on your motherboard or using an **eSATA external connection**.
- **USB 3.1/3.2 Gen 2** is a viable alternative, but make sure the external enclosure and target drive support those speeds.
