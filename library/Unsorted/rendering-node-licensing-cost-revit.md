To set up a **dedicated rendering node** for **Revit** on your LAN, you would typically need to license the rendering software associated with Revit or use third-party options, such as **V-Ray** or Autodesk’s **cloud rendering services**. Here are a couple of options to consider:

### **1. V-Ray for Revit**:
If you're using **V-Ray** for rendering, you’ll need to purchase **V-Ray Render Node licenses** for each machine that will participate in the rendering process. The cost of a **V-Ray Render Node** is approximately **$167 per year**. These licenses are necessary for each machine that contributes to distributed rendering, including the main workstation initiating the job【174†source】【172†source】.

### **2. Autodesk Rendering (Cloud Credits)**:
Autodesk also offers **cloud-based rendering** through the Autodesk Rendering service. This requires **cloud credits** for rendering tasks, depending on the complexity and resolution of the render. A subscription to Revit includes some cloud rendering capabilities, but additional usage is billed via **Flex Tokens** or **Cloud Credits**. Local rendering with Revit itself doesn’t require additional licenses unless you're using specific plugins【175†source】【176†source】.

### **Hardware Recommendations**:
For a **dedicated rendering node**, it’s recommended to have:
- A **multi-core CPU** (more cores will significantly reduce rendering time).
- A **high-performance GPU** if using GPU-accelerated rendering tools like V-Ray.
- Ample **RAM** (32 GB or more) for handling complex models and scenes.
- **SSD storage** for faster data access and processing.
