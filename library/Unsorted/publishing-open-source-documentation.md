Let's say that I want to begin sharing lots of open source documentation. Github is primarily intended for publishing code. Are there other platforms that might be more suitable for this purpose? I'd need the tool to be free. And it would be idea to be able to publish via Github regardless

# Output

Here are some free platforms suitable for sharing open-source documentation while allowing publishing via GitHub:

1. **Read the Docs**: Integrates with GitHub, supports versioning, and is ideal for Sphinx documentation.

2. **GitBook**: Offers a collaborative environment for Markdown-based documentation, with free tier options.

3. **MkDocs**: A static site generator that builds documentation from Markdown files, suitable for project documentation.

4. **Docusaurus**: Free and open-source, focused on building documentation websites, and integrates with GitHub.

These platforms provide dedicated documentation features alongside GitHub integration.
