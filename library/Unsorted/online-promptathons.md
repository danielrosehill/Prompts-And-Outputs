# Prompt

Great. Now let's move on to thinking about the collaborative prompathon idea. I'm going to assume that it would be online because it's going to be hard to gather up enough people interested in this locally. Can you suggest some online platforms where this might be convened and organised? How might users go about collaborating and sharing outputs and prompts in real time while having something like video chat going too?

# Output

Organizing an online collaborative "promptathon" involves choosing the right platforms that can facilitate real-time collaboration, sharing of prompts and outputs, and possibly integrating video chat. Here are some platforms and tools you might consider:

### 1. **Online Platforms for Convening and Organizing**

#### **1.1. Discord**
   - **Features**: Discord offers text channels, voice channels, and video chat, making it a versatile platform for real-time collaboration. Participants can share prompts and outputs in dedicated text channels while discussing ideas over voice or video chat.
   - **Collaboration**: You can create separate channels for different teams or focus areas, and use bots for organizing tasks and sharing files.

#### **1.2. Slack**
   - **Features**: Slack is another excellent platform for real-time communication, with support for text messaging, file sharing, and integration with various tools like Google Drive, Airtable, and Trello. Slack's Huddles feature allows for quick voice chats, and you can start a video call directly from any channel.
   - **Collaboration**: Create channels for different topics or teams. You can also use Slack's integration with collaborative tools to share documents and outputs seamlessly.

#### **1.3. Microsoft Teams**
   - **Features**: Microsoft Teams offers robust collaboration features, including chat, file sharing, and video conferencing. It also integrates well with Office 365, allowing for real-time collaboration on documents.
   - **Collaboration**: Teams channels can be set up for different aspects of the promptathon, with simultaneous video chat and document sharing.

#### **1.4. Zoom**
   - **Features**: Zoom is a leading video conferencing platform that can host large groups. It allows for screen sharing, breakout rooms, and chat, making it suitable for group discussions and focused work sessions.
   - **Collaboration**: Participants can use shared documents (like Google Docs) or whiteboards (like Miro) alongside the video chat. Breakout rooms can be used for team-based activities.

### 2. **Tools for Real-Time Collaboration and Sharing**

#### **2.1. Google Workspace**
   - **Features**: Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides allow for real-time collaboration, where multiple users can edit and comment on documents simultaneously. Google Drive provides a central repository for sharing files.
   - **Collaboration**: Share a Google Doc with all participants to collaboratively work on prompts, and use Google Meet for video conferencing.

#### **2.2. Notion**
   - **Features**: Notion is a highly flexible tool for creating shared workspaces. It allows users to build databases, track tasks, and collaborate on documents in real time. You can embed video calls from Zoom or other platforms directly into Notion pages.
   - **Collaboration**: Use Notion to create a central hub for the promptathon, where participants can share prompts, track progress, and communicate.

#### **2.3. Airtable**
   - **Features**: Airtable combines the features of a spreadsheet and a database, making it ideal for tracking prompts, results, and tasks. You can link Airtable with Slack or Discord for seamless updates.
   - **Collaboration**: Set up an Airtable base to manage the promptathon, and integrate it with your chosen communication platform.

#### **2.4. Miro**
   - **Features**: Miro is an online whiteboard platform that allows for real-time collaboration on brainstorming, mind mapping, and planning. It supports integrations with tools like Slack, Zoom, and Google Workspace.
   - **Collaboration**: Use Miro for group brainstorming sessions and share the board with all participants for a visual way of organizing thoughts and prompts.

### 3. **Integrating Video Chat with Collaboration**

#### **3.1. Zoom + Google Docs/Notion**
   - **Setup**: Use Zoom for video chat and screen sharing, and Google Docs or Notion for real-time collaboration on prompts and outputs. Zoom’s breakout rooms can be used for team-based work, with each team working on a shared document.

#### **3.2. Discord + Miro/Airtable**
   - **Setup**: Discord can be the main communication platform, with voice/video channels for discussion. Use Miro for collaborative brainstorming and Airtable for tracking tasks and progress. Links to documents can be shared in Discord channels.

#### **3.3. Microsoft Teams + Office 365**
   - **Setup**: Use Microsoft Teams for video chat and collaboration, and leverage Office 365 for real-time document editing. Teams’ integration with OneNote or Planner can help keep the promptathon organized.

### 4. **Managing the Promptathon**

   - **Facilitators**: Have facilitators to guide the sessions, keep time, and ensure participants stay on track.
   - **Shared Workspace**: Create a shared online workspace (e.g., Notion, Google Drive) where all participants can access resources, documents, and session schedules.
   - **Documentation**: Encourage participants to document their prompts and outcomes in a structured way, using shared templates or forms.
   - **Feedback Loops**: Set up regular intervals for teams to share their progress with the larger group, fostering cross-pollination of ideas.

By combining the right communication platform with real-time collaboration tools, you can create a structured and dynamic environment for your collaborative promptathon, enabling participants to ideate, iterate, and share insights effectively.## Extracted Prompts
