# Prompt

I'm learning a lot from you, ChatGPT! Let's take this as an example. Let's say that I want to come up with a way to periodically refresh on key things like the API methods. I've never been a fan of flashcards. But it might be useful to mark up specific outputs for periodic review. I use Obsidian. Are there tools that can support this kind of workflow which you can think of? (Spaced repetition)?

# Output

I'm glad to hear you're learning a lot! Since you use **Obsidian** and you're looking for a way to periodically refresh key concepts like **API methods** without relying on traditional flashcards, you can absolutely set up a **spaced repetition system** (SRS) within Obsidian. Spaced repetition is a proven method for reinforcing learning by revisiting information at increasing intervals, and several tools can help you integrate this directly into your workflow.

### Tools to Support Spaced Repetition in Obsidian

1. **Obsidian Plugin: Obsidian Spaced Repetition**
   - **What it does**: This plugin brings spaced repetition into Obsidian by allowing you to create notes with questions and answers that are reviewed on a spaced repetition schedule. It's similar to flashcards but fully integrated into your Obsidian environment, meaning you can mark up specific outputs or parts of your notes for periodic review.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Supports **inline cloze deletions** (like filling in the blank).
     - You can embed **question/answer** sections in your regular notes, which will show up for review.
     - You can adjust **intervals** and **due dates** to customize the learning process.
   - **How to use it**:
     1. Install the **Obsidian Spaced Repetition** plugin from the community plugins.
     2. Use the `::` syntax to define questions and answers, or mark up sections you want to review periodically.
     3. Set up the plugin’s settings to control the frequency of review.
   - **Example**:
     ```markdown
     What does the GET method do?::Fetches data from the server.
     ```

2. **Obsidian Plugin: Obsidian Reminder**
   - **What it does**: The **Reminder** plugin can be used to remind you of specific tasks or notes that you’ve marked for periodic review. While it's not a full-fledged spaced repetition tool, you can use it to set up reminders to review certain notes (like API methods) at specific intervals.
   - **How to use it**:
     - You can set reminders in any note and link them to specific sections.
     - Use this for recurring reminders about reviewing key concepts.
   - **Example**:
     You can tag a note like `#review-api-methods` and set a reminder in the note to review it every week.

3. **Obsidian Plugin: Obsidian Anki**
   - **What it does**: If you're interested in **Anki**'s spaced repetition algorithm but want to work inside Obsidian, this plugin allows you to export notes from Obsidian to **Anki**. Anki is one of the most popular spaced repetition apps, and this plugin bridges the gap between your markdown notes and Anki's robust SRS features.
   - **How to use it**:
     - You can create questions and answers in Obsidian, and the plugin will automatically sync them to Anki decks.
     - This allows you to review using Anki’s app while still creating your notes in Obsidian.

4. **Using Tags and Queries for Manual Spaced Review**
   - **What it does**: You can create a manual review system using Obsidian’s **tagging** and **query** features. For example, you can tag key sections of your notes that you want to review, and then use a search query to surface them periodically.
   - **How to use it**:
     - Tag notes or sections you want to review with `#review` or `#spaced-repetition`.
     - Create a dashboard note with embedded queries to surface these tags and review them regularly.
   - **Example**:
     Tag a section like this:
     ```markdown
     ## API Methods Overview
     - **GET**: Fetches data from the server. #review
     - **POST**: Sends data to the server. #review
     ```
     Then create a note with a query to show all `#review` items:
     ```markdown
     ```query
     tag:#review
     ```

5. **Using Daily Notes for Tracking Review Tasks**
   - **What it does**: If you prefer a more manual system for spaced repetition, you can use Obsidian’s **Daily Notes** feature to create recurring review tasks. For example, you can set up reminders in your daily notes to review specific sections of your knowledge base.
   - **How to use it**:
     - Add a section in your daily notes template that lists items for review.
     - Each day, you can decide which items to review and mark them off.
   - **Example**:
     In your daily note:
     ```markdown
     ## Today’s Reviews
     - [ ] Review API Methods
     - [ ] Refresh understanding of PATCH vs PUT
     ```

### Setting Up Spaced Repetition Workflow in Obsidian

1. **Install the Obsidian Spaced Repetition Plugin**:
   - Go to **Settings** → **Community Plugins** → Search for "Spaced Repetition" and install it.
   - Configure the plugin settings to your liking (e.g., review intervals, how many cards per day).

2. **Mark Up Key Sections for Review**:
   - Use the `::` syntax to define questions and answers, or highlight key sections with tags like `#review`.

3. **Use the Plugin’s Review Dashboard**:
   - The plugin will generate a list of items that are due for review based on your configured intervals.
   - This list can be accessed directly within Obsidian, so you don't need to leave your notes to review important topics.

4. **Combine with Daily Notes or Tags**:
   - For an additional layer of review, use **tags** or **queries** in daily notes to surface items that you want to review at regular intervals.

### Benefits of This Workflow:
- **Embedded in Your Notes**: You don’t have to leave Obsidian or use a separate tool for review.
- **Customizable**: You control the review intervals and which notes/sections need to be reviewed.
- **Works with Your Existing Knowledge Base**: No need to convert your notes into flashcards; just mark them for review.

By using these tools, you can set up a lightweight **spaced repetition** system directly within Obsidian, making it easier to periodically review key concepts like API methods without relying on traditional flashcards.
