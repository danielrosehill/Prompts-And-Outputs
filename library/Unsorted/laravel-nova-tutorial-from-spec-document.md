# Prompt


Could you provide me with a how to manual for setting up this project using Laravel Nova? I already have a Postgres database but other than that I'll be starting from scratch. Be as detailed as possible. Go step by step through the entire process.

# Output

Certainly! I'll provide you with a detailed, step-by-step guide on setting up the Output Hub project using Laravel Nova and your existing PostgreSQL database. Let's get started:

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- PHP 8.1 or higher
- Composer
- Node.js and npm
- PostgreSQL (which you already have)

## Step 1: Create a New Laravel Project

1. Open your terminal and navigate to your desired project directory.
2. Run the following command to create a new Laravel project:

```bash
composer create-project laravel/laravel output-hub
```

3. Change into the project directory:

```bash
cd output-hub
```

## Step 2: Configure the Database

1. Open the `.env` file in your project root and update the database configuration:

```
DB_CONNECTION=pgsql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=5432
DB_DATABASE=your_database_name
DB_USERNAME=your_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
```

2. Replace `your_database_name`, `your_username`, and `your_password` with your PostgreSQL credentials.

## Step 3: Install Laravel Nova

1. Add your Nova credentials to the `auth.json` file in your project root:

```bash
composer config http-basic.nova.laravel.com your@email.com your-nova-license-key
```

2. Require Nova in your project:

```bash
composer require laravel/nova
```

3. Publish Nova's assets:

```bash
php artisan nova:install
php artisan migrate
```

## Step 4: Set Up Authentication

1. Install Laravel Breeze for authentication scaffolding:

```bash
composer require laravel/breeze --dev
php artisan breeze:install
```

2. Install and compile your assets:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Step 5: Create Database Migrations

Create migrations for the required tables:

```bash
php artisan make:migration create_prompts_table
php artisan make:migration create_outputs_table
php artisan make:migration create_agents_table
php artisan make:migration create_tags_table
php artisan make:migration create_taggables_table
```

Edit each migration file to define the table structure. Here's an example for the `prompts` table:

```php
public function up()
{
    Schema::create('prompts', function (Blueprint $table) {
        $table->id();
        $table->string('title');
        $table->text('content');
        $table->foreignId('user_id')->constrained();
        $table->timestamps();
    });
}
```

Create similar structures for other tables, then run the migrations:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

## Step 6: Create Models

Create Eloquent models for each table:

```bash
php artisan make:model Prompt
php artisan make:model Output
php artisan make:model Agent
php artisan make:model Tag
```

Edit each model to define relationships and any necessary attributes.

## Step 7: Create Nova Resources

Create Nova resources for each model:

```bash
php artisan nova:resource Prompt
php artisan nova:resource Output
php artisan nova:resource Agent
php artisan nova:resource Tag
```

Edit each resource file in the `app/Nova` directory to define fields and relationships.

## Step 8: Implement OpenAI Integration

1. Install the OpenAI PHP client:

```bash
composer require openai-php/client
```

2. Create an OpenAI service:

```bash
php artisan make:service OpenAIService
```

3. Implement the OpenAI API calls in this service.

## Step 9: Create Custom Nova Tools

For custom functionality like generating outputs:

```bash
php artisan nova:tool OutputGenerator
```

Implement the tool's logic in the created files.

## Step 10: Set Up Authorization

1. Install Laravel Permission package:

```bash
composer require spatie/laravel-permission
```

2. Publish the package's migration:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Spatie\Permission\PermissionServiceProvider"
```

3. Run the migration:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

4. Implement roles and permissions in your `NovaServiceProvider.php`:

```php
use Laravel\Nova\Nova;

Nova::auth(function ($request) {
    return $request->user()->hasPermissionTo('access-nova');
});
```

## Step 11: Implement Tagging System

1. Create a `Taggable` trait to be used by models that can be tagged.
2. Implement the tagging logic in your Nova resources.

## Step 12: Set Up User Settings

1. Create a `UserSettings` model and migration:

```bash
php artisan make:model UserSettings -m
```

2. Implement the settings logic in your Nova `User` resource.

## Step 13: Implement Search and Filtering

Use Nova's built-in search and filter capabilities in your resources:

```php
public function fields(Request $request)
{
    return [
        ID::make()->sortable(),
        Text::make('Title')->sortable()->searchable(),
        // ... other fields
    ];
}

public function filters(Request $request)
{
    return [
        new Filters\YourCustomFilter,
    ];
}
```

## Step 14: Set Up API Endpoints

1. Create API controllers for each resource:

```bash
php artisan make:controller Api/PromptController --api
```

2. Define routes in `routes/api.php`.
3. Implement CRUD operations in each controller.

## Step 15: Implement Frontend

1. Set up a Vue.js frontend in your Laravel project.
2. Create components for each main screen (Prompt Management, Output Management, etc.).
3. Implement API calls to your backend.

## Step 16: Security Measures

1. Implement API authentication using Laravel Sanctum.
2. Set up CORS configuration.
3. Implement input validation and sanitization.

## Step 17: Testing

1. Write feature tests for your API endpoints:

```bash
php artisan make:test PromptApiTest
```

2. Write unit tests for your services and models.

## Step 18: Documentation

1. Generate API documentation using a tool like Scribe:

```bash
composer require knuckleswtf/scribe
php artisan scribe:generate
```

2. Write user documentation for the application.

## Step 19: Deployment Preparation

1. Set up environment-specific configuration files.
2. Configure your web server (e.g., Nginx) for the application.
3. Set up a deployment pipeline using a tool like Laravel Forge or GitHub Actions.

## Step 20: Launch

1. Deploy your application to a staging environment.
2. Conduct thorough testing.
3. Once satisfied, deploy to production.

This guide provides a comprehensive overview of setting up the Output Hub project using Laravel Nova. Remember to consult the official Laravel and Nova documentation for more detailed information on specific features and best practices[1][2][4]. Always prioritize security in your implementation, especially when dealing with sensitive data like API keys[3][5].
