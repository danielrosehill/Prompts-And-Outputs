# Prompt

I'd like to set up something like a unified environment where I can get notifications and monitor the statuses of all my technical infrastructure from one place.
currently i have: one proxmox host and 2 x VMs
A few cloud servers
Can you think of any platforms that might provide observability across my network?

# Output

For monitoring and receiving notifications across your **Proxmox host**, **VMs**, and **cloud servers**, several platforms provide centralized observability. These platforms offer integrated dashboards, alerting, and monitoring capabilities for system health, network performance, and infrastructure metrics. Here are a few solutions that might suit your needs:

### 1. **Prometheus + Grafana**
   - **Overview**: Prometheus is an open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit, which excels at collecting and querying time-series data. **Grafana** works alongside Prometheus to provide rich visualization of the collected data.
   - **How it helps**: You can set up **Prometheus** on your Proxmox host and VMs to monitor system metrics (CPU, RAM, disk, network usage) and export them to **Grafana** for a unified dashboard. Additionally, Grafana supports many integrations, so you can include your cloud servers.
   - **Alerting**: Prometheus includes an alerting mechanism called **Alertmanager**, which integrates with **Slack**, **email**, or other systems to send alerts based on defined thresholds.
   - **Recommended For**: Tech-savvy users who want full control over their monitoring setup, with robust alerting and custom dashboards.

### 2. **Zabbix**
   - **Overview**: **Zabbix** is an open-source enterprise-level monitoring platform that can monitor not only servers (Proxmox, VMs, cloud instances) but also network devices, databases, and services.
   - **How it helps**: Zabbix can be used to monitor the health of your **Proxmox host**, **VMs**, and **cloud servers** with a single dashboard. It supports **SNMP**, **JMX**, and **agent-based monitoring**.
   - **Alerting**: Zabbix has built-in alerting, and notifications can be sent via **email**, **SMS**, **Slack**, or other channels when specific triggers are activated.
   - **Recommended For**: Users looking for a comprehensive, out-of-the-box solution for monitoring a wide range of devices and services.

### 3. **Datadog**
   - **Overview**: **Datadog** is a cloud-based infrastructure monitoring platform that supports unified observability for on-premise hosts, VMs, and cloud instances. It offers out-of-the-box integrations with various services and provides deep metrics, logs, and trace analysis.
   - **How it helps**: You can monitor your **Proxmox host** and VMs by installing Datadog's agent on the system. It integrates easily with cloud services like AWS, GCP, and DigitalOcean to provide a centralized monitoring platform.
   - **Alerting**: Datadog provides highly customizable alerting via **email**, **Slack**, **PagerDuty**, and more. It can also notify you when specific thresholds are met or exceeded.
   - **Recommended For**: Users seeking a managed service with minimal setup and support for cloud services.
