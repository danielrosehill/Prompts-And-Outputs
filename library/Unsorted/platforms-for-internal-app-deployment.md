Yes, there are several platforms specifically designed for creating and deploying private Android apps for internal tools. These platforms typically focus on enterprise-level needs, allowing businesses to create, manage, and distribute apps internally without going through public app stores like Google Play.

### 1. **Google Play Managed Google Play (Private Apps)**

\- **Google Play Managed Google Play** allows businesses to distribute private apps only to their organization. The apps are accessible through the Managed Google Play Store, which is managed via an enterprise mobility management (EMM) solution like **Google Workspace**, **Microsoft Intune**, or **VMware Workspace ONE**.

\- This option is ideal for organizations already using Android devices with enterprise management.

### 2. **Firebase App Distribution**

\- **Firebase App Distribution** is part of Google’s Firebase suite, offering an easy way to distribute pre-release apps to testers and team members.

\- It’s well-suited for internal tools and apps under development, providing detailed feedback, version control, and crash reporting.

### 3. **Microsoft Intune**

\- **Microsoft Intune** is a cloud-based service that focuses on mobile device management (MDM) and mobile application management (MAM).

\- It allows organizations to securely distribute internal Android apps directly to employee devices. It also provides features for app management, security, and compliance.

### 4. **VMware Workspace ONE**

\- **VMware Workspace ONE** provides a unified endpoint management solution, including private app distribution for Android.

\- It supports deployment, management, and security for internal apps and integrates with existing enterprise environments.

### 5. [**Appery.io**](http://Appery.io)

\- [**Appery.io**](http://Appery.io) is a low-code development platform that enables businesses to create and deploy private mobile apps for internal use.

\- It provides tools for building Android apps with a focus on internal tools and workflows, offering cloud-based management and distribution.

### 6. **AppSheet**

\- Apps created with Power Apps can be distributed privately to employees and integrated with Microsoft’s ecosystem.

### 9. **Internal Distribution via APKs**

\- For smaller organizations or teams, distributing APK files directly to employees or team members is a straightforward way to deploy internal Android apps.

\- This method can be managed via email, internal portals, or shared cloud storage, but it lacks the management and security features of the above platforms.

### 10. **Appaloosa**

\- **Appaloosa** is an enterprise app store platform that allows businesses to distribute and manage internal apps for Android.
