# Prompt

My desk is currently supported by trestles which I purchased in IKEA. Are these typically a standard height?

# Output

Yes, trestles from IKEA and similar retailers typically come in standard heights. The most common height for trestles is around 70-75 cm (approximately 27.5-29.5 inches), which is a standard desk height suitable for most people to use while seated.

Some models of trestles are adjustable, allowing for variations in height. However, most fixed trestles will fall within this typical range, making them compatible with standard desktop surfaces.

If you'd like to know the exact height of your trestles, I can look up specific IKEA models for their dimensions if you recall the model name!
