Are there any standardised systems used for grouping world countries into groups according to their geopolitical allegiance?

# Output

There is no single, universally standardized system for grouping countries based on **geopolitical allegiance**, as these groupings can be highly fluid, context-dependent, and subject to change based on shifting alliances, economic ties, and strategic interests. However, certain **frameworks, alliances, and organizations** have emerged over time to classify countries based on their **geopolitical alignment** or **membership in specific political or economic blocs**. These frameworks can help analysts and governments assess the global landscape.

### Conclusion:

There is no single, formal system for categorizing countries purely by **geopolitical allegiance**, but intelligence agencies, governments, and international organizations use various groupings based on **military alliances**, **economic unions**, **regional blocs**, and **ideological or religious affiliations**. Some of the most widely recognized frameworks include **NATO**, **BRICS**, **G7/G20**, **OECD**, **OIC**, and **UN regional groups**. These frameworks provide standardized methods for understanding global alignments but are always subject to change due to the dynamic nature of international relations.
