# Input

Thanks for the self hosted aggregators. But it seems like a pain to have to maintain two tools: one just for RSS gathering and the other for building dashboards. Perhaps you can think of one tool which can be self hosted and which could do both (maintain RSS subs and build dashboards)?

# Output

I understand—it would be much more convenient to have a **single tool** that allows you to self-host and **manage RSS feeds while also providing a dashboard** with visualizations and analytics. Here are some **integrated solutions** that can accomplish both tasks:

### **1. Matomo**
- **Overview**: **Matomo** is an open-source web analytics platform that is usually used for tracking website activity, but it has the flexibility to be adapted for RSS aggregation. By setting up a custom implementation, you can collect RSS feed data and display it in a visual dashboard.
- **Features**:
  - Allows for **custom data ingestion**, which means you can configure it to collect RSS data.
  - Includes **visual dashboards** that you can customize, offering flexibility similar to Google Analytics.
  - You can extend it with plugins, making it adaptable for RSS aggregation.
- **Strengths**: Matomo offers a **powerful visualization dashboard**, and once set up, it allows you to maintain an integrated platform for RSS aggregation and analysis.
- **Cons**: Setting up RSS feed ingestion requires some customization effort.

### **2. Wallabag with Grafana**

  - Wallabag can be configured to **fetch RSS feeds**, aggregate content, and store it in a centralized database.
  - **Grafana** can then be used to create a **custom dashboard** for monitoring content metrics like publishing frequency, sentiment, or keyword trends.
- **Strengths**: You can combine **RSS collection and visualization** using Wallabag and Grafana. The integration is relatively straightforward since Wallabag stores all content in a database that Grafana can connect to.
- **Cons**: Requires setting up two tools, but they integrate well enough to function like a single solution.

### **3. Miniflux + Custom Dashboard Extension**
- **Overview**: **Miniflux** is a simple, open-source RSS aggregator that has a clean API, which makes it possible to extend its capabilities to include dashboard visualizations.
- **Features**:
  - **Miniflux** is lightweight and focuses on efficient RSS aggregation with a straightforward interface.
  - You can extend Miniflux with a **custom dashboard** by building a simple web app using frameworks like **Flask** (Python) or **Node.js**, leveraging Miniflux's API to gather data and display it visually in charts or graphs.
- **Strengths**: You keep everything **self-hosted** and have full control over data collection and display. Miniflux's **API** allows you to automate data aggregation and develop a dashboard without needing a second complete product.
- **Cons**: Requires some coding to create the visualization, but if you have the capability, it becomes a very powerful and efficient solution.

### **4. Wazuh**
- **Overview**: **Wazuh** is an open-source security platform, primarily intended for security analytics and monitoring. However, it has a powerful **dashboard system** (via **Kibana** integration) that can be repurposed for different data aggregation, including RSS feeds.
- **Features**:
  - **Kibana** is used as the front end, so you can visualize aggregated RSS data in a **custom dashboard**.
  - Wazuh can be adapted to receive **RSS feeds** using its data ingestion system, and the entire setup can be hosted on your infrastructure.
- **Strengths**: Offers an integrated visualization platform with **Kibana** and has a lot of customizability in terms of setting up dashboards.

### **5. All-in-One with Huginn**
- **Overview**: **Huginn** is an open-source tool that allows you to create agents that perform automated tasks, much like a personal "IFTTT" or "Zapier." Huginn can be configured to **fetch RSS feeds**, filter them, and trigger visualizations.
- **Features**:
  - Huginn has **agents** that can subscribe to RSS feeds and **filter content** based on keywords or other parameters.
  - Data can be displayed using simple visualization tools integrated with Huginn, or by sending the processed data to a **custom dashboard** via another plugin.
  - Huginn is highly customizable, meaning you can create an integrated solution for gathering, filtering, and visualizing data—all within one platform.

- **Cons**: The initial setup and learning curve can be steep, but it is flexible enough to serve as an all-in-one solution.

### **6. Splunk (Free for Small Scale)**
- **Overview**: **Splunk** can aggregate data from multiple sources and has strong dashboard capabilities. Although it is generally costly, Splunk offers a **free version** with **limited data usage** that may be sufficient for personal use.
- **Features**:
  - Splunk is capable of ingesting **RSS feed data** (using custom scripts or integration tools) and creating **real-time visual dashboards**.
  - The **visualization and alerting capabilities** are quite robust and similar to what a Bloomberg Terminal might offer.
- **Strengths**: Splunk’s real-time visualization capabilities are very powerful, and the free version allows for a limited volume of data, which might be sufficient for monitoring a smaller set of news feeds.
- **Cons**: The **free tier** is limited in terms of data volume, and a paid version can become quite costly. Requires setup for RSS ingestion.

### **Recommendation Summary:**
If you're looking for a **single self-hosted solution** that can manage **RSS aggregation** and **dashboard creation**:
- **Huginn** stands out as the best option due to its versatility, ability to aggregate and automate tasks, and its potential to create a powerful dashboard—all in one place.
- **Miniflux + Custom Dashboard Extension** can work well if you're willing to build a simple dashboard extension yourself, allowing you to keep everything tightly integrated without needing separate software for visualizations.
- **Wazuh with Kibana** offers a powerful visualization front end, but you will need to customize data ingestion to support RSS.

For a more **out-of-the-box** approach with moderate setup requirements, **Matomo** can also be adapted for both **RSS ingestion** and **dashboards**, offering powerful visual analytics in a single system.
