# Prompt

 nativefier looks great. But I feel like there has to be a more elegant solution for grouping multiple sites into a display wrapper than configuring a bunch of separate apps to launch all at once. Do any of these tools have the ability to configure grid layouts like the one I'm envisioning and define the URLs to show in each part of that grid?
# Output

Based on your requirements for a more elegant solution to group multiple sites into a display wrapper with a configurable grid layout, there are a few options that come close, though none perfectly match your vision:

1. WebCatalog:
WebCatalog allows you to create custom "spaces" where you can group multiple web apps together. While it doesn't provide a grid layout out of the box, you can use its custom CSS injection feature to create a grid-like layout for your grouped apps[5].

2. Tangram:
Tangram is a GTK-based specialized web browser that allows you to pin multiple webapps into one native app GUI. It uses tabs for each of your webapps, which could potentially be customized to display in a grid-like format. However, it doesn't offer built-in grid layout functionality[5].

3. Ferdium:
Ferdium (a fork of Franz) allows you to group multiple web services into one application. While it doesn't offer a grid layout by default, it's open-source and could potentially be customized to display services in a grid format[5].

4. Custom Electron App:
Given your specific requirements, creating a custom Electron app might be the most flexible solution. You could use Electron's BrowserView or webview tag to load multiple URLs and arrange them in a grid layout. This would require some development work but would give you full control over the layout and functionality[5].

5. CSS Grid Layout with Custom Wrapper:
You could create a custom wrapper application (using Electron or another framework) that loads multiple URLs into iframes or webviews, then use CSS Grid Layout to arrange them in a grid. This would allow you to define the grid layout and URLs to show in each part of the grid[1][2].

While none of these solutions perfectly match your vision out of the box, they provide starting points that could be customized to achieve your desired result. The custom Electron app or CSS Grid Layout with a custom wrapper would likely offer the most flexibility in terms of creating the exact grid layout and URL configuration you're envisioning.
