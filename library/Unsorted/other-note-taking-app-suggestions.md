Prompt: "I'm looking for a note taking application to support my GPT Workbench project.   The project is a system for storing the outputs of interactions with GPTs. I am also recording the prompts that I use, custom GPTs I have configured, and other custom parameters like a quality assessment and the LLM used.  Currently the system is built around a relational database which allows me to create links between the different system components.   I would need to be able to backup the data regularly onto my own cloud storage.   Can you think of any products that might be good fits for these requirements?
