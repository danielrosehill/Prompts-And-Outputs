**Summary:** You are asking how to list the columns in the `documents` table using `psql` in PostgreSQL.

### Listing Columns in a Table Using `psql`

To view the columns of a table (like `documents`) in PostgreSQL, you can use the `\d` command in the `psql` command-line interface.

#### Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. **Connect to the PostgreSQL Database Using `psql`**
   - If youâ€™re inside the Docker container:
     ```bash
     psql -U outline -d outline
     ```
   - Replace `outline` with your PostgreSQL username and database name if they are different.

2. **List Columns in the `documents` Table**
   - Run the following command:
     ```sql
     \d documents
     ```
   - This will display the structure of the `documents` table, including:
     - Column names
     - Data types
     - Indexes and constraints

3. **View More Detailed Information (Optional)**
   - For even more details about the table, including descriptions, run:
     ```sql
     \d+ documents
     ```

### Example Output

When you run `\d documents`, you might see something like this:
```plaintext
                                    Table "public.documents"
   Column    |            Type             | Collation | Nullable |               Default
-------------+-----------------------------+-----------+----------+-------------------------------------
 id          | uuid                        |           | not null | uuid_generate_v4()
 title       | character varying           |           |          |
 content     | text                        |           |          |
 created_at  | timestamp without time zone |           | not null | now()
 updated_at  | timestamp without time zone |           | not null | now()
 user_id     | uuid                        |           |          |
 collection_id | uuid                      |           |          |
Indexes:
    "documents_pkey" PRIMARY KEY, btree (id)
```

### Summary
1. **Connect to the PostgreSQL database using `psql`.**
2. **Run `\d documents`** to list the columns and details of the `documents` table.
3. **Use `\d+ documents`** for more detailed information.

These commands will help you see how the `documents` table is structured, which can be useful for verifying that your Outline KM data is correctly stored.
