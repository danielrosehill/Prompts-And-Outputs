There are several online advocates and experts who have raised awareness about the effects of **blue light** exposure, particularly from screens. Some prominent voices in this area include:

1. **Dr. Jack Kruse**: A neurosurgeon who speaks extensively about the harmful effects of blue light on sleep, health, and circadian rhythms.
2. **James Swanwick**: Founder of Swanwick Sleep, a brand offering blue light-blocking glasses, and an advocate for limiting blue light exposure.
3. **The Light Diet (Matt Maruca)**: He promotes awareness of the health impacts of artificial lighting, particularly blue light, and advocates for natural light exposure.

These figures often speak about reducing blue light to improve sleep, mood, and overall health.
