Here are some effective solutions for creating a dedicated communication channel for important messages, given your requirements:

### 1. **Telegram with a Dedicated Group**
   - **Why:** Telegram allows you to create groups with customizable notification settings. You can set up a dedicated group for urgent messages that you can share with friends and work contacts. Notifications can be configured to bypass any Do Not Disturb settings.
   - **Setup:** 
     1. Install Telegram on your Fedora Linux desktop, your wife's Windows device, and her Android phone.
     2. Create a group specifically for urgent messages.
     3. Adjust notification settings to ensure they come through even when muted.

### 2. **Slack or Discord with Custom Alerts**
   - **Why:** Both Slack and Discord allow you to create channels or servers dedicated to specific topics. You can customize notifications to ensure that important messages alert you regardless of your focus mode.
   - **Setup:**
     1. Create a Slack workspace or Discord server.
     2. Set up a dedicated channel for important messages.
     3. Use specific keywords or code words to trigger notifications, which can be filtered.

### 3. **Using WhatsApp Groups**
   - **Why:** If you and your friends already use WhatsApp, you can create a group chat for urgent communication. You can customize notifications for this group to ensure you donâ€™t miss important messages.
   - **Setup:**
     1. Create a WhatsApp group for urgent communication.
     2. Adjust notification settings for this group to ensure they override other notifications.

### 4. **Zapier with Email Triggers**
   - **Why:** You can set up a simple email trigger using Zapier. Use a specific code word in the subject line of an email to route messages to a service that can send you a notification (like Slack, SMS, or Telegram).
   - **Setup:**
     1. Create a Zap that triggers when an email with a specific subject line is received.
     2. Choose an action to send you a notification via your preferred method (e.g., SMS or a messaging app).

### 5. **Dedicated VoIP Number for Urgent Calls**
   - **Why:** Set up a dedicated VoIP line that you can share for urgent communications. Calls to this number can be set to bypass Do Not Disturb settings.
   - **Setup:**
     1. Use a VoIP service like Google Voice or a similar platform.
     2. Share the number with your close contacts for emergencies.

### 6. **Using a Low-Use App with Notification Overrides**
   - **Why:** Consider using an app like Todoist or Microsoft To Do for a very specific purpose. You can set up tasks or reminders that will ping you, and configure notifications to ensure they come through.
   - **Setup:**
     1. Set up a project or list for urgent tasks.
     2. Configure notifications to be more prominent.

These options should give you a flexible and effective way to handle urgent communications without forcing your contacts into unfamiliar tools. You can combine some of these ideas, like using a dedicated group in Telegram while also setting up Zapier for email triggers, to create a robust system.
