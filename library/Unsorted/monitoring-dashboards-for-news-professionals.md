# Prompt

I'm looking to set up a custom dashboard for monitoring multiple broadcast news streams delivered over the internet. This dashboard would be for private use. I might also wish to add a couple of other elements to the dashboard. Are there any tools that allow you to create these kind of interfaces and which are designed for this purpose?

# Output

For setting up a custom dashboard for private monitoring of multiple broadcast news streams delivered over the internet, along with the flexibility to add other elements, there are several tools and platforms designed for creating custom interfaces. These tools often provide the necessary customization, flexibility, and media embedding capabilities suitable for your needs. Here are some platforms that stand out for this purpose:

### 1. **OBS Studio with Custom Web-based Dashboards**
   - **Features**: OBS Studio is primarily a streaming and recording tool, but it can also be used to monitor multiple video feeds by setting up a customized layout. By embedding OBS streams into a private webpage or local HTML file with embedded live news streams, you can create a tailored dashboard for private use.
   - **Customization**: You can use CSS and HTML to add other elements around the streams or integrate with a framework like Flask or Node.js for added functionality.

### 2. **Stream Deck with Custom Interfaces**
   - **Features**: Elgato’s Stream Deck can be customized to create an interface that allows for switching between different news streams and additional elements like alerts, widgets, or even smart home integrations.
   - **Use Case**: Though Stream Deck is generally used for streaming control, its customization options make it a viable tool for creating interactive dashboards that can display web streams and other elements through connected devices.

### 3. **Screenly OSE (Open Source Edition)**
   - **Features**: Screenly OSE is an open-source digital signage solution that allows you to display content such as web pages, video streams, and other widgets on screens. It runs on a Raspberry Pi, enabling you to create a private, localized dashboard.
   - **Customization**: While Screenly OSE is typically used for digital signage, its open-source nature allows you to tailor it for a private monitoring dashboard, ideal for displaying multiple news streams and adding various informational widgets.

### 4. **Grafana**
   - **Features**: Grafana is typically used for data visualization, but it also supports embedding web content and live video streams. With plugins and custom panels, you can add news streams, along with other elements like text boxes, graphs, or alerts.
   - **Customization**: Grafana provides robust options for layout customization, so you can organize the dashboard to show both live streams and additional metrics or elements that you might need.

### 5. **Webflow (with Custom Embeds)**
   - **Features**: Webflow is a no-code web design tool that allows you to create custom websites and dashboards with embedded elements, including live video streams. It also provides options for integrating third-party widgets and customizing the interface with drag-and-drop elements.
   - **Customization**: You can set up a private dashboard with Webflow, which allows for custom embeds and custom CSS/JavaScript. It’s an accessible option for those who want to avoid coding and need a polished interface.
