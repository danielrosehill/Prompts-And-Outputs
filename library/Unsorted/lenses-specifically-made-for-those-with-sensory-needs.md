Yes, there are **lenses and spectacles** specifically designed for individuals who are sensitive to light (known as **photophobia**), as well as for those who may find bright light stressful or anxiety-inducing. These lenses are typically designed to filter out certain wavelengths of light that can be harsh or overwhelming to the eyes and nervous system. Here are some of the most popular options for light sensitivity:

### 1. **FL-41 Tinted Lenses**
   - **FL-41 lenses** are one of the most recommended solutions for those with light sensitivity, particularly for people prone to migraines, photophobia, or anxiety caused by bright lights. These lenses have a **rose or amber tint**, which blocks specific wavelengths in the blue and green spectrum that are often triggers for discomfort.
   - **Who it's for**: People with light sensitivity, migraines, or anxiety.
   - **Pros**: Can significantly reduce light-triggered discomfort and are often prescribed by doctors for conditions like photophobia or migraines.
   - **Cons**: The tint can alter color perception slightly, which may not be ideal for everyone.

   **Brands**:
   - **Axon Optics**: Specializes in FL-41 lenses for migraine sufferers and those with photophobia.
   - **TheraSpecs**: Offers FL-41 tinted lenses designed to filter out light that causes discomfort.

### 2. **Blue Light Blocking Glasses**
   - **Blue light blocking glasses** are often marketed for reducing digital eye strain, but they can also be effective for those sensitive to light. These glasses filter out **blue light** (the high-energy visible light emitted by screens and LED lighting), which can contribute to discomfort, eye strain, and anxiety.
   - **Who it's for**: People who find screen light or artificial lighting overwhelming or stressful.
   - **Pros**: Helps with digital eye strain and can make screen use more comfortable.
   - **Cons**: Doesnâ€™t block other types of light (such as bright sunlight), so it may not be sufficient for extreme light sensitivity.

   **Brands**:
   - **Gunnar Optiks**: A popular brand known for blue light blocking glasses with tints that reduce eye strain and light sensitivity.
   - **J+S Vision**: Offers more affordable blue light blocking glasses.

### 3. **Polarized Sunglasses**
   - **Polarized sunglasses** reduce glare from reflective surfaces like water, snow, or windows. These lenses are highly effective for individuals with light sensitivity caused by bright outdoor environments.
   - **Who it's for**: People with outdoor light sensitivity, especially in bright conditions.
   - **Pros**: Reduces harsh glare and can make outdoor environments more comfortable.
   - **Cons**: Primarily for outdoor use, not as useful for indoor light sensitivity.

   **Brands**:
   - **Ray-Ban** and **Maui Jim**: Both offer high-quality polarized lenses that reduce glare and improve comfort in bright conditions.

### 4. **Transition Lenses (Photochromic Lenses)**
   - **Transition lenses** automatically adjust to different light levels by darkening in bright environments and becoming clear indoors. These lenses can be useful for people sensitive to changes in light intensity, as they eliminate the need to switch between sunglasses and regular glasses.
   - **Who it's for**: Individuals with sensitivity to changing light environments, both indoors and outdoors.
   - **Pros**: Convenient for people who move between indoor and outdoor environments frequently.
   - **Cons**: Transitioning between clear and tinted can take a few seconds, and they may not darken enough in cars due to UV-blocking windshields.

   **Brands**:
   - **Transitions**: The most well-known brand of photochromic lenses, available in various tints.

### 5. **Therapeutic Tinted Lenses**
   - Some glasses are designed to filter out specific wavelengths of light that can trigger sensory overload or stress, particularly for those with conditions like **sensory processing disorder** or **autism**. These therapeutic lenses often have subtle tints like **yellow**, **amber**, or **rose**, which reduce the harshness of bright lights without fully blocking vision.
   - **Who it's for**: Individuals with heightened sensitivity to sensory stimuli, including those with sensory processing disorders, autism, or anxiety related to light exposure.
   - **Pros**: Customized to individual needs and can significantly improve comfort in harsh lighting environments.
   - **Cons**: Can alter color perception; may require some adjustment to get used to the tint.

   **Brands**:
   - **IrisTech**: Offers therapeutic glasses designed to reduce anxiety and sensory overload by altering the brightness and harshness of light.

### 6. **Irlens Spectral Filters**
   - **Irlen Spectral Filters** are customized colored filters designed to help those with **Irlen Syndrome** (a condition where certain wavelengths of light cause discomfort). These filters are intended to minimize light-induced stress, improve focus, and reduce discomfort from fluorescent lighting, which can be a trigger for anxiety and sensory overload.
   - **Who it's for**: People diagnosed with **Irlen Syndrome** or those experiencing discomfort from bright or flickering lights.
   - **Pros**: Tailored to specific sensitivities; offers significant relief from indoor lighting.
   - **Cons**: Requires an Irlen screening to determine the specific color tint that works best.

   **Brands**:
   - **Irlen Institute**: Offers customized lenses for light sensitivity and associated symptoms like anxiety, headaches, and reading difficulties.

### 7. **Yellow or Amber Tinted Glasses (for Anxiety and Light Sensitivity)**
   - **Yellow or amber tinted glasses** reduce the harsh contrast and brightness of light, often resulting in a more soothing visual experience. These are especially effective for people sensitive to artificial light sources, such as **fluorescent lights**.
   - **Who it's for**: Individuals sensitive to indoor lighting or prone to anxiety from bright environments.
   - **Pros**: They create a calming effect by reducing harsh brightness and enhancing contrast.
   - **Cons**: They may distort colors, especially under natural light.

   **Brands**:
   - **Blutech Lenses**: Known for their amber-tinted lenses designed for indoor and outdoor light sensitivity.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Prescription Options**: Most of these lenses and glasses are available in both **non-prescription** and **prescription** formats.
- **Customization**: For people with more severe light sensitivity or specific needs (such as certain medical conditions), working with a professional optometrist can lead to **customized lenses** tailored to block the precise wavelengths that cause discomfort.
- **Screen Filters**: In addition to lenses, you can use **screen filters** for your devices, which reduce blue light and flicker, helping to reduce sensory overload caused by digital screens.

These solutions offer various levels of light filtering and protection depending on your specific needs, whether you're dealing with anxiety, migraines, or general light sensitivity. Let me know if you need help choosing one or finding where to get them!
