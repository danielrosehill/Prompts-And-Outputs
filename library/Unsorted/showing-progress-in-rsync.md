To modify your `rsync` command to show a **progress meter**, you can add the `--progress` option. Here's the updated command:

```bash
rsync -avz --progress homeboxdata/ root@192.168.1.1:/home/root/homeboxdata/
```

### Explanation:
- `--progress`: Displays the progress of the file transfer, including file size, percentage, and speed.
- The rest of the flags (`-a`, `-v`, `-z`) remain the same:
  - `-a`: Archive mode (preserves permissions, symlinks, etc.).
  - `-v`: Verbose output (shows files being transferred).
  - `-z`: Compresses data during the transfer.

This will now display a progress meter for each file being transferred.

# Progress for whole process

To show the progress of the **entire transfer** and not just for individual files, you can add the `--info=progress2` option to your `rsync` command. This will display the overall progress of the entire transfer, including the total data transferred and the transfer speed.

Hereâ€™s the modified command:

```bash
rsync -avz --info=progress2 homeboxdata/ root@192.168.1.1:/home/root/homeboxdata/
```

### Explanation:
- `--info=progress2`: Shows the progress for the entire transfer, including total transferred bytes, transfer speed, and time remaining.

This will give you a summary of the overall progress of the entire data transfer.
