To test if a URL is being blocked by Cloudflare Access, you can follow these steps:

1. Access the URL from a Private/Incognito Window:

Open the URL in a private or incognito browser window. This bypasses any existing session cookies or cached access, ensuring you're testing it as a new visitor.

If Cloudflare Access is properly configured, you should be prompted to log in or verify your access.



2. Use curl Command:

Open a terminal and run:

curl -I https://example.com

Replace https://example.com with the URL you are testing.

If Cloudflare Access is blocking it, you might see a 403 Forbidden or a redirect to an authentication page.



3. Access the URL from a Different Network or Device:

To further confirm, try accessing the URL from a different network or device (e.g., using a mobile network instead of Wi-Fi or a VPN).

This can help rule out whether any local network settings are influencing your access.



4. Check Cloudflare Access Logs:

Go to the Cloudflare dashboard and check the Access logs under Access > Logs.

You can see if an attempt was made to access the URL and whether it was blocked or authenticated.




These methods should help you confirm if the URL is correctly protected by Cloudflare Access.
