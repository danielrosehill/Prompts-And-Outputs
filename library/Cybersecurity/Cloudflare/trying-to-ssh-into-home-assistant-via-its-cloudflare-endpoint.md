# Prompt

Give me an example of how to connect. My Home Assistant is ha.testhomewebsite.com but when I try to SSH as root@ha.testhomewebsite.com nothing happens

Please note: I'm using a mini PC at testhomewebsite.com to act as an ingress Gateway. The Cloudflare tunnel terminates there

# Output

Since your Cloudflare tunnel terminates on the **mini PC** acting as the **ingress gateway**, you need to ensure that the tunnel correctly forwards **SSH traffic** to your **Home Assistant** (ha.testhomewebsite.com) from the mini PC.

### Steps to Connect via SSH Through the Cloudflare Tunnel

1. **Configure the Cloudflare Tunnel for SSH**:
   Youâ€™ll need to modify the **ingress configuration** on the mini PC to forward SSH traffic to your Home Assistant instance at `192.168.1.3`. This is done by updating the `cloudflared` config file on the mini PC (where the tunnel terminates).

   Here's an example `config.yml`:

   ```yaml
   tunnel: your-tunnel-id
   credentials-file: /root/.cloudflared/your-tunnel-id.json

   ingress:
     - hostname: ha.testhomewebsite.com
       service: ssh://192.168.1.3:22  # This forwards SSH traffic to Home Assistant
     - hostname: testhomewebsite.com
       service: http://localhost:8080  # Other services can be configured similarly
     - service: http_status:404
   ```

   This setup ensures that any SSH request to `ha.testhomewebsite.com` is forwarded to the **Home Assistant** instance at `192.168.1.3:22`.

2. **Restart Cloudflared**:
   After editing the configuration, restart the `cloudflared` service on the mini PC to apply the changes:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart cloudflared
   ```

3. **Try SSH Connection Again**:
   Now, try connecting via SSH from your Fedora desktop to `ha.testhomewebsite.com` through the tunnel:

   ```bash
   ssh root@ha.testhomewebsite.com
   ```

   If the configuration is correct, this will forward the connection from the **mini PC** ingress gateway to the **Home Assistant** instance.

### Additional Considerations:

- **Ensure SSH is Enabled on Home Assistant**: Verify that **SSH** is enabled and accessible on your **Home Assistant** instance (`192.168.1.3`). You can test this by connecting directly to the local IP from another device:
  
   ```bash
   ssh root@192.168.1.3
   ```

- **Firewall Rules**: Ensure that your **Home Assistant** system allows SSH connections on port 22, and that your mini PC can forward this traffic.

- **Check the Cloudflared Logs**: If SSH is still not working, you can check the `cloudflared` logs on the mini PC for any errors or clues:
  
   ```bash
   sudo journalctl -u cloudflared
   ```

### Summary:
1. Ensure that the **cloudflared** configuration on the **mini PC** is forwarding SSH traffic (`ssh://192.168.1.3:22`) for `ha.testhomewebsite.com`.
2. Restart the tunnel service and try connecting via SSH using `ssh root@ha.testhomewebsite.com`.
