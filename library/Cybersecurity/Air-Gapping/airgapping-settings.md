Air-gapped networks are provisioned in various high-security environments where the protection of sensitive data or critical systems is paramount. These networks are physically isolated from unsecured networks, including the internet, to minimize the risk of cyberattacks. Some common situations where air-gapped networks are used include:

### 1. Military and Governmental Systems

Air-gapped networks are frequently employed in military and intelligence operations to protect classified information and ensure national security. For example, systems like the U.S. Department of Defense's Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNet) are air-gapped to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive defense data\[1]\[3].

### 2. Critical Infrastructure

Systems that manage essential services such as power grids, water utilities, and nuclear power plants often use air-gapped networks to prevent cyber threats from disrupting operations. These environments require a high level of security due to the potentially catastrophic consequences of a breach\[1]\[3].

### 3. Financial Institutions

Banks, stock exchanges, and other financial entities use air-gapped networks to protect sensitive financial data, such as transaction histories and personal customer information. This helps prevent fraud and data breaches that could severely impact financial markets\[1]\[7].

### 4. Industrial Control Systems (ICS)

Air-gapped networks are used in industrial control systems, including Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems in industries like oil, gas, and manufacturing. These systems control critical operations and must be protected from external threats to avoid operational disruptions or safety hazards\[1]\[4].

### 5. Healthcare

Hospitals and healthcare providers use air-gapped networks to secure patient records and medical devices. This isolation helps ensure compliance with regulations like HIPAA while protecting sensitive health data from unauthorized access or cyberattacks\[3]\[7].

### 6. Aviation and Transportation

Air traffic control systems, avionics, and other aviation-related networks often employ air-gapping to ensure the safety and reliability of flight operations. These systems must remain isolated to prevent any interference that could jeopardize passenger safety\[1].

### 7. Lottery Systems

National lottery machines and random number generators are often air-gapped to prevent fraud or tampering with lottery results, ensuring the integrity of the games\[1].

In all these cases, air-gapping is used as a robust security measure to protect against external threats by physically isolating critical systems from unsecured networks. However, this approach also introduces challenges in terms of data transfer, maintenance, and updates, which must be performed manually or through secure physical media like USB drives\[4].
