# Prompt

here's what I would say about that, then. The data is encrypted at rest on the server side (in B2). But it's in plaintext on my local. Is that still considered "end to end" encryption? I thought that meant that the data needed to be encrypted at rest wherever it was

# Output

You're absolutely right to raise this point, and it touches on an important distinction in how encryption is implemented. Let's clarify the term **End-to-End Encryption (E2EE)** and whether it applies in your case.

### **1. What End-to-End Encryption (E2EE) Typically Means**:
In a traditional **E2EE** setup, data is encrypted **on the client side** (before leaving your device), and it stays **encrypted** both during transmission and while stored (at rest) on any server. The key idea is that **only the communicating parties** (your devices) can decrypt the data, and no intermediary (such as a cloud provider) can access or decrypt it.

In **E2EE**, even if the data is stored on a cloud server (like Backblaze B2), it remains encrypted at rest, and the cloud provider cannot access the plaintext data. The encryption and decryption occur **exclusively on the client side** (your devices), and the encryption keys never leave your control.

### **2. Your Current Setup**:
In your case, the data stored on Backblaze B2 is encrypted (thanks to the sync plugin), but it is stored in plaintext on your local device. Here's how this fits in with the **E2EE** definition:

- **Local Device (Plaintext)**: On your local machine (laptop or phone), the files are stored in plaintext, and no encryption is applied.
- **During Sync (Encryption Happens)**: The sync tool (e.g., Obsidian Sync or another plugin) encrypts your files when they're sent to Backblaze B2.
- **Cloud Storage (Encrypted)**: The data is encrypted at rest on Backblaze B2, and the cloud provider cannot see the contents.

### **Is This Still Considered E2EE?**
Technically, **no**, this setup would **not** be considered **End-to-End Encryption (E2EE)** because:

- **In E2EE**, data is supposed to be encrypted **at all points**—both in transit and at rest, **including on your local device**.
- In your case, while data is encrypted **on the cloud (Backblaze B2)** and **during transit**, it is **not encrypted at rest on your local device**. This breaks the full E2EE model, because E2EE would require the data to be **encrypted at rest on your local device** as well.

### **3. Difference Between E2EE and Client-Side Encryption**:
Your current setup is better described as **Client-Side Encryption (CSE)**:

- **Client-Side Encryption (CSE)**: Encryption happens on your device before the data is sent to the cloud, but the data might still be in **plaintext** on your device itself. The encryption is applied to protect the data from cloud providers and third parties during transmission and storage in the cloud.
  
This is different from **E2EE**, where the data would remain encrypted **everywhere**, including on your local device.

### **4. Why the Distinction Matters**:
- **E2EE**: Guarantees that only the intended recipient (you or another trusted device) can decrypt the data, and the data remains encrypted **everywhere**, including on your local machine.
- **Client-Side Encryption (CSE)**: Focuses on ensuring the data is protected from third-party access (e.g., cloud providers), but it does **not** necessarily mean the data is encrypted on your local device.

### **5. How to Achieve Full E2EE (with Encryption at Rest Locally)**:
If you want to achieve **full E2EE**, where your data is encrypted both **in the cloud** and **on your local machine**, you would need to:
- Use a local encryption tool or plugin that **encrypts your vault** (or specific folders) on your local device as well, so that even at rest on your device, the data is encrypted.
- Obsidian, for example, has third-party plugins that can encrypt vaults locally, or you could use an external tool like **Veracrypt** to encrypt your vault folder at rest.

### **Summary**:
- **Your current setup** is **Client-Side Encryption (CSE)**: The data is encrypted before it’s uploaded to the cloud, but it remains **plaintext** on your local device.
- **End-to-End Encryption (E2EE)**: Would require the data to be encrypted **at rest** on both the cloud and the local device. Your current setup doesn't meet this strict definition.
- If you're concerned about ensuring full E2EE, you would need to use a local encryption solution to ensure that the data is encrypted on your local machine as well as in the cloud.

If you're okay with the current setup (plaintext locally but encrypted in the cloud), **Client-Side Encryption** is still a very secure solution. However, if you want **complete E2EE** (with encryption at rest on your local device too), you’ll need to look into local vault encryption options.

# So I'm currently using client side

The model you're describing, where data is stored in plaintext on your local device but **encrypted before it is uploaded to the cloud** (and remains encrypted at rest on the cloud provider), is typically referred to as **Client-Side Encryption (CSE)**.

### **Client-Side Encryption (CSE) Model**:
In **Client-Side Encryption (CSE)**:
- Data is **unencrypted** (plaintext) on your local device.
- **Encryption happens** on the client side (your local device) **before** the data is sent to a cloud provider or remote server.
- The encrypted data is stored in the cloud (Backblaze B2 in your case) and remains encrypted at rest on the server.
- The cloud provider (e.g., Backblaze) **does not have access** to the encryption keys, so it cannot decrypt the data stored on its servers.
- **Decryption occurs** locally when the data is pulled back from the cloud to your device, allowing you to interact with the data in plaintext on your local device.

### **Key Features of Client-Side Encryption (CSE)**:
- **Client-Controlled Encryption**: You (the client) are in full control of the encryption and decryption processes. The cloud provider only stores the encrypted data and does not manage the keys.
- **Data is encrypted in transit and at rest** on the cloud, but **not necessarily at rest on your local device**.
- **Security**: The cloud provider has no access to your unencrypted data or your encryption keys, ensuring that your data remains secure in the cloud.

### **Why It's Not E2EE**:
While this model is secure, it's **not considered full End-to-End Encryption (E2EE)** because:
- In **E2EE**, data remains encrypted both on the cloud and on your local device (at rest on both ends).
- In your setup, the data is **unencrypted** locally on your device, which breaks the strict definition of E2EE.

### **Typical Use Cases for Client-Side Encryption (CSE)**:
- **Cloud storage services** (like Backblaze B2, Google Drive, Dropbox) where users want to encrypt their data before uploading it to the cloud to ensure that the cloud provider cannot access or read the data.
- **Backup solutions** where users need to protect sensitive data stored in the cloud, while retaining easy access to unencrypted data on their local devices.

### **Examples of CSE Tools**:
- **rclone with crypt**: rclone's `crypt` feature is a good example of a CSE tool where the data is encrypted on the client before being sent to cloud storage.
- **Obsidian Sync with encryption**: This also functions similarly by encrypting files client-side before uploading them to the cloud.
- **Syncthing (with encryption)**: Allows encrypted syncing of files between devices or to cloud storage, while keeping files in plaintext locally.

### **Summary**:
- **Client-Side Encryption (CSE)** is the best term for your current model, where data is encrypted before being sent to the cloud but is unencrypted on your local machine.
- This model ensures that **the cloud provider cannot access your data**, but the data is still stored in plaintext on your local device, meaning it’s not full **End-to-End Encryption (E2EE)**.
  
If you're satisfied with this level of security, it's still a strong model, especially for protecting data in the cloud from unauthorized access. However, if you want local encryption as well, you'll need to implement additional local encryption methods to meet the E2EE standard.
