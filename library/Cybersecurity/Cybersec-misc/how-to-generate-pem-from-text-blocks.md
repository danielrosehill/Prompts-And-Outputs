If you have the certificate and private key as text blocks, you can easily convert them into `.pem` format by saving the text to files with the `.pem` extension.

### Steps to Convert Certificate and Private Key to PEM Format:

#### 1. **Save the Certificate as a `.pem` File**:
If your certificate is in a text block (typically base64-encoded and wrapped with `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----` and `-----END CERTIFICATE-----`), follow these steps:

- Open a text editor (e.g., `nano`, `vim`, or any text editor you prefer).
- Copy the certificate text block, including the `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----` and `-----END CERTIFICATE-----` lines.
- Paste it into the editor.
- Save the file as `certificate.pem`.

Example of a certificate text block:
```
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
xxxxxxxMIIBCgKCAQEArfXOP3qu1K9/M0zZVvn1
...
uDPzJ62OGlZ34v/xxxxxxx5Q==
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

Save this in a file called `certificate.pem`.

#### 2. **Save the Private Key as a `.pem` File**:
Similarly, if you have the private key in text format (typically starting with `-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----` and ending with `-----END PRIVATE KEY-----`):

- Open a text editor.
- Copy the private key text block, including the `-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----` and `-----END PRIVATE KEY-----` lines.
- Paste it into the editor.
- Save the file as `privatekey.pem`.

Example of a private key text block:
```
-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
xxxxxxxAmIwggJeAgEAAoIBAQCxf...
...
xxxxxxxHVjigk1Q==
-----END PRIVATE KEY-----
```

Save this in a file called `privatekey.pem`.

#### 3. **Ensure Correct Formatting**:
- Ensure there are no extra spaces or line breaks between the `BEGIN`/`END` headers and the encoded text.
- The `.pem` files should be plain text, with the base64-encoded content and the correct header/footer lines.

### Verifying the `.pem` Files:
Once you have saved the certificate and private key in `.pem` format, you can verify them using OpenSSL to ensure they are valid.

To check the certificate:
```bash
openssl x509 -in certificate.pem -text -noout
```

To check the private key:
```bash
openssl rsa -in privatekey.pem -check
```

This will output details about the certificate and key, confirming that they are correctly formatted. You can now use these `.pem` files for Cloudflare or other services requiring PEM-formatted certificates and keys.
