### 5. **Terminal Markdown Editors**:
   While the tools above are primarily focused on **viewing** Markdown files, there are also Markdown editors built for the terminal that allow you to both **edit** and **preview** Markdown files in real time:

     - You can configure **Vim** with the **vim-markdown** plugin to get Markdown syntax highlighting, folding, and real-time previews within the terminal.
     - **Installation**:
       ```bash
       sudo dnf install vim
       ```
       Then, install the **vim-markdown** plugin through a package manager like **vim-plug**.
       ```vim
       Plug 'plasticboy/vim-markdown'
       ```
     - This setup allows full Markdown editing capabilities with powerful search and navigation built into Vim.

For Markdown-specific terminal-based tools, **Glow** and **Marker** provide the most polished viewing experience, while tools like **Vim** or **Neovim** with Markdown plugins offer powerful editing capabilities with built-in syntax highlighting and navigation. If you’re looking for a presentation tool, **mdp** turns your Markdown into terminal slides, which can also be useful for interactive browsing of Markdown documents.
