**Title: Imminent Iranian Attack or Security Escalation SOP**

### **Purpose**
This SOP outlines the necessary steps to take in the event of an imminent Iranian attack or other serious security escalation. The focus is on monitoring news, ensuring early alerts, and having adequate time to find shelter.

### **1. News Monitoring**
- **Local News Channels**: Regularly monitor trusted news channels like **Kan 11**, **Ynet**, or **The Jerusalem Post** for updates regarding any security threats.
- **Official Government Alerts**: Set up notifications for official government alerts on your smartphone. The **Home Front Command** app is highly recommended for receiving real-time updates about security threats.
- **Social Media**: Follow credible social media accounts from the **Home Front Command**, **local news agencies**, and **government officials** to stay informed.

### **2. Early Warning System**
- **Home Front Command App**: Install and configure the **Home Front Command app** on all mobile devices. This app provides real-time alerts, including sirens and instructions, to help you react immediately.
- **Notifications**: Ensure notifications are turned on and the volume is sufficient to hear alerts at any time, especially during sleeping hours.

### **3. Shelter Preparedness**
- **Identify Safe Zones**: Pre-identify the nearest **shelter or secure area** within your building. For your apartment, the **stairwell** is the recommended shelter, and there is a more secure shelter approximately **five minutes away**.
- **Prepare a Go-Bag**:
  - **Contents**: Include essential items such as water, non-perishable snacks, flashlight, phone charger, essential medications, copies of identification, a first aid kit, and a portable radio.
  - **Location**: Keep the go-bag near the door or another easy-to-access spot so that it can be grabbed quickly in an emergency.
- **Comfortable Clothing**: Keep **comfortable shoes and a jacket** near the door to prepare for a rapid evacuation.

### **4. Evacuation Procedures**
- **Immediate Response**: If a warning is issued, proceed immediately to the secure area or nearest shelter.
- **Family Members**: Ensure that all members of the household are accounted for and safely move to the shelter together.
- **Emergency Drills**: Conduct regular drills to ensure everyone knows the route to the shelter and understands what to do in an emergency.

### **5. Communication Plan**
- **Inform Family Members**: Once safely sheltered, inform family members of your location and status. Use pre-arranged **WhatsApp groups** or **SMS messages** to provide updates.
- **Backup Communication**: If phone networks are down, use **walkie-talkies** or a **satellite phone** if available. Establish pre-determined codes or signals to communicate key messages effectively.

### **6. Post-Escalation Actions**
- **Listen for Updates**: Once the immediate threat has passed, stay in the shelter and listen for official updates regarding when it is safe to leave. Only leave when the **all-clear** is given by authorities.
- **Assess Damage**: After exiting the shelter, assess any damage to your property and ensure that it is safe to stay. Avoid touching any suspicious objects or unexploded ordnance and report them to authorities immediately.
- **Emergency Contacts**: Contact friends and family to inform them of your safety and check on their status.

### **7. Regular Review and Updates**
- **Monthly Review**: Set a monthly reminder to review this SOP and ensure that all emergency supplies are stocked and in good condition.
- **Annual Drill**: Conduct an annual drill simulating an evacuation to the nearest shelter. This will help everyone stay familiar with the procedure and identify any areas for improvement.
- **Update as Needed**: Review and update this SOP whenever there are significant changes, such as moving to a new apartment or changes in the neighborhood's security infrastructure.

### **Summary**
This SOP aims to ensure that you and Hannah are prepared to respond quickly and safely in the event of an imminent Iranian attack or serious security escalation. By staying informed, having a well-prepared shelter plan, and communicating effectively, you can minimize risks and maintain safety during critical situations.
