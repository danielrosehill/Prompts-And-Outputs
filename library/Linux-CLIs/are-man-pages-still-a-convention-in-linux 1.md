Man pages are still a widely used convention for documentation, especially for **command-line utilities**, **system tools**, and **software packages** in Unix-like environments, including Fedora. They offer quick, local access to information without needing an internet connection.

However, there has been a significant shift toward **GitHub** and other platforms for more detailed, collaborative, and visually rich documentation. GitHub provides the advantage of easy updates, contributions, and better integration with modern development workflows. Many projects now include **README** files, **wikis**, and **GitHub Pages** for comprehensive guides, while man pages remain essential for quick, on-system reference.
