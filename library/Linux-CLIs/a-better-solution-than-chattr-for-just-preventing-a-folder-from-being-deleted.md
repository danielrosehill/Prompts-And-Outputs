# Prompt

Ah, so chattr isn't exactly what I need then. Here's the situation. I have a folder (homeboxdata) which is constantly being written to by a program. I just want to prevent myself from accidentally deleting the folder. But clearly it can't be immutable. Do you have a solution?

# Output

In your case, where you want to **prevent accidental deletion** of the `homeboxdata` folder but still allow it to be written to by a program, the **immutable** attribute (`chattr +i`) isn’t ideal because it blocks all changes, including writing new data. Instead, you can **restrict your own user permissions** specifically for **deletion** without preventing the program from writing to the folder.

Here’s how to achieve that:

### Solution: Adjust Permissions for Your User

The idea is to remove the ability for your user to delete the folder (or its contents) while still allowing programs to write to it.

1. **Change Folder Ownership**:
   Make the program that writes to the folder the owner of the folder, and assign yourself permissions as a non-owner.

2. **Modify Permissions**:
   Use permissions to restrict yourself from deleting the folder but still allow writing to the folder.

### Steps to Set This Up:

1. **Create a Group (if necessary)**:
   If the program and your user aren't in the same group, create a group that both the program and you belong to:
   ```bash
   sudo groupadd datawriters
   sudo usermod -aG datawriters yourusername
   ```

2. **Change the Ownership of the Folder**:
   Set the program's user as the owner of the folder, and your group as the group owner:
   ```bash
   sudo chown programuser:datawriters /path/to/homeboxdata
   ```

3. **Set Permissions on the Folder**:
   Set folder permissions so that the program can write, but your user can’t delete the folder or its contents:
   ```bash
   sudo chmod 1775 /path/to/homeboxdata
   ```

   - `1` sets the **sticky bit**, which prevents users from deleting or renaming files unless they are the owner.
   - `775` allows the program to read/write/execute, but prevents your user from deleting the folder or its contents while still allowing read/write access.

### Why This Works:
- **Sticky bit (1)**: Prevents users from deleting or renaming files they do not own.
- **Group ownership**: Allows you to access the folder for other operations like reading and writing.
- **Ownership change**: Ensures the program retains write access, while your user is protected from deleting the folder accidentally.

### Optional: Set Up an Alias to Make `rm` Safer
For an additional safeguard, you can also set up an alias for `rm` that prompts you for confirmation before deletion:
1. Open your `.bashrc`:
   ```bash
   nano ~/.bashrc
   ```
2. Add the following line:
   ```bash
   alias rm='rm -i'
   ```

3. Reload the configuration:
   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

Now, `rm` will ask for confirmation before deleting any file or folder, adding an extra layer of protection.

### Conclusion:
By setting the **sticky bit** and adjusting ownership, you’ll prevent accidental deletion of the `homeboxdata` folder without making it immutable, allowing your program to keep writing to it while safeguarding the folder from accidental deletion by your user.
