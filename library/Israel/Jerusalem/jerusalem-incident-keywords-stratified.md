# Prompt

Could you take the list of keywords that you generated for Jerusalem and attempt to categorise them by threat level. For instance, some keywords may only represent low level security incidents while others could indicate very grave ones

# Output

Here’s a categorization of the **Jerusalem-focused security keywords** based on their **threat levels**. This is a subjective categorization based on the potential gravity of each keyword in a real-world security context. It helps to differentiate between incidents that might represent minor unrest and those indicating severe, life-threatening events.

### **High Threat Level (Grave Incidents)**
These keywords indicate severe, life-threatening incidents such as terrorist attacks, bombings, or armed assaults. These would typically trigger an immediate, urgent response from security services.

- **"Terrorist attack in Jerusalem"**
- **"Shooting in Jerusalem"**
- **"Explosion in Jerusalem"**
- **"Rocket attack Jerusalem"**
- **"Bus bombing in Jerusalem"**
- **"Shooting at Jerusalem central bus station"**
- **"Attack at Al-Aqsa Mosque"**
- **"Rocket sirens in Jerusalem"**
- **"Checkpoint attack in Jerusalem"**
- **"Bombing in Jerusalem"**
- **"Terrorist attack in East Jerusalem"**
- **"Temple Mount incident"**
- **"Terrorist targeting tram in Jerusalem"**

### **Moderate Threat Level (Serious Incidents)**
These keywords suggest significant security incidents that might involve violence, unrest, or potential escalation. They may not be immediately life-threatening to the general public but could indicate targeted attacks or clashes.

- **"Gunmen in Jerusalem"**
- **"Jerusalem police shooting"**
- **"Violence in East Jerusalem"**
- **"Clashes at Sheikh Jarrah"**
- **"IDF operations in Jerusalem"**
- **"Public transportation attack Jerusalem"**
- **"Attack on Jerusalem Light Rail"**
- **"Attack at Damascus Gate"**
- **"Shooting near Western Wall"**

### **Low Threat Level (Minor or Isolated Incidents)**
These keywords are associated with incidents that might still require a security response but are more likely to involve localized or minor threats. These may involve isolated violence or unrest that does not pose an immediate risk to large numbers of people.

- **"Security incident in Jerusalem"**
- **"Suspected terrorist Jerusalem"**
- **"Jerusalem lockdown"**
- **"Security breach at Damascus Gate"**
- **"Terror warning Jerusalem"**
- **"Security forces in Jerusalem"**
- **"Jerusalem travel warning"**
- **"IDF security warning Jerusalem"**
- **"Curfew in Jerusalem"**

### **Key Considerations for Customizing Alerts:**
- **High Threat Level** keywords should trigger **immediate alerts** as these often involve large-scale or life-threatening events.
- **Moderate Threat Level** keywords could trigger **medium-priority alerts** that require monitoring, as these events could escalate.
- **Low Threat Level** keywords could trigger **low-priority alerts** that may not need immediate action but are worth being aware of.

By categorizing keywords based on **threat level**, you can tailor the severity of alerts you receive, ensuring that you’re notified appropriately depending on the gravity of the incident.
