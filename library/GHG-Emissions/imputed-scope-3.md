Companies commonly "impute" or estimate their Scope 3 emissions using a variety of techniques due to the complexity of gathering direct data across their entire value chain. Scope 3 emissions refer to indirect emissions that occur both upstream and downstream in a company’s value chain, and they are notoriously difficult to measure because they involve external suppliers, customers, and other third parties. Here are some of the specific techniques used to estimate or impute these emissions:

## 1. Spend-Based Method

This method estimates emissions based on the amount of money spent on goods and services. It uses **secondary emission factors** that represent average emissions per unit of currency spent in a particular industry. This method is popular because it is relatively easy to implement using financial data from accounting systems, but it is less accurate as it relies on industry averages rather than specific data from suppliers\[1]\[4].

### Advantages:

- Easy to implement with readily available data.
- Scalable across operations and supply chains.

### Disadvantages:

- Low specificity and accuracy since it uses generalized emission factors.

## 2. Average Data Method (Physical Unit)

This method uses **primary activity data** such as the mass or quantity of purchased products, combined with secondary emission factors that provide average emissions per unit of the product (e.g., per kilogram or liter). This approach is more specific than the spend-based method but still relies on industry averages for emission factors\[4].

### Advantages:

- More accurate than spend-based methods when physical quantities are known.

### Disadvantages:

- Still relies on secondary data, which may not reflect the actual carbon intensity of specific suppliers.

## 3. Supplier-Specific Method

This method involves gathering **primary data** directly from suppliers, including their specific activity data (e.g., production volumes) and emission factors. This is considered one of the most accurate methods since it uses real-world data from suppliers rather than relying on averages\[4].

### Advantages:

- High specificity and accuracy.
- Reflects actual emissions from specific suppliers.

### Disadvantages:

- Time-consuming and resource-intensive to collect supplier-specific data.
- Requires strong collaboration with suppliers.

## 4. Hybrid Method

The hybrid method combines elements of both supplier-specific data and secondary data to fill gaps where primary data is unavailable. For example, a company might use supplier-specific data for certain key products while relying on industry averages for others\[4].

### Advantages:

- Balances specificity with practicality by using primary data where available.

### Disadvantages:

- Can lead to inaccuracies if not carefully managed, especially when combining different types of data sources.

## 5. Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs)

Some companies use **Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs)**, which provide detailed information on the environmental impact of a product throughout its entire life cycle—from raw material extraction to disposal. LCAs can be used to estimate Scope 3 emissions for purchased goods and services by evaluating their full environmental footprint\[3].

### Advantages:

- Provides comprehensive insights into product-level emissions.

### Disadvantages:

- LCAs are resource-intensive and may not be available for all products.

## 6. Use of Secondary Data Sources

When primary data is unavailable, companies often rely on secondary sources such as government statistics, public databases, or industry averages to estimate Scope 3 emissions. These sources provide broad estimates but are less accurate than primary data\[3].

### Advantages:

- Useful for filling gaps where primary data is unavailable.

### Disadvantages:

- Lower accuracy compared to methods using primary data.

## 7. Multi-Model Approach

Some companies employ a combination of different models depending on the category of Scope 3 emissions they are calculating (e.g., upstream vs downstream). This approach allows companies to tailor their estimation methods based on the availability and quality of data for each category\[1].

### Advantages:

- Flexible approach that can improve accuracy by using the best available method for each category.

### Disadvantages:

- Complex to manage multiple models simultaneously.

## Conclusion

Companies typically use a combination of these methods depending on the availability of primary data, the importance of specific Scope 3 categories, and the resources they can allocate toward collecting accurate information. While supplier-specific methods offer the highest accuracy, many companies start with simpler approaches like spend-based or average-data methods and gradually improve their reporting as better data becomes available over time\[1]\[2]\[4].
