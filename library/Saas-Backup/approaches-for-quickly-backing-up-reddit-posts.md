If you're looking for a **quick and reliable workflow** to back up your Reddit posts, here's a streamlined approach using more lightweight tools that balance simplicity and ease of use compared to a GitHub-based workflow. This will allow you to **automate backups** or easily store them without much manual effort:

### 1. **Markdown Files and Local Storage**
   - **What to use**: Instead of GitHub, use a **local Markdown editor** (like **Obsidian**, **Typora**, or even a plain text editor) to write and store your Reddit posts.
   - **Why it works**: Markdown is simple, lightweight, and ideal for text formatting. Writing your post in Markdown before posting allows you to **format your post as it would appear on Reddit**. Then, you can save the file locally for backup purposes.
   - **Bonus**: Markdown editors like Obsidian allow you to set up folders, tags, and cross-links, making it easy to organize and retrieve posts.
   
   **Workflow**:
   1. **Write in a Markdown editor**.
   2. Copy the Markdown and paste it into Reddit.
   3. Save the file to a local folder (you can set up one specifically for Reddit posts).

### 2. **Zapier or IFTTT for Automated Backups**
   - **What to use**: You can set up **Zapier** or **IFTTT** to automatically back up your Reddit posts to **Google Drive**, **Dropbox**, or other cloud services.
   - **Why it works**: This eliminates manual backup steps by automatically saving your posts whenever they go live on Reddit.
   - **Workflow**:
     1. Set up a **Zap** or **IFTTT rule** that triggers whenever you post on Reddit.
     2. The tool will automatically save the post text (and possibly metadata like date or subreddit) to your chosen cloud storage in text or Markdown format.

### 3. **Save to a Notion Database**
   - **What to use**: If you're already using **Notion** for organizing your thoughts, you can easily save your Reddit posts in a **Notion database**.
   - **Why it works**: Notion allows you to organize text content in an easily searchable way, with tags, tables, and filters.
   - **Workflow**:
     1. Create a new **Notion database** for Reddit posts.
     2. For each post, copy and paste it into a new page within the database.
     3. Use tags or properties to track things like subreddit, date, or post status (whether it’s been posted, deleted, etc.).

### 4. **Reddit Enhancement Suite (RES)**
   - **What to use**: **Reddit Enhancement Suite (RES)** is a popular browser extension for Reddit that provides many additional features, including the ability to **draft and save posts locally** before submission.
   - **Why it works**: With RES, you can draft and save posts locally while still in the browser, and later post them when you're ready. This helps maintain backups of posts as you work on them.
   - **Workflow**:
     1. Use RES to draft your post and save it.
     2. Post it when you're ready.
     3. Backup your draft by copying it to local storage or a cloud folder.

### 5. **Simple Local Script Using Bash (If You're Comfortable With Scripting)**
   - **What to use**: A **Bash script** that can be run before you post on Reddit to automatically save the content to a specific directory.
   - **Why it works**: For users comfortable with Bash, this workflow is as simple as running a command before posting.
   - **Workflow**:
     1. Write your post in a text file.
     2. Run a simple Bash script to save the file to a dedicated "Reddit backups" directory with a timestamped filename.

     Example Bash script:
     ```bash
     #!/bin/bash
     # Script to save Reddit post
     mkdir -p ~/reddit-backups
     timestamp=$(date +"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S")
     cp "$1" ~/reddit-backups/reddit_post_$timestamp.txt
     echo "Reddit post saved at ~/reddit-backups/reddit_post_$timestamp.txt"
     ```

### 6. **Use a Browser Extension Like "Draftback"**
   - **What to use**: Browser extensions like **Draftback** or **Lazarus** can automatically save drafts of anything you type online.
   - **Why it works**: These extensions work in the background, capturing everything you type, even if it’s deleted from the webpage. If your post is removed or accidentally deleted, you can easily retrieve it.
   - **Workflow**:
     1. Install the browser extension.
     2. As you type your post, it will save automatically in case of a deletion or mistake.
     3. Recover the draft if needed by accessing the extension’s saved drafts.

### Conclusion:
For ease of use, I recommend combining **Markdown + Notion** or **Markdown + Local Storage** for manual workflows, or setting up **IFTTT** for automatic backups. These approaches strike a balance between flexibility and simplicity, allowing you to write freely and still have reliable backups for your Reddit posts.
