# Notes

Please explain how note management systems such as Obsidian can be helpful for people like me with ADHD who have LOTS of ideas and lots of curiosity but ... sometimes a hard time keeping it organised!

# Outputs

Note management systems like **Obsidian** can be incredibly helpful for individuals with **ADHD**, particularly those who have lots of **ideas** and **curiosity**, but sometimes struggle with **organization** and **prioritization**. Here's how tools like Obsidian can address some of the unique challenges that come with ADHD:

### 1. **Capture Ideas Quickly (Brain Dump)**
   - People with ADHD often have lots of ideas flowing all the time, and it’s crucial to **capture them before they’re lost**. Obsidian offers a way to do this with its **quick capture feature**. You can use a hotkey to quickly open a note, jot down your idea, and save it without needing to navigate through multiple folders or files.
   - The **Daily Notes** plugin in Obsidian is also useful for quickly capturing thoughts or events each day. This habit can help ensure ideas are not lost in the whirlwind of thoughts.

### 2. **Linking Related Thoughts (Non-Linear Thinking)**
   - One of the most powerful features of Obsidian is its **bi-directional linking**. Individuals with ADHD tend to think **non-linearly** and often see connections between seemingly unrelated concepts. Obsidian’s ability to **link notes** helps replicate this web-like thinking structure by allowing you to **connect ideas across different notes**, creating a **network** rather than rigid folders.
   - The **Graph View** in Obsidian is also helpful for visualizing these connections. It allows you to see how various ideas link together, which can be especially helpful for people with ADHD who often benefit from seeing **big-picture context**.

### 3. **Dealing with Hyperfocus (Flexible Organization)**
   - **Hyperfocus** can be both a superpower and a challenge for those with ADHD. Obsidian’s **tags** and **folders** allow you to organize information in a flexible way that doesn’t force you into rigid categories. You can tag your notes based on themes or projects, allowing you to easily switch from one hyperfocus area to another while still keeping information accessible.
   - The **tag pane** and **search feature** help in quickly accessing related ideas, ensuring that you can dive deep into a topic without getting bogged down by how to find everything.

### 4. **Managing Distractions (Reducing Clutter)**
   - Tools like Obsidian allow you to create a **minimalistic workspace** that can help reduce distractions. You can customize the interface, hide unnecessary panes, and focus solely on writing or reading, which can help minimize **overstimulation**—a common problem for those with ADHD.
   - The **Focus Mode** in the editor helps block out distractions by hiding interface elements, which helps people with ADHD who need fewer distractions to maintain their attention on a task.

### 5. **Breaking Down Complex Projects (Atomic Notes)**
   - People with ADHD often find it overwhelming to work with large, complex documents or projects. Obsidian's approach to **atomic notes**—where you create smaller, manageable notes that contain a single idea or concept—makes it easier to break down big projects into **bite-sized chunks**.
   - You can then **link these atomic notes together** to form a cohesive overview. This modular approach can help keep you motivated by allowing you to focus on completing small, manageable pieces rather than getting overwhelmed by the bigger picture.

### 6. **Rediscovery and Prompted Recall (Periodic Reviews)**
   - With ADHD, it’s easy to forget ideas that were captured a while ago, even if they were important. Obsidian allows you to set up **periodic reviews** using plugins like the **Review Plugin**. You can revisit older notes periodically to refresh your memory and make connections with new ideas.
   - The **random note feature** also encourages rediscovery. It helps surface notes you might have forgotten about, ensuring valuable insights don’t get buried.

### 7. **Structure That’s Not Overbearing**
   - People with ADHD often struggle with tools that impose **strict organizational hierarchies**. Obsidian is **non-linear** and allows you to decide on the structure that best suits your needs—whether it's using folders, tags, or just links between notes. This flexibility reduces the cognitive load associated with forcing information into predefined categories.
   - You can create **multiple entry points** into your notes, allowing you to retrieve information in a way that matches how your mind associates it, which is particularly helpful for those whose brains tend to make spontaneous, creative connections.

### 8. **Visual Thinking (Mind Maps)**
   - The **Graph View** in Obsidian is especially useful for people with ADHD because it provides a **visual representation** of how notes are interconnected, similar to a **mind map**. This visual approach can help you see relationships between ideas more clearly and organize your thoughts in a way that makes sense without having to follow a rigid, linear structure.
   - This helps in **recognizing patterns**, understanding where gaps in knowledge exist, and deciding where to focus your attention next.

### 9. **Markdown for Low Friction Writing**
   - Obsidian uses **Markdown**, which is a lightweight way to format notes. This reduces the friction of formatting content and makes it easy to write down thoughts without being bogged down by formatting decisions. Markdown is also widely compatible, meaning your notes can be easily exported or shared without losing their structure.
   
### Example Plugins for ADHD Support:
- **Daily Notes**: Helps maintain a habit of journaling or capturing ideas every day.
- **Periodic Notes**: Allows you to set reminders to revisit and build on older ideas.
- **Kanban Plugin**: Great for visually managing projects and breaking tasks into smaller steps.
- **Templater**: Useful for creating consistent note templates to reduce decision fatigue when starting a new note.

### Summary
**Obsidian** is beneficial for people with **ADHD** because it offers:
- A **quick capture** system for incoming ideas.
- The ability to **link and visualize relationships** between notes, supporting non-linear thinking.
- A **flexible, clutter-free organization** approach that reduces overwhelm.
- Tools like **tags**, **folders**, and **graph view** to help organize and revisit thoughts in an intuitive way.

These features help leverage curiosity while reducing the friction associated with capturing and organizing lots of ideas, making it easier to manage creativity without becoming overwhelmed by it. If you’d like any specific guidance on setting up Obsidian or plugins for your needs, let me know!

# Input

Capturing fleeting ideas is indeed very important to me. Can you suggest some workflows? And other optimisations I can make based upon what you suggested above?

# Output

To help **capture fleeting ideas** and manage them effectively in **Obsidian**, here are some **workflows** and **optimizations** that you can implement. These workflows will help ensure that ideas are quickly captured, organized intuitively, and are easily accessible when needed.

### 1. **Quick Capture Workflow**
   - **Mobile + Desktop Sync**:
     - Install **Obsidian Mobile** on your phone. Use it to jot down ideas on the go. The advantage here is that you’ll always have access to Obsidian, ensuring you can capture thoughts whenever inspiration strikes.
     - Sync notes using **Obsidian Sync** or an alternative like **Syncthing** or **Dropbox**. This way, ideas captured on your phone are immediately available on your desktop, making it easy to expand on them later.
   - **Daily Notes for Brain Dumps**:
     - Set up **Daily Notes** to capture fleeting thoughts. You can assign a hotkey for **Daily Note creation**, making it easy to open and write whatever idea comes to mind. These notes serve as a sort of "inbox" for all spontaneous thoughts.
     - Consider adding a template to your **Daily Notes** that includes sections like "Fleeting Ideas" or "Quick Thoughts," which helps organize entries within the day.

### 2. **Hotkey-Based Quick Capture**
   - **Global Capture Hotkey**:
     - Configure a global hotkey using a tool like **Autokey** (for Linux) or **AutoHotkey** (for Windows) to open a new note in Obsidian instantly, regardless of what application you’re working in. This way, you can quickly jump into Obsidian and capture fleeting thoughts without breaking your workflow.
   - **Templater Plugin**:
     - Use the **Templater** plugin to create a quick entry template. For example, you can set up a template that auto-fills the title with the current timestamp and creates placeholders for “Idea” and “Next Action,” making it faster to log and expand on ideas.

### 3. **Voice Capture Integration**
   - **Speech to Text**:
     - Use your phone’s **voice-to-text feature** or a tool like **Google Keep** to capture voice notes and sync them into Obsidian. Tools like **Tasker** (Android) can automate sending voice transcriptions into Obsidian via markdown files, ensuring even ideas captured when you can't type get stored in your note system.
   - **Voice Note Conversion**:
     - You could record voice notes and transcribe them using **Obsidian plugins** like **Audio Recorder** or external tools like **Otter.ai**. This ensures you don’t miss any details of ideas that come when typing isn’t feasible.

### 4. **Inbox Folder System**
   - **Designate an Inbox Folder**:
     - Create a dedicated **Inbox folder** where you can quickly save new notes and ideas without thinking too much about categorization. Every time you have a new idea, drop it into this folder first. This allows you to separate **capture** from **organizing**—making the initial process faster.
   - **Weekly Review**:
     - At the end of the week, spend some time reviewing your **Inbox folder** and categorizing the notes. You can tag them, move them to relevant folders, or link them to other notes. This structured weekly review helps ensure that your notes are always up-to-date without slowing down the initial capture.

### 5. **Link Fleeting Notes to Related Content**
   - **Bi-Directional Linking**:
     - When you capture an idea, think about what other notes or projects it relates to, and **link** it to those notes. For example, if a new idea relates to a project or goal, use **Wiki-style links** to connect the idea to other relevant notes.
   - **Link to Contextualize**:
     - During the weekly review, consider how your fleeting ideas connect to existing notes. Linking fleeting notes to ongoing projects or thematic notes helps you build a **network of knowledge**, making it easy to revisit and expand on ideas at the right time.

### 6. **Use Tags for Prioritization and Retrieval**
   - **Tag Fleeting Ideas with Context Tags**:
     - Use **tags** to help categorize the nature of the fleeting idea. For example, use `#idea`, `#inspiration`, or `#research` to label different kinds of thoughts. Tags make it easy to retrieve related content later on.
   - **Task and Priority Tags**:
     - If a fleeting idea has an associated action, you can add tags like `#todo` or `#priority`. Later, you can pull up all notes tagged with `#todo` to get a clear list of things to act on.

### 7. **Periodic Rediscovery**
   - **Random Note Plugin**:
     - Use the **Random Note Plugin** to regularly surface older fleeting notes. ADHD often involves hyperfocus on new ideas, but older ideas can also be valuable. Randomly reviewing past notes helps refresh your memory on previously captured thoughts and ensures nothing is forgotten.
   - **Zettelkasten Linking**:
     - Consider using a **Zettelkasten** approach to make connections between fleeting ideas. By constantly linking new ideas to existing knowledge, you build a **web** of interconnected thoughts, which makes retrieval and recall easier.

### 8. **Atomic Note Workflow**
   - **Keep Notes Atomic**:
     - When capturing a fleeting idea, make it **atomic**—i.e., keep it about one idea per note. This makes it easy to find and link ideas later. The goal here is to keep notes small and focused, so when it comes to organizing them, you can easily link or group them without feeling overwhelmed.
   - **Template for Fleeting Notes**:
     - Create a **note template** for capturing fleeting ideas. For example:
       ```
       ---
       Created: {{date}}
       Tags: #fleeting #idea
       ---
       **Summary**:
       {{idea}}

       **Next Steps**:
       - [ ] Expand on the idea
       - [ ] Link to relevant notes
       ```
     - This template reduces cognitive load and ensures that every fleeting idea has a consistent format that you can easily process during a review.

### 9. **Kanban for Prioritization**
   - Use the **Kanban Plugin** to manage ideas you capture into action. Each fleeting idea can be represented as a **card** on your Kanban board. The Kanban board allows you to visually organize and prioritize ideas:
     - **To-Explore**, **In-Progress**, and **Explored** lanes can help in organizing ideas that you want to dive deeper into when time permits.
   - The visual aspect of a Kanban board can also be very ADHD-friendly, offering clarity on what’s most important.

### 10. **Daily Highlights and Evening Review**
   - **Morning Capture Ritual**:
     - Set aside 10-15 minutes each morning to **brain dump** all your thoughts. Capture everything in a new Daily Note. This ritual helps externalize your thoughts, allowing you to clear your mind before diving into focused work.
   - **Evening Review Ritual**:
     - Spend 5-10 minutes each evening to **review the Daily Note**. Identify what’s important, link it to other notes, or tag it for future reference.

### Summary
By creating a **quick capture system**, linking ideas effectively, organizing with **tags and folders**, and using **regular review practices**, Obsidian can become a valuable tool to help manage your ADHD-driven creativity and curiosity. These workflows and optimizations are designed to:
- **Minimize cognitive overload** during idea capture.
- **Maximize retrieval** through tagging, linking, and visual organization.
- **Leverage regular reviews** to ensure ideas are processed and used, rather than forgotten.
