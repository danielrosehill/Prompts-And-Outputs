Yes, it is technically possible to achieve close to **99% blue light blocking**, though itâ€™s often specific to certain ranges within the blue light spectrum rather than a complete cutoff of all blue light wavelengths. Glasses that claim to block 99% of blue light typically target specific wavelengths within the **400-500 nm** range, especially focusing on **450-480 nm**, which is known to be most disruptive to sleep and can trigger eye strain and migraines.

Here are some common features and limitations of high-percentage blue light blocking:

1. **Very High Blue Light Filtering Glasses (99%)**:
   - Glasses with **amber or red tints** can block 99% of blue light, especially within the **400-500 nm** range.
   - FL-41 lenses, commonly used for migraine relief, block a high percentage of light around **480-520 nm**, effectively filtering out blue-green light while allowing other wavelengths through.
   - These lenses often have a noticeable amber, orange, or red hue, which heavily impacts color perception and can make them less suitable for activities that require accurate color vision.

2. **UV and Specific Wavelength Filtering**:
   - Many lenses, particularly FL-41 and similar tints, aim to filter out specific ranges of blue light without completely blocking all visible blue light. These lenses can block the most irritating portions of the spectrum while maintaining some level of natural color visibility.

3. **Trade-offs of 99% Filtering**:
   - High blue light blocking lenses with deep tints (amber or red) are highly effective for reducing blue light exposure but can alter color perception significantly, making them best suited for evening or therapeutic use rather than for activities that require accurate color differentiation.
   - Full blue light blocking lenses (99% or more) are often recommended for people with extreme light sensitivity, sleep disorders, or conditions like migraines that are exacerbated by blue light exposure.

### Practical Considerations:
For general use, many users find that blocking around 30-60% of blue light is a good balance, as it reduces eye strain without heavily tinting vision. Glasses with 99% blue light blocking are most beneficial for specific therapeutic uses or evening wear to minimize blue light exposure before sleep. 

In sum, full 99% blue light blocking is achievable, but it is typically applied to specific wavelengths and often comes with a strong tint that may affect usability for all-day wear.
