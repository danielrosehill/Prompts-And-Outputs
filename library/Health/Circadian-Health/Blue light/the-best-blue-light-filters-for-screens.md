While most blue light filters are designed to block a significant portion of blue light (usually around 30–60%), very few block close to **100%** of blue light, especially in the **400–500 nm** range, which is considered the most harmful to eye health. Here are some options that offer **maximum blue light blocking** or **extreme reductions**:

### 1. **Ocushield Blue Light Filters**
   - **Ocushield** offers high-performance filters that block up to **90%** of harmful blue light. These filters are developed by optometrists and are designed to protect your eyes while maintaining screen clarity. Ocushield also offers **blue light blocking screen protectors** for both monitors and laptops.
   - **Pros**: High reduction in blue light with good screen clarity.
   - **Cons**: Does not block 100% of blue light, and it may be hard to find a perfect fit for some screen sizes.

### 2. **VistaProtect Blue Light Blocking Filters**
   - **VistaProtect** produces filters that block about **99% of blue light** in the **most harmful range** (380–450 nm). These filters also reduce glare and reflection, offering significant eye comfort for long periods of screen use.
   - **Pros**: Near-complete blue light blocking in the harmful range.
   - **Cons**: The screen may appear slightly warmer due to the strong blue light reduction, which could affect color perception for tasks like graphic design.

### 3. **Blue Light Blocking Glasses**
   - For almost **100% blue light blocking**, **blue light blocking glasses** might be a more effective option. Brands like **Gunnar Optiks** and **J+S Vision** offer lenses that block around **90–99%** of blue light, which can complement or exceed the capabilities of screen filters.
   - **Pros**: Flexible and portable, protects across different screens.
   - **Cons**: Must be worn constantly, rather than filtering the screen itself.

### 4. **FL-41 Tinted Glasses**
   - While not specifically for blue light, **FL-41 tinted lenses** block both blue and green light, and they are recommended for people with extreme light sensitivity or those prone to migraines. Paired with blue light software or a filter, they can help block close to **100%** of blue light.
   - **Pros**: Great for individuals with sensitivity or migraines.
   - **Cons**: Not a screen filter—must be worn as glasses.

### 5. **Custom High-Blocking Filters**
   - Some companies offer **custom-made blue light blocking filters**, which can block a very high percentage (up to **95–99%**) of blue light. These filters may slightly tint the screen yellow, as they aim to block almost all blue light from your display. Brands like **IRIS** and **LowBlueLights** offer such options.
   - **Pros**: Extreme reduction of blue light.
   - **Cons**: Colors on the screen may be altered due to the aggressive filtering.

### 6. **Software Solutions for Further Reduction**
   - For users who cannot find a 100% blue light filter, software tools like **Redshift** or **f.lux** can be used to adjust screen color temperature to reduce blue light emissions further.
   - **Pros**: Dynamic control based on time of day.
   - **Cons**: Does not physically block all blue light; rather, it adjusts the display's color balance.

### Important Considerations:
- **Color Distortion**: Higher levels of blue light blocking often result in screens appearing yellow or warmer, which can affect color accuracy for tasks such as photo editing or graphic design.
- **Eye Comfort**: Even filters that block 90–99% of blue light can make a huge difference in reducing eye strain, especially if used in combination with software solutions and regular breaks from the screen.

If you are looking for the **most effective blue light reduction**, **VistaProtect** or **custom filters** paired with **blue light blocking glasses** might be the best way to approach nearly 100% blue light blocking. Let me know if you'd like help finding the right product for your monitor!
