You asked for a recommendation for glasses suitable for someone with heightened sensitivity, which can be worn all day, both when using a computer and otherwise, to create a more mellow experience.

For all-day wear and managing sensitivity to light, I would suggest considering tinted lenses that reduce glare and soften the visual experience. Here are some options:

1. FL-41 Glasses: These lenses are often recommended for people with light sensitivity (photophobia), migraines, and eye strain. The subtle rose or amber tint filters out harsh blue and green light, which can be overstimulating. Theyâ€™re useful both for screen time and general light sensitivity.


2. Blue-Light Blocking Glasses: Even though you want something beyond just computer use, blue-light blocking glasses can be useful for all-day wear. Some of these come with a light amber tint that can reduce overall brightness and glare, making the world feel softer without being too dark. Look for low-intensity filters that can be used indoors and outdoors.


3. Transition Lenses: If you spend time both indoors and outdoors, you might want to try transition (photochromic) lenses. These darken in response to sunlight and remain clear indoors. This offers flexibility to adapt to different lighting environments without needing to swap glasses.


4. Polarized Lenses: Polarized lenses reduce glare from reflective surfaces, such as roads, water, or even bright indoor lights. While they are more commonly used outdoors, some brands offer lighter polarization that can be suitable for indoor use as well.


5. Yellow or Amber Tints: If your sensitivity includes discomfort with fluorescent or LED lighting, yellow or amber-tinted glasses can soften the light and provide a more mellow, warmer visual experience. These tints are often subtle enough for all-day wear.



For comfort and protection in various settings, you might consider a combination of FL-41 lenses or light blue-light blockers with polarization, as these will cover a range of lighting conditions without being overly dark.
