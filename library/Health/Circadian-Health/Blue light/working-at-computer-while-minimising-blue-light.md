# Prompt

You mention that blue light is a bad idea but I really enjoy working on my tech projects. Is there any way to use a computer that effectively eliminates blue light exposure? Could you wear blue light glasses while using a computer?

# Output

Yes, you can still enjoy working on your tech projects while minimizing blue light exposure. Here are some effective strategies to reduce blue light impact:

### 1. **Blue Light Glasses**
   - **Wear Blue Light Blocking Glasses:** These glasses are designed to filter out the blue light emitted from screens, making them an excellent option for reducing eye strain and helping maintain your sleep cycle. You can wear these glasses while working on your computer, especially in the evening or at night.

### 2. **Screen Filters**
   - **Use Blue Light Screen Filters:** Physical screen protectors or filters that block blue light are available for most devices. These filters can be attached to your monitor or laptop screen to reduce blue light exposure.

### 3. **Software Solutions**
   - **Night Mode or Blue Light Filters:** Many operating systems and devices have built-in settings (like Night Shift on macOS, Night Light on Windows, or similar features on Android and iOS) that reduce blue light by warming the color temperature of the screen.
   - **F.lux:** This is a free software that automatically adjusts your screen’s color temperature according to the time of day, reducing blue light in the evening.

### 4. **Monitor Settings**
   - **Adjust Display Settings:** Some monitors have built-in blue light filters or “Eye Care” modes that can be enabled to reduce blue light emission.

### 5. **Use Warm Light**
   - **Ambient Lighting:** Consider using warm-colored ambient lighting in your workspace. Avoid bright, cool-toned lights during the evening, as these can increase blue light exposure.

### 6. **Take Breaks**
   - **Follow the 20-20-20 Rule:** For every 20 minutes of screen time, look at something 20 feet away for at least 20 seconds to reduce eye strain.

By combining blue light glasses with these other strategies, you can continue working on your tech projects while effectively minimizing blue light exposure, which should help you maintain better sleep quality during your transition off Seroquel.## Extracted Prompts
