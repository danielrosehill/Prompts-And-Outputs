Summary: You asked if there is a specific color of light that's supposed to be more relaxing, noting that you heard red was good but also mentioned that it can lead to irritability.

In terms of light colors and their effects on mood and relaxation:

Relaxing Colors of Light:

1. Blue Light: Often considered calming, blue light can create a tranquil atmosphere. It is associated with reducing stress and promoting a sense of peace. Some studies suggest it can help lower heart rates and support better sleep quality.


2. Green Light: This color is also calming and is associated with nature. It can create a balanced and restful environment, making it a good option for relaxation.


3. Soft White or Warm Light: These hues mimic natural sunlight and are generally considered soothing. They can create a cozy atmosphere without being harsh or overly stimulating.



Red Light:

While red light can be used in specific contexts (like for certain therapeutic purposes), it can also be overstimulating for some individuals, particularly in bright or intense forms. It has been associated with alertness and can evoke feelings of warmth but may lead to irritability if overused or experienced in high intensity.

Recommendations:

For a relaxing environment, try using soft blue or green lights, or warm white lighting in your spaces. Additionally, consider dimming lights during the evening to create a calming atmosphere conducive to relaxation and sleep. Always pay attention to how different colors of light affect you personally, as sensory responses can vary widely from person to person.
