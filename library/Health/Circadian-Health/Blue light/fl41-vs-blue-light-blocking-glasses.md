You asked about how much less blue light FL-41 lenses block compared to blue light blocking glasses. Here’s a comparison:

FL-41 Lenses:

Purpose: FL-41 is a rose or amber tint designed to filter out certain wavelengths of light, particularly those that can trigger migraines, eye strain, or photophobia (light sensitivity). They specifically reduce light in the green-blue spectrum but do not focus solely on blue light.

Blue Light Blocking: FL-41 lenses typically block around 20-40% of blue light (wavelengths between 400–500 nm), depending on the specific manufacturer and lens version. Their main goal is to reduce overall visual discomfort, not just blue light.


Blue Light Blocking Glasses:

Purpose: These glasses are designed specifically to filter blue light, usually focusing on wavelengths around 400–450 nm (the high-energy visible light from screens).

Blue Light Blocking: Depending on the strength of the lenses, blue light-blocking glasses can block between 50-100% of blue light in the 400–450 nm range. Some specialized versions block up to 99% of this blue light, especially those designed for nighttime use.


Comparison:

FL-41 lenses block significantly less blue light compared to dedicated blue light-blocking glasses. While FL-41 lenses filter a broader spectrum of light and aim to reduce discomfort from different light sources, blue light-blocking glasses specifically target and block a higher percentage of blue light, making them more effective for screen-related eye strain or blue light sensitivity.


If your primary concern is blue light, blue light-blocking glasses offer much stronger protection. However, if you're more focused on reducing overall discomfort from light sensitivity or migraines, FL-41 lenses might be more suitable.
