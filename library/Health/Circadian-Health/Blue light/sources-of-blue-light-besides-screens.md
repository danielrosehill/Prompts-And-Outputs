You asked for examples of blue light sources we are regularly exposed to besides LED screens.

Here are a few common sources of blue light in our daily environments:

1. Sunlight: The largest source of blue light comes from natural sunlight, which contains all colors of visible light, including blue.


2. LED and fluorescent lighting: Many indoor light sources, like LED bulbs and fluorescent lights, emit significant amounts of blue light. These are commonly found in homes, offices, and public spaces.


3. Smartphone and tablet displays: Although similar to LED screens, the blue light from smaller personal devices like smartphones and tablets is worth mentioning separately because of how frequently we use them.


4. Television screens: Modern flat-screen TVs, especially those using LED technology, also emit blue light, especially when watched in dim lighting.


5. Vehicle headlights: Many modern cars use LED or HID (high-intensity discharge) headlights, which produce more blue light than traditional halogen headlights.



These sources contribute to our regular exposure to blue light, even outside of using computer or phone screens.
