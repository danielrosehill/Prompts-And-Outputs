**Summary of the prompt:** You are asking whether clear lens glasses can effectively block blue light.

---

Yes, clear lens glasses can be effective at blocking blue light, though their effectiveness may be limited compared to glasses with specialized yellow or amber tints. Many modern blue light filtering glasses are designed with coatings or filters embedded into clear lenses that block a percentage of blue light, typically in the range of 10-30%. These lenses are designed for individuals who want protection from blue light without the color distortion caused by tinted lenses.

### How Clear Lenses Block Blue Light:
- **Coatings**: Clear lenses often have a special anti-reflective coating that selectively blocks blue light in the harmful wavelengths (generally between 400-450 nm).
- **Invisible Filters**: Some manufacturers embed blue light filters into the lens material itself, allowing the lenses to remain clear while offering protection.

### Factors to Consider:
- **Level of Protection**: Clear lenses typically block a portion of blue light but are not as effective as tinted lenses, which can block more than 90% of blue light.
- **Purpose**: If you're primarily concerned with blocking blue light from screens during daytime use, clear lenses may be sufficient. However, for people sensitive to blue light at night or experiencing severe digital eye strain, tinted lenses offer more comprehensive protection.

### Conclusion:
Clear lens glasses can be effective at reducing exposure to blue light, but they may not block as much as tinted alternatives. If you prefer clear lenses for aesthetic reasons or because you donâ€™t want color distortion, ensure that the lenses have a good blue light blocking coating and understand their limitations.
