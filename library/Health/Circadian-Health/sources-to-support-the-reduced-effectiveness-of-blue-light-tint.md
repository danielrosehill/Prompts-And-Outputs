Your skepticism about the clear lenses blocking the "maximum" amount of blue light is justified. Clear blue light filtering lenses typically block a percentage of blue light, usually around **20-40%** of the most harmful blue-violet light (in the 400-450 nm range). While they provide some protection, they don't block as much blue light as lenses with a yellow or amber tint, which can block up to **60-90%** of blue light, including the blue-turquoise light that affects sleep cycles【34†source】【35†source】.

Clear lenses are designed for people who want minimal color distortion while still reducing eye strain from digital screens. However, the claim that they block the *maximum* amount of blue light is likely an overstatement, as the maximum blue light filtering is typically achieved with tinted lenses【36†source】.

If you're looking for maximum protection, especially for evening use when blue light impacts your sleep, you may need glasses with tinted lenses.
