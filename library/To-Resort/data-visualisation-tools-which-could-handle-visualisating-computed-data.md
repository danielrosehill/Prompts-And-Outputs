### Summary of your prompt:
You are asking which of the data visualization tools we've discussed are capable of combining multiple data sources (e.g., live financial data from an API and data from a local database) in a single visualization. Additionally, you want to know if any of these tools can handle logic, such as multiplying live API data by values from a local database and visualizing the calculated result.

### Tools Capable of Combining Data Sources:

1. **Apache Superset**:
   - **Combining Data Sources**: Superset supports combining multiple data sources through its SQL Lab and visualization features. You can connect to multiple databases and APIs simultaneously.
   - **Handling Logic**: Superset allows you to perform calculations (e.g., SQL queries) on data from different sources, including combining live API data with local database data. You could multiply values from an API by a number stored in a local database and visualize the result using calculated columns or SQL-based transformations.
   - **Strength**: Excellent for complex analytics and combining data sources with custom logic.

2. **Metabase**:
   - **Combining Data Sources**: Metabase supports multiple data sources, including SQL databases and APIs. You can connect to different databases and live data sources in the same instance.
   - **Handling Logic**: Metabase allows for combining data through custom queries and simple calculations. For more complex logic, such as multiplying values from an API by data in a local database, you would need to set up custom SQL queries that join the data sources together.
   - **Strength**: Good for basic to intermediate logic, especially if SQL-based transformations are sufficient.

3. **Grafana**:
   - **Combining Data Sources**: Grafana is highly capable of integrating multiple data sources, including time-series databases, SQL databases, APIs, and JSON data feeds. It supports multiple data panels on the same dashboard and can display data from different sources in a unified way.
   - **Handling Logic**: Grafana supports transformations, such as applying calculations to data from different sources, and merging API data with local data. You can perform basic math, such as multiplying or dividing values between sources, through built-in transformations and plugins.
   - **Strength**: Ideal for real-time visualizations with complex source combinations and transformations.

4. **Redash**:
   - **Combining Data Sources**: Redash allows querying multiple data sources, including SQL databases and APIs. However, it doesn't natively support combining data from different sources into a single query or visualization as easily as Superset or Grafana.
   - **Handling Logic**: Redash can handle some logic, but combining live API data with local database data would typically require handling this in the query layer or setting up a unified data source. You could potentially handle this by creating a view in the database that combines the external data with your local data.
   - **Strength**: Best suited for querying data sources separately rather than performing complex data logic across sources.

### Tools Less Capable of Combining Data Sources:
- **Grav, Hugo, Jekyll, Ghost**: These CMS options are focused on content management and don't have the capacity to perform data source integrations or logic by themselves. Any such logic would need to be handled by the visualization tool (e.g., Grafana, Superset) or in the data preparation layer before embedding the visualizations.

### Recommendation for Logic Across Data Sources:
- **Superset** and **Grafana** are your best options for handling the scenario you described. Both tools are capable of integrating live API data with local databases and performing calculations, including combining and transforming data across sources. 
  - **Superset** is more SQL-driven, so if you are comfortable with SQL, it provides a powerful environment for combining sources and applying logic.
  - **Grafana** offers a more visual interface for combining data from different sources and applying transformations, making it a strong choice for real-time visualizations with complex data integrations.
