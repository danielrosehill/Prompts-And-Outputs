# Prompt

I would like to run a report producing as much detail about the hardware installed in my fedora workstation 40 computer as possible. are there tools for this purpose?

# Output

Yes, there are several tools available in Fedora Workstation 40 that can provide detailed information about your hardware. Here's a comprehensive approach to gathering as much hardware information as possible:

1. lshw (Hardware Lister):
   This is one of the most comprehensive tools. Run it with sudo for full details:
   ```
   sudo lshw -html > hardware_report.html
   ```
   This will generate an HTML report with detailed information about your system hardware.

2. inxi:
   This tool provides a nice summary of system information:
   ```
   inxi -Fxz > inxi_report.txt
   ```

3. dmidecode:
   This tool provides detailed information about your system's hardware components:
   ```
   sudo dmidecode > dmidecode_report.txt
   ```

4. lspci:
   For PCI devices information:
   ```
   lspci -vv > lspci_report.txt
   ```

5. lsusb:
   For USB devices:
   ```
   lsusb -v > lsusb_report.txt
   ```

6. lscpu:
   For detailed CPU information:
   ```
   lscpu > lscpu_report.txt
   ```

7. free:
   For memory information:
   ```
   free -h > memory_report.txt
   ```

8. df:
   For disk space information:
   ```
   df -h > disk_space_report.txt
   ```

9. hwinfo:
   Another comprehensive hardware information tool:
   ```
   sudo hwinfo --all > hwinfo_report.txt
   ```

10. neofetch:
    For a quick system overview:
    ```
    neofetch > neofetch_report.txt
    ```

You can combine all these into a single script to generate a comprehensive report:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

mkdir hardware_report
cd hardware_report

sudo lshw -html > lshw_report.html
inxi -Fxz > inxi_report.txt
sudo dmidecode > dmidecode_report.txt
lspci -vv > lspci_report.txt
lsusb -v > lsusb_report.txt
lscpu > lscpu_report.txt
free -h > memory_report.txt
df -h > disk_space_report.txt
sudo hwinfo --all > hwinfo_report.txt
neofetch > neofetch_report.txt

echo "Hardware report generated in $(pwd)"
```

Save this script, make it executable with `chmod +x script_name.sh`, and run it with sudo. This will create a directory with various reports about your system's hardware.

Remember to install any missing tools using DNF:

```
sudo dnf install lshw inxi dmidecode pciutils usbutils hwinfo neofetch
```

This approach will give you a very comprehensive view of your Fedora Workstation 40's hardware configuration.
