# Prompt

Let's think about ways in which I could make my process of capturing GPT interactions in Obsidian a bit easier. There are two repetitive actions I would like to automate. Typing out "prompt" (which I do before capturing my prompt) and typing out "output" which I do before capturing an output. I prepend each with a hashtag to mark them as a heading in markdown. However sometimes my chats involve multiple prompts and outputs and so I order them sequentially. E.g. "prompt 2" "output". I'm writing these by hand and wish there were some way to automate this so I could take my mind off it. Do you have any ideas?

# Output

There are a few ways you can automate the process of labeling and numbering your "prompt" and "output" sections in Obsidian. Here are some ideas:

### 1. **Templater Plugin**
   - **Overview:** The Templater plugin in Obsidian allows you to create dynamic templates with scripts that can automate repetitive tasks.
   - **Implementation:**
     1. **Install Templater:** Install the Templater plugin from the Obsidian community plugins.
     2. **Create a Template:**
        - Create a template that automatically inserts a "prompt" and "output" section with sequential numbering. 
        - For example, you could create a template like this:
          ```markdown
          ## Prompt <% tp.user.prompt_count() %>

          ## Output <% tp.user.output_count() %>
          ```
        - In your Templater script settings, create custom scripts that increment a counter for `prompt_count` and `output_count` each time they are called.
     3. **Usage:** Use a hotkey or command to insert the template whenever you need to capture a new interaction. The counters will increment automatically.

### 2. **QuickAdd Plugin**
   - **Overview:** QuickAdd is another powerful Obsidian plugin that can be used to create custom commands for inserting text or templates.
   - **Implementation:**
     1. **Install QuickAdd:** Install QuickAdd from the Obsidian community plugins.
     2. **Create Custom Capture:**
        - Set up a custom capture in QuickAdd that inserts "prompt X" or "output X" with the appropriate numbering.
        - You can configure the capture to ask you whether it’s a "prompt" or "output" and automatically increment the numbering.
     3. **Usage:** Assign a hotkey to your custom capture command, making it easy to insert the correct heading with one keypress.

### 3. **Text Expander**
   - **Overview:** A text expander tool can automatically replace shortcuts with full text, including sequential numbers.
   - **Tools:** You could use a tool like **Espanso** (cross-platform) or **AutoKey** (Linux).
   - **Implementation:**
     1. **Install Text Expander:** Install Espanso or AutoKey on your system.
     2. **Create Shortcuts:**
        - Create a shortcut like `;p` that expands to `## Prompt X` and another like `;o` that expands to `## Output X`.
        - Use a script within the text expander to automatically increment the number each time the shortcut is used.
     3. **Usage:** Type the shortcut in Obsidian, and the text expander will replace it with the correct heading and number.

### 4. **Obsidian Macros Plugin**
   - **Overview:** The Macros plugin allows you to chain together multiple actions in Obsidian, which can be useful for automating repetitive text entries.
   - **Implementation:**
     1. **Install Macros:** Install the Macros plugin from the Obsidian community plugins.
     2. **Create a Macro:**
        - Set up a macro that inserts "prompt X" followed by "output X" and increments each time it's run.
        - You can configure this to run automatically or bind it to a hotkey.
     3. **Usage:** Trigger the macro whenever you start a new prompt-output pair.

### 5. **Custom Script or Plugin**
   - **Overview:** If you have some programming experience, you could create a custom script or Obsidian plugin to automate this process.
   - **Implementation:**
     1. **Write a Script:** Write a simple JavaScript or Python script that takes the current note and inserts "prompt X" and "output X" where you need them.
     2. **Integrate with Obsidian:** You could run this script from within Obsidian using the `Templater` or `QuickAdd` plugin, or by creating your own Obsidian plugin.
     3. **Usage:** Use a hotkey or command palette to run the script and insert your headings.

### Summary
The **Templater** and **QuickAdd** plugins are probably the easiest and most powerful ways to automate this directly within Obsidian, especially if you’re already using the platform extensively. **Text expanders** like Espanso or AutoKey are great if you prefer a solution that works across different applications, not just Obsidian.

By setting up one of these automations, you can reduce the manual effort involved in labeling your prompts and outputs, allowing you to focus more on capturing and organizing your knowledge.

# Prompt 2

Could I create keyboard bindings for "prompt" and "output" (the headings) and if so which do you suggest I use?

# Output 2

Yes, you can create keyboard bindings for inserting the "prompt" and "output" headings in Obsidian, making it easier to quickly add these sections to your notes. Here’s how you can do it, and some suggestions on which tools to use:

### 1. **Using Obsidian’s Built-in Hotkeys**
   - **Overview:** Obsidian allows you to set custom hotkeys for various commands, including inserting templates or running commands from plugins.
   - **Implementation:**
     1. **Create a Template:**
        - Create a template for "prompt" and "output" headings using the built-in Templates plugin or the Templater plugin.
        - Example template for "prompt":
          ```markdown
          ## Prompt
          ```
        - Example template for "output":
          ```markdown
          ## Output
          ```
     2. **Assign Hotkeys:**
        - Go to `Settings` > `Hotkeys`.
        - Assign a custom hotkey to the "Insert Template" command or directly to your custom template if you're using Templater.
        - For example, you might assign `Ctrl+Alt+P` for "Prompt" and `Ctrl+Alt+O` for "Output."
     3. **Usage:** Whenever you want to insert the headings, use the assigned hotkeys.

### 2. **Using the QuickAdd Plugin**
   - **Overview:** QuickAdd is a powerful plugin that allows you to create custom commands, which can include inserting text, running scripts, or executing complex actions.
   - **Implementation:**
     1. **Install QuickAdd:** Go to `Settings` > `Community Plugins`, search for QuickAdd, and install it.
     2. **Create a New Capture:**
        - Set up a new capture in QuickAdd to insert the "prompt" and "output" headings.
        - You can create separate captures for "Prompt" and "Output" or combine them with a prompt for sequential numbering.
     3. **Assign Hotkeys:**
        - In the QuickAdd settings, assign hotkeys to your captures, e.g., `Ctrl+Alt+P` for inserting a "Prompt" and `Ctrl+Alt+O` for "Output."
     4. **Usage:** Press the hotkeys to quickly insert the text into your notes.

### 3. **Using a Text Expander (Espanso or AutoKey)**
   - **Overview:** Text expanders like **Espanso** (cross-platform) or **AutoKey** (Linux) allow you to create shortcuts that expand into full text snippets.
   - **Implementation:**
     1. **Install Espanso or AutoKey:**
        - **Espanso:** Install via terminal:
          ```bash
          sudo dnf install espanso
          ```
        - **AutoKey:** Install via terminal:
          ```bash
          sudo dnf install autokey-gtk
          ```
     2. **Create Shortcuts:**
        - Set up a shortcut like `;p` to expand to `## Prompt`.
        - Set up a shortcut like `;o` to expand to `## Output`.
     3. **Usage:** Type `;p` or `;o` in Obsidian, and the text expander will automatically replace it with the full heading.

### 4. **Using Templater Plugin for Advanced Scripting**
   - **Overview:** Templater is a plugin that allows for more advanced templating, including dynamic content and scripting.
   - **Implementation:**
     1. **Install Templater:** Install it from the community plugins section.
     2. **Create Templates:** Set up templates for "prompt" and "output" headings.
     3. **Assign Hotkeys:** Use the Templater settings to bind these templates to hotkeys.
     4. **Usage:** Use the hotkeys to insert the heading at the cursor position.

### Recommendation
- **Obsidian’s Built-in Hotkeys**: If you prefer a native solution within Obsidian without installing additional plugins, using the built-in hotkey assignment for templates is a straightforward approach.
- **QuickAdd Plugin**: This is recommended if you want more control and flexibility over your text insertion, including sequential numbering or more complex actions.
- **Espanso or AutoKey**: Ideal if you want a solution that works across all applications, not just Obsidian, or if you prefer a lightweight, system-wide tool.

For most users, **QuickAdd** offers the best balance of power and simplicity, allowing you to automate more of your workflow within Obsidian.## Extracted Prompts
