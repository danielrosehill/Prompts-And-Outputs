# Prompt

How many concurrent users can you typical shared hosting plan support before throttling becomes an issue?

# Output

The number of concurrent users that a typical shared hosting plan can support before performance degradation or throttling becomes an issue depends on several factors, including the specific hosting provider, the resources allocated to the shared plan, and the nature of the website/application.

### Key Factors Affecting Concurrent Users on Shared Hosting:
1. **CPU and RAM Allocation**: Shared hosting plans often provide limited CPU and RAM resources. These are shared among multiple websites, so spikes in traffic on other sites can impact your performance.
2. **I/O Performance**: Disk read/write speeds, often shared among accounts, can become a bottleneck during high traffic or resource-intensive queries.
3. **Resource Limits**: Most shared hosting providers impose restrictions on processes, memory usage, and bandwidth. Exceeding these limits can trigger throttling.
4. **Type of Application**: A static website (HTML/CSS/JS) will handle far more concurrent users than a dynamic, database-driven application like **Grafana**, which requires constant querying and data processing.
5. **Caching**: Enabling caching (at the server level or through a CDN like Cloudflare) can significantly reduce the load and increase the number of concurrent users by serving cached content rather than hitting the server each time.

### General Estimates for Shared Hosting:
1. **Low-Tier Shared Hosting** (e.g., $3-$10/month plans):
   - **Estimated Concurrent Users**: 10-20 users
   - These plans typically throttle after a small number of concurrent users, especially if the users are requesting dynamic pages or dashboard views like Grafana.

2. **Mid-Tier Shared Hosting** (e.g., $10-$30/month plans):
   - **Estimated Concurrent Users**: 50-100 users
   - A shared hosting plan with more resources allocated (higher CPU/memory) and enhanced features like increased I/O or better caching may handle more concurrent users, but it's still limited. Anything beyond this could easily lead to performance degradation.

3. **High-Tier Shared Hosting** (e.g., $30+/month plans):
   - **Estimated Concurrent Users**: 100-200 users
   - Higher-tier shared hosting plans may support a moderate number of concurrent users, but performance can still degrade if your application is resource-intensive or if there's a significant traffic spike.

### Why Shared Hosting Isn't Ideal for Applications Like Grafana:
- **Resource Contention**: Shared hosting environments allocate resources to many customers on the same server. If one website suddenly experiences high traffic, it can lead to resource contention, slowing down your site.
- **CPU and Memory Limitations**: Even higher-tier shared hosting plans provide limited CPU and RAM, which is often insufficient for handling many concurrent users, especially for database-driven applications like Grafana.
- **Throttling**: Hosting providers can throttle your site’s performance if resource usage exceeds preset limits. This results in slow loading times or even temporary unavailability for users.

### Conclusion:

- **Concurrent Users on Shared Hosting**: A typical low-to-mid-tier shared hosting plan can support **10-50 concurrent users** before you experience throttling or slowdowns, especially for dynamic applications like Grafana.
  
For a more **scalable** solution that provides **elastic resources** and better **performance for public dashboards**, I would recommend cloud hosting solutions like **Vultr**, **Scaleway**, or **Linode**, where you have dedicated CPU and RAM resources with the ability to scale as needed.

If you’re serious about running a Grafana instance with a growing user base, **shared hosting is not recommended** due to its resource limitations and lack of scalability. Instead, a VPS or cloud-based solution would provide more reliability and control over resources, allowing you to scale effectively as traffic increases.
