# Prompt

Can you recommend the best backup approach that would allow for the system to be restored onto completely new hardware if required? What would be the optimal way to capture all the system configuration changes but allow it to be flexible enough to be set up on a new computer?

# Output

To prepare for the possibility of restoring your Fedora system onto completely new hardware, you'll want a backup approach that captures both your **data** and **system configuration** while ensuring **hardware independence**. Here's the best approach that would allow flexibility for such a restoration scenario:

### 1. **Full System Image Backup (Bare Metal Recovery)**

This is your safeguard for a complete system restore. A **bare metal backup** captures everything on your system, including the bootloader, system files, and data, allowing you to restore the system as-is on new hardware.

#### Tools:
- **Clonezilla**: Great for creating full system disk images that can be restored to different hardware.
- **Relax-and-Recover (ReaR)**: Specifically designed for disaster recovery and bare-metal backups. It creates a bootable rescue image and integrates with backup tools like `rsync` or `Bacula`.

### 2. **Configurable System Backup (for New Hardware)**

For flexibility in case the new hardware differs from your current setup, it's best to back up configurations separately so that you can restore them without being locked into the old hardware.

#### Tools:
- **`rsync`** or **`BorgBackup`**: Use these tools to backup the `/home` directory, application configurations in `/etc`, and custom scripts or system configurations.
- **`Timeshift`**: Useful for creating system snapshots. It can exclude device-specific information, making it easier to restore to a new machine.

### Steps to Achieve Flexibility

1. **Backup Home Directory**:
   - Your `/home` directory contains user data, application settings, and personal files. It’s crucial to ensure this is regularly backed up.
   - Use `rsync` or `BorgBackup` to backup the `/home` directory. 

   **Command Example:**
   ```bash
   rsync -aAXv /home /path/to/backup/location
   ```

2. **Backup System Configuration Files**:
   - You want to capture the core system configurations, typically found in `/etc`, custom scripts in `/usr/local/bin`, and cron jobs.
   - These settings should be backed up separately to ensure flexibility when restoring to a new machine.

   **Command Example:**
   ```bash
   rsync -aAXv /etc /usr/local/bin /path/to/backup/location
   ```

3. **Package List Backup**:
   - To ensure your software setup is easily replicated on a new machine, you should export a list of installed packages.

   **For DNF-based systems (Fedora)**:
   ```bash
   sudo dnf list installed > /path/to/backup/location/package_list.txt
   ```

   - This list will allow you to quickly reinstall the same packages on new hardware using the command:
   ```bash
   sudo dnf install $(cat package_list.txt)
   ```

4. **Backup Boot and EFI**:
   - Back up your EFI/boot partition separately. This will ensure that you can restore the boot configuration on new hardware, though you'll likely need to reinstall the bootloader.

   **Command Example:**
   ```bash
   rsync -aAXv /boot /path/to/backup/location
   ```

5. **Backup Partitions (for BTRFS Users)**:
   - Since you're using BTRFS, backing up your filesystem snapshots can be incredibly powerful. Use BTRFS tools to snapshot your system and backup those snapshots.

   **Command Example:**
   ```bash
   btrfs subvolume snapshot / /path/to/backup/snapshot
   rsync -aAXv /path/to/backup/snapshot /path/to/external/backup/location
   ```

6. **Automating Backups with Cron**:
   - Automate the process by scheduling these backup commands using cron jobs to ensure everything is backed up regularly.

   **Example Cron Job (Daily Backup)**:
   ```bash
   0 2 * * * /usr/bin/rsync -aAXv /home /etc /usr/local/bin /boot /path/to/backup/location
   ```

### 3. **Hardware Abstraction for Flexibility** (ReaR + New Kernel Setup)
To make your system adaptable to new hardware, you need a **modular approach** that avoids hardcoding hardware-specific drivers and configurations:

- **Use ReaR**: ReaR (Relax-and-Recover) is designed for bare metal recovery and disaster recovery. It allows you to create a bootable ISO image with all your system’s configuration files. When moving to new hardware, it detects the new system’s devices and loads the appropriate drivers. 

   **Steps to set up ReaR:**
   1. Install ReaR:
      ```bash
      sudo dnf install rear
      ```

   2. Configure ReaR for backup:
      Edit `/etc/rear/local.conf` and include:
      ```
      OUTPUT=ISO
      BACKUP=NETFS
      ```
      You can specify additional backup paths like `/home` or `/etc` in this file.

   3. Create the recovery image:
      ```bash
      sudo rear mkrescue
      ```

   4. In the event of hardware failure or new hardware, you can boot from the ISO, which will automatically adapt to the new system.

### 4. **Post-Restore Hardware Adaptation**

After restoring your system on new hardware, you may need to:
- **Reinstall Bootloader**: If the bootloader fails to boot after restoring to new hardware, use a live USB to boot and reinstall GRUB.
   ```bash
   sudo grub2-install /dev/sda
   sudo grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
   ```

- **Kernel Adjustments**: If the new hardware has different devices (e.g., network cards, graphics cards), make sure the necessary drivers are installed by using:
   ```bash
   sudo dnf update kernel
   sudo dnf install necessary-drivers
   ```

### Summary of the Optimal Approach:
1. **Daily/Weekly rsync or BorgBackup**: Incremental backups of your `/home`, `/etc`, and other critical data.
2. **Monthly Full Image Backup**: Clonezilla or ReaR to create full disk images that capture everything.
3. **Config Backups**: Store package lists and system configuration files for easy reinstallation.
4. **ReaR**: For hardware abstraction and easy disaster recovery onto new hardware.
5. **Snapshots**: Use BTRFS snapshots regularly for quick rollback and data integrity.

This approach ensures that, even if your system needs to be restored to completely new hardware, you’ll have flexibility in both configuration and the ability to adapt the system to the new environment.
