**Prompt Summary:** You are asking for the best format to send a design for a metal business card as text on a transparent background.

---

If you want to send your metal business card design with **text on a transparent background**, the best file format would be one that **supports transparency** and **retains high quality**. Here are the recommended formats:

### **1. PNG (.png)**
   - **Best for:** Digital previews, web use, or simple designs with transparency.
   - **Why PNG?**
     - **Supports Transparency:** PNG files allow you to keep the background transparent, making it ideal if you want the text to be visible without any background color.
     - **High-Resolution Support:** PNG is a lossless format, meaning the quality of the design won’t degrade, even if it contains detailed elements.
   - **Recommendation:** Use **high-resolution PNG** (at least **300 DPI**) to ensure the design remains clear and sharp.

### **2. SVG (.svg)**
   - **Best for:** Vector designs that need to be scalable without losing quality, especially for printing or digital preview.
   - **Why SVG?**
     - **Scalable and Editable:** SVG is a vector format, so it can be scaled up or down without any loss in quality. This is particularly useful if you want to resize the design or edit it later.
     - **Supports Transparency:** SVG files support transparent backgrounds, which is ideal for designs where the text must appear clean and floating.
   - **Recommendation:** SVG is ideal if your design includes vector elements (like custom typography or logos) and needs to be resized or manipulated without losing quality.

### **3. PDF (.pdf)**
   - **Best for:** Sending final design proofs for printing, especially if the design needs to be high-resolution and include precise layouts.
   - **Why PDF?**
     - **Supports Transparency (Vector PDF):** PDF files can maintain transparency and are suitable for printing. They preserve vector elements, ensuring the design remains sharp.
     - **Professional Printing Compatibility:** PDFs are widely accepted by professional printers, making them a good choice if you’re sending the design as part of a print order.
   - **Recommendation:** Use a **vector-based PDF** if your design involves custom fonts, logos, or any elements that should remain sharp and scalable. Make sure to export or save as **PDF/X** for print-ready formats.

### **4. EPS (.eps)**
   - **Best for:** Professional printing and vector design sharing.
   - **Why EPS?**
     - **Retains Vector Data:** Like SVG, EPS files are vector formats and can maintain transparency, sharpness, and detail at any size.
     - **Preferred for Professional Use:** Many print shops and designers work with EPS files because they preserve design elements cleanly.
   - **Recommendation:** Choose EPS if your design is created in vector software (like Adobe Illustrator) and needs to be sent for professional printing.

### **Conclusion**
The best format depends on how you intend to use and share the design:
- **For Digital Use (Web or Preview):** Use **PNG** to maintain transparency while keeping the file size manageable.
- **For Scalable Designs or Editing:** Use **SVG** for vector designs that need to be resized without losing quality.
- **For Professional Printing:** Use **PDF** or **EPS** to ensure the design remains high-quality, scalable, and compatible with print requirements. These formats retain transparency and are widely accepted by professional printers.
