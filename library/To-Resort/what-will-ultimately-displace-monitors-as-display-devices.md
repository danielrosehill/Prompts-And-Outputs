# Prompt

I have been working with a 3 screen desktop array for years. I am very fond of it and it has enhanced my productivity hugely. However, I think that ultimately LCD monitors will become legacy tech. Do you have any thoughts on what is likely to displace monitors as displace devices? Are there any early stage technologies of this nature? Especially those that can work with Fedora Linux? If you can think of any, don't forget to mention the RRPs!

# Output


Based on the search results and current trends in display technology, several emerging technologies could potentially displace traditional LCD monitors in the future. Here are some possibilities that might be compatible with Fedora Linux:

1. OLED Displays:
OLED technology is already replacing LCDs in many devices due to its superior image quality, perfect blacks, and thinner form factor. While currently more expensive, prices are expected to decrease as production scales up.
Potential RRP: $500-$2000 per display, depending on size and specifications.

2. MicroLED Displays:
MicroLED technology offers benefits similar to OLED but with longer lifespan and higher brightness. It's still in early stages for consumer products but shows promise for future desktop displays.
Potential RRP: Currently very expensive (thousands of dollars), but prices are expected to decrease significantly in the coming years.

3. Quantum Dot Displays (QLED):
While technically an enhancement to LCD technology, QLED offers improved color accuracy and brightness. It's a potential intermediate step before more advanced technologies become mainstream.
Potential RRP: $300-$1000 per display, depending on size and specifications.

4. Flexible and Foldable Displays:
These could revolutionize multi-monitor setups by allowing for curved or adjustable displays that can be repositioned as needed. However, they're still in early stages for desktop-sized applications.
Potential RRP: Not yet available in desktop sizes, but likely to be premium-priced when released.

5. Transparent Displays:
While more suited for specialized applications, transparent displays could offer unique possibilities for desktop setups, potentially allowing for overlay of digital content on the physical environment.
Potential RRP: Not yet widely available for consumer use.

6. Augmented Reality (AR) Glasses or Headsets:
While not traditional monitors, AR devices could potentially replace physical displays by projecting virtual screens into the user's field of view. This technology is still developing but could be revolutionary for productivity.
Potential RRP: Current AR headsets range from $500 to $3000, but prices and capabilities are likely to improve significantly in the coming years.

7. Holographic Displays:
Still in early research stages, holographic displays could provide 3D images without the need for special glasses. This technology is not yet commercially viable for desktop use.
Potential RRP: Not available for consumer purchase yet.

Compatibility with Fedora Linux:
Most of these display technologies should be compatible with Fedora Linux, as they typically use standard display interfaces (HDMI, DisplayPort, etc.). However, some features of newer displays might require specific drivers or software support, which could lag behind Windows or macOS availability.

It's worth noting that while these technologies show promise, widespread adoption and Linux compatibility may take time. Traditional LCD monitors are likely to remain common for several years due to their established manufacturing processes and lower costs.
