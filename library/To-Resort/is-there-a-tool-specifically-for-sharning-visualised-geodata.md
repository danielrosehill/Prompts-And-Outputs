   - **Key Features**:
     - Upload and manage spatial data (raster and vector formats).
     - Create interactive maps.
     - User-friendly interface with permission control for sharing maps.
     - Built-in support for **OGC** standards (WMS, WFS, etc.).
   - **Use Case**: Perfect for organizations and communities looking to collaboratively manage and share maps and datasets.
   - **Website**: [GeoNode](https://geonode.org/)

### 2. **MapServer**
   - **Description**: MapServer is an open-source platform for publishing spatial data and creating interactive web maps. It is highly configurable and can be used to serve maps and data in a wide range of formats.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Support for numerous geospatial data formats (Shapefiles, GeoTIFF, etc.).
     - Complies with **OGC standards** such as WMS, WFS, and WCS.
     - Can be integrated into existing websites or used as a standalone service.
     - Lightweight and fast for rendering maps dynamically.
   - **Use Case**: Suitable for developers who want more control over how geospatial data is served and visualized.
   - **Website**: [MapServer](https://mapserver.org/)

### 3. **Carto (Self-Hosted)**
   - **Description**: Carto, primarily known for its cloud-based platform, also offers open-source tools for creating and sharing geospatial visualizations. Carto.js, its open-source library, can be used to build custom geospatial applications and maps.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Beautiful, customizable visualizations with support for geospatial datasets.
     - API access for integration with other systems.
     - Self-hosted option available for managing your own infrastructure.
   - **Use Case**: Organizations looking to create beautiful, interactive maps with an easy-to-use interface and customizable themes.

### 6. **OpenStreetMap (OSM)**
   - **Description**: OpenStreetMap is a collaborative, open-source mapping platform. While itâ€™s primarily used for contributing to a global map database, its software stack (including **OSM Carto** and **Overpass API**) can be deployed locally to serve customized maps or build custom visualization platforms.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Global map data available for free.
     - Highly customizable for visualizing and publishing maps.
     - Community-driven, open-data ethos.
   - **Use Case**: Perfect for users who need a base map to overlay custom datasets.
   - **Website**: [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/)

### 7. **TileServer GL**
   - **Description**: TileServer GL is an open-source server for rendering vector tiles and maps, often used with **Mapbox GL**. It can host map data and serve it to web applications, allowing users to overlay custom datasets.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Serve vector and raster tiles.
     - High-performance map rendering.
     - Compatible with custom datasets, including geoJSON and MBTiles.
   - **Use Case**: Useful for developers who want to serve tilesets and maps directly from their server.
   - **Website**: [TileServer GL](https://tileserver.org/)

### 8. **NextGIS Web**
   - **Description**: NextGIS Web is an open-source platform for creating and managing geospatial data through a web-based interface. It supports creating maps, managing layers, and sharing data interactively.
