Yes, there are several **AI image generation tools** that offer the capability to generate **characters** and maintain **consistency** across multiple generations. Some of these tools allow you to fine-tune models, create custom characters, or even train the AI to recognize and reuse specific characters in different scenarios. Here are some of the best options for this purpose:

### 1. **Stable Diffusion with DreamBooth**
   - **What It Does**: DreamBooth, built on top of **Stable Diffusion**, allows you to fine-tune an AI model on specific images. You can train it to recognize a custom character and then reuse that character in different scenarios or settings. DreamBooth requires a set of images (usually around 10-20) of the character you want to generate, and it learns to replicate that character in new environments.
   - **How It Works**: You upload reference images of your character, and DreamBooth trains the model to generate new images based on that character’s traits, allowing for consistency across different scenes.
   - **Recommendation**: If you have a specific sloth character in mind, you can train the model with a few images of the sloth to ensure it is consistently represented in all generations.

   **Tools**: 
   - **DreamBooth** for Stable Diffusion (various implementations available, including Google Colab and local installation).
   - **RunwayML** (a more user-friendly interface for using Stable Diffusion and DreamBooth).

### 2. **Artbreeder**
   - **What It Does**: Artbreeder allows you to create custom characters by combining traits from different images. Once you create a character, you can **save it** and **generate new versions** of that character with different poses, expressions, or outfits. Artbreeder excels in keeping the character consistent across generations.
   - **How It Works**: You manipulate sliders or combine images to “breed” new characters. You can also use existing characters and modify their traits over time.
   - **Recommendation**: This is ideal for creating characters that can evolve and be placed in different settings while maintaining their core traits.

### 3. **Character.ai (Character Creation Focused)**
   - **What It Does**: This tool allows you to create custom characters, which can be reused in various scenarios. The AI keeps the core visual elements of the character consistent but generates different environments or poses based on your prompts.
   - **How It Works**: You create a character model and provide prompts for different actions or scenes. The AI reuses the established character traits and applies them to different scenes.
   - **Recommendation**: This tool is great if you need reusable characters that interact with various settings or objects while maintaining their original appearance.

### 4. **StyleGAN (for Custom Character Creation)**
   - **What It Does**: **StyleGAN** is a generative adversarial network that can be trained on specific images to generate consistent characters with different poses and in various contexts. It’s very flexible, allowing for high control over character traits and appearance.
   - **How It Works**: StyleGAN can be trained on a dataset of a particular character, and once trained, it can generate endless variations of that character in different scenarios while keeping consistency.
   - **Recommendation**: If you need a lot of control over character design and consistency, StyleGAN is one of the most powerful options, though it requires technical knowledge to set up and train.

### 5. **MidJourney (with Variations)**
   - **What It Does**: **MidJourney** doesn’t allow for explicit character saving, but it offers the ability to create **variations** of a specific image. You can fine-tune characters by selecting different generated variations, refining the character design step by step. Although it's more artistic and less technical than Stable Diffusion or DreamBooth, you can generate recurring characters with consistent prompts.
   - **How It Works**: You generate an image of your character and then create variations based on that image. Through several iterations, you can produce a consistent character across scenes.
   - **Recommendation**: If you enjoy the artistic and stylistic approach and don’t need pixel-perfect character consistency, MidJourney is a good choice for creating recurring characters.

### 6. **ProsePainter (Neural Style Transfer for Character Creation)**
   - **What It Does**: **ProsePainter** is designed for illustration and can be used to create consistent character styles for storybooks. It allows you to maintain the character design while placing them in different scenes or poses by transferring the same artistic style across generations.
   - **How It Works**: You design your character and apply consistent style transfer across different backgrounds or scenes, ensuring the character remains visually consistent.
   - **Recommendation**: This is particularly useful if you want a character to have a stylized, storybook look while maintaining a coherent appearance across images.

### 7. **Deep Dream Generator**
   - **What It Does**: While **Deep Dream Generator** is more known for stylized art, you can upload character designs and use them in multiple contexts with the same style. It works by applying consistent dream-like transformations, so you can retain some of the character’s core features in new generations.
   - **How It Works**: You upload an image or character, and the AI applies different variations or settings while keeping the base character design recognizable.
   - **Recommendation**: Best for surreal or dreamy character design, though not ideal for hyper-realistic characters.

### 8. **MetaHuman (Unreal Engine)**
   - **What It Does**: MetaHuman is a tool by Unreal Engine designed for creating lifelike 3D characters. You can create highly realistic, consistent characters and reuse them in different scenes, including animations. Although not primarily an AI image generator, it’s an excellent option if you want **consistent, ultra-realistic characters** that can be reused.
   - **How It Works**: You create and customize a character in Unreal Engine’s MetaHuman Creator, then use that character across different settings and animations. It is highly customizable and great for maintaining a specific character in a realistic style.
   - **Recommendation**: This is best for photorealistic or animated characters in 3D, but requires more technical setup than most AI tools.

### Conclusion: Best Tools for Character Consistency
- **DreamBooth with Stable Diffusion**: Best for photorealistic images where you need to train a custom model for character consistency.
- **Artbreeder**: Ideal for customizable characters that evolve while keeping a coherent style.
- **StyleGAN**: Most powerful for precise character control, but requires technical expertise.
- **MidJourney**: For artistic variations, where you can guide the process with prompts but may not have perfect control.
- **MetaHuman (Unreal Engine)**: Best for 3D, lifelike characters in animation and games.

Each of these tools can help overcome the challenge of maintaining consistent characters in generated images. Would you like more details on any of these tools, or guidance on how to get started with one of them?
