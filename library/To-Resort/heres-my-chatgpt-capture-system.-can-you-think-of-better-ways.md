# Prompt

Can you identify any note taking apps which support a grid layout? I'm working with a lot of markdown files in Obsidian. I'm looking to create something like a quadrant. 

My workflow is like this:

I have a folder of context snippets
I use ChatGPT via its web UI
I save worthwhile outputs into an outputs folder in the markdown vault
I also manage and work on prompts there

I'm trying to bundle this all up into a cohesive layout as switching between all these windows (trying to find context docs in that window, edit prompts in another) makes this system cumbersome. 

Can you suggest any methods or tools that might help?

Fedora + KDE Plasma + Wayland

# Output

To create a more cohesive interface that supports your need for multiple panes (like a **quadrant layout**) where you can interact with your **context snippets**, **ChatGPT** interface, **outputs**, and **prompts** simultaneously, here are some tools and methods that could help:

### Tools Supporting a Quadrant/Grid Layout with Markdown Focus

#### 1. **Logseq**
**Logseq** is an outliner-based, markdown-native note-taking tool similar to Obsidian, but with some features that might better support your workflow:
- **Multiple Panes**: Logseq allows you to open multiple pages side-by-side. You can easily split your view into multiple panels where you could keep your context, outputs, and prompts open all at once.
- **Markdown Support**: It supports markdown just like Obsidian, making it easy to transition without losing your markdown data structure.
- **Linked References and Graph**: Logseq has a strong graph view and linked references feature that might help you navigate between context and prompts quickly.
- **Linux Compatibility**: It's compatible with Fedora and other Linux distributions.

#### 2. **Notion (with Columns and Linked Databases)**
**Notion** is highly versatile and allows you to create a dashboard-like page with **multiple columns** that could simulate a grid or quadrant layout:
- **Custom Columns**: You can create sections on one page, each representing a different folder or type of content (e.g., context snippets, output, prompts).
- **Markdown-Like Editing**: Although Notion doesn’t work exactly like markdown editors, it supports most markdown features and formats your pasted markdown as rich text.
- **Embed External Links**: You can embed the ChatGPT web UI as an iframe or a linked page, allowing for quick access from within your Notion workspace.

#### 3. **RemNote**
**RemNote** is a note-taking app that combines elements of **knowledge management**, **spaced repetition**, and **markdown** support.
- **Pane System**: RemNote supports having multiple **panes** open simultaneously, which would allow you to keep different parts of your vault—context, prompts, outputs—all accessible at once.
- **Markdown and Linking**: It supports markdown natively, which would make transferring your existing files easy.
- **Split View**: You can have a split view for different documents, which is perfect for a quadrant-style interface.

#### 4. **Joplin**
**Joplin** is a markdown note-taking application that supports multiple views and is available on **Linux**.
- **Markdown Editor**: Joplin is markdown-native, which is essential for keeping your current workflow intact.
- **Panels and Tabs**: It allows for **tabs** to be open simultaneously, which can be useful if you need to switch between context, prompts, and outputs easily.
- **Third-Party Plugins**: There are plugins available that allow more customization in terms of layout, which may help create a more grid-like view.

#### 5. **Tana**
**Tana** is an evolving note-taking and organization tool that offers **dynamic views** that may work similarly to a quadrant layout:
- **Multiple Panes and Nested Views**: You can organize your content into different panels, and the tool supports linking related pieces of information intuitively, which can help create a cohesive working space.
- **Linux and Browser Compatibility**: As Tana is browser-based, it will work with your Fedora and KDE setup.

#### 6. **Emacs with Org-Mode and EXWM**
For a more **Linux-native solution**, you could use **Emacs** with **Org-mode** along with the **EXWM (Emacs X Window Manager)**:
- **Org-Mode**: Org-mode is one of the most powerful tools for note-taking, knowledge management, and planning, and it supports markdown-like syntax.
- **EXWM**: This would allow you to use Emacs as a window manager on **Wayland**, effectively creating a quadrant layout where you can have different buffers open—each representing your context, prompts, outputs, or even a ChatGPT interface embedded through a browser buffer.

### Potential Workflows for a Quadrant-Like Layout

#### 1. **KDE Plasma Split Views and Custom Tiling with Wayland**
Since you are using KDE Plasma on Wayland, you can use some of KDE’s native tiling abilities to arrange your windows:
- **Krohnkite Extension**: This extension brings **tiling window management** to KDE Plasma, allowing you to set up **custom tiles** where you can keep Obsidian, a browser window with ChatGPT, and other tools all arranged in a quadrant.
- **Konsole with Tabs and Splits**: If you prefer terminal-based solutions, you could open multiple **Konsoles** and split them horizontally and vertically to simulate a quadrant view, while running different applications in each.

#### 2. **Tiling Window Managers** 
Consider using a **tiling window manager** within KDE Plasma, or even switching to a standalone tiling window manager that works well with Wayland, like:
- **Sway**: A tiling window manager compatible with Wayland that allows you to set up custom layouts where you can have different panes (e.g., Obsidian for markdown notes, a browser for ChatGPT).
- **i3 with Wayland Compatibility**: The **i3 window manager**, along with Wayland compatibility through **Sway**, can be configured to create a quadrant workspace, helping you keep all your workflow components visible and organized.

### Summary and Recommendation
- **Logseq** and **RemNote** provide strong markdown support and multiple panes that could closely simulate a quadrant interface.
- **Notion** and **Tana** are browser-based tools that provide a lot of layout flexibility, allowing you to set up a grid-like page where you can manage different types of content simultaneously.
- For a **Linux-native approach**, **Joplin** provides markdown editing with tabs, while **Emacs with Org-mode and EXWM** allows for ultimate customization.
- Utilize KDE's **tiling features** or switch to a **tiling window manager** like **Sway** or **i3** to create your ideal working layout without switching tools.

The combination of a good note-taking app that allows multiple views with KDE's strong customization features could provide a cohesive and productive workspace. Consider **Logseq** or **RemNote** for markdown handling with panes and pair them with KDE’s tiling capabilities for an optimal experience.
