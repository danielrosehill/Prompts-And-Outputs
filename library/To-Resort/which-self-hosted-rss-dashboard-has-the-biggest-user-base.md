# Prompt

Of the self-hosted RSS dashboards, which has the biggest user-base and is most established? And so any of them allow users to display feeds from non-RSS-serving sites via some mechanism?

# Output

The most **established and widely-used self-hosted RSS dashboard** tool is **Grafana**. Although Grafana is primarily known for monitoring and data visualization, it has gained a significant user base for its flexibility in integrating multiple data sources, including **RSS feeds** via plugins or external tools.

### 1. **Grafana**:
   - **User Base**: Grafana has a massive and growing user base, with millions of installations globally. It is widely used across various industries for real-time monitoring and analytics, including RSS integration via **JSON** or **external plugins**.
   - **Feed Sources**: Grafana can display data from **non-RSS sources** if you configure a data source to extract content from those sites, such as APIs, JSON endpoints, or custom scrapers.
   - **Non-RSS Feeds**: While it doesn't natively pull content from non-RSS-serving sites, you can use third-party tools or APIs to convert website content into a format Grafana can display. For example, tools like **RSSBridge** can convert non-RSS sites into feeds【365†source】.

### 2. **Freeboard**:
   - **User Base**: Freeboard has a smaller but loyal user base focused on real-time data dashboards. It’s less popular than Grafana but still widely used for lighter, less resource-intensive applications.
   - **Feed Sources**: Freeboard supports multiple data formats (JSON, APIs) and could theoretically display content from non-RSS sites using an intermediary like a JSON feed or a converted RSS feed, but it doesn’t directly support non-RSS sources.

### 3. **Homer**:
   - **User Base**: **Homer** is primarily a service dashboard for organizing and displaying apps and services. While it can embed content like web pages, its primary function isn't for live feed management, and it has a smaller user base compared to Grafana.
   - **Non-RSS Feeds**: Homer does not natively support non-RSS feed embedding.

### Displaying Feeds from Non-RSS Sites:
Several tools can help convert non-RSS websites into RSS feeds or display content:
- **RSS-Bridge**: A widely-used, self-hosted tool that can convert **non-RSS-serving sites** into RSS feeds by scraping the content. It supports a wide variety of websites, including news outlets and social media platforms. This allows you to feed non-RSS sources into dashboards like Grafana or Freeboard【365†source】.
- **Apprise**: Apprise is a notification management tool that integrates with a wide range of services (RSS, APIs, etc.) and can be paired with dashboards to display non-RSS feeds. This tool could be helpful when paired with a dashboard that lacks native support.

### Conclusion:
- **Grafana** is the most established and widely-used self-hosted dashboard with RSS feed support, and it can handle non-RSS-serving sites through third-party tools like **RSSBridge** or direct API integration.
- **Freeboard** offers lightweight real-time dashboards, but its user base and features are more limited compared to Grafana. Both can be extended to support non-RSS content with additional tools or feeds.

For flexibility, a combination of **Grafana** and **RSS-Bridge** is likely your best option.
