Yes, in **Canva**, you can provide your invitation text and let the platform's **Magic Design Tool** generate a design based on it. Here's how you can do it:

### Steps to Create a Design in Canva from Text:
1. **Sign In to Canva**: Go to [Canva](https://www.canva.com) and log in to your account (or sign up if you don't have one).
   
2. **Choose a Template**:
   - You can start by selecting a template that fits your desired format (invitation, poster, social media post, etc.).
   - If you want Canva to suggest designs, type "invitation" or the document type into the search bar.

3. **Input Text Using Magic Design**:
   - Once you're on the design page, you can enter your text in the editor.
   - Use Canva’s **Magic Design** or **Text Suggestions** feature by providing your invitation text. Canva will suggest design elements like layout, fonts, and colors that suit the text.
   - You can either paste the text directly into the editor or upload it as part of a larger document, and Canva will fit it into the design.

4. **Customize the Design**:
   - Canva will suggest layouts, fonts, and themes based on your input. You can choose from the AI-generated suggestions or further customize by changing fonts, colors, images, and decorative elements.
   - You can use AI-suggested graphics and photos to fit your theme (e.g., floral accents or subtle candlelight).

5. **Refine and Download**:
   - Once you’re happy with the design, you can download it as an image or PDF.

With Canva’s **Magic Design Tool**, the AI helps make design decisions based on the content you provide, saving time and enhancing the visual impact of your invitations.
