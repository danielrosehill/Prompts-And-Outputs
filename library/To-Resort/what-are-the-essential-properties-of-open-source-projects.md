**Summary of your prompt:** You want to explore the essential properties of an open-source project, especially in the context of data releases, and are considering whether the open-source model you envision—where "open source" does not mean "everything should be free"—has a clear definition.

### Essential Properties of an Open-Source Project:
To be considered truly open source, a project typically needs to meet certain criteria based on established principles like the **Open Source Definition (OSD)** provided by the Open Source Initiative (OSI). Here are some key properties:

1. **Access to Source Code (or Data):**
   - The project’s source code (or in the case of a data release, the data itself) must be **publicly accessible**.
   - Users must be able to view, modify, and distribute the source or data.

2. **Freedom to Modify and Redistribute:**
   - Open source means that users are allowed to **modify** the source code or data and **redistribute** their changes. This applies to both software and data projects.
   - Any restrictions on modifications, as long as they don’t prohibit sharing or adaptations, might limit the project’s openness.

3. **No Discrimination:**
   - The project should be open to **anyone**. It cannot limit access based on specific fields of endeavor (e.g., "non-commercial use only") or discriminate against individuals or groups.

4. **Licensing:**
   - Open-source projects must use a recognized open-source license that guarantees the right to use, modify, and redistribute the code or data.
   - Common licenses include **MIT, Apache 2.0, GNU GPL**, or for data, licenses like **Open Data Commons Open Database License (ODbL)**.

5. **Transparency:**
   - There must be **transparency** in how the project is maintained and developed, often including contributions, discussions, and decision-making processes.
   - For data, this means full transparency in the methodology of how the data was collected, cleaned, and processed.

### Open Source and Data Releases:
In the context of a **data release**, to qualify as open source, the following conditions should typically be met:

- **Access to Raw Data:** The raw dataset must be accessible and downloadable in a usable format (e.g., CSV, JSON, SQL).
- **Modifiability:** Users should have the right to **modify, combine, and analyze** the data for any purpose, including commercial use (depending on licensing).
- **Redistribution Rights:** Users should be able to **redistribute** the data, with or without modifications, under the same open-source license.
- **Attribution and Licensing:** There must be clear guidelines on attribution, and the data should be under an open data license that aligns with open-source principles.

What **wouldn’t** qualify as open source for data releases:
- **Limited Access:** If the data is behind a paywall or restricted access system.
- **Non-modifiable Data:** If the data is provided in a locked format that can’t be modified or adapted.
- **Restricted Redistribution:** If users are not allowed to redistribute the data, either in its original or modified form.

### Open Source Doesn’t Mean Free:
The model you envision—where **open source does not necessarily mean free**—is aligned with a growing perspective in the open-source community. In your model, the source code or data is openly accessible and modifiable, but the expectation is that **maintenance, support, or certain uses** (such as commercial ones) could be monetized.

This model fits into the broader understanding of open source, with some nuance:

- **Free Access to Code or Data:** The essential aspect remains that the code/data is **freely available** and users have the freedom to modify and distribute it.
- **Paid Services or Features:** Where the distinction lies is in the **monetization of services** around the project. For example, support, hosting, customization, or advanced features could come at a cost, but the core remains open and accessible.
- **Dual Licensing:** This model often works with **dual licensing**, where the open-source project is available for free use under one license (e.g., GPL), but commercial users can purchase a separate license for more freedom (e.g., proprietary uses).

### Defining Your Model:
Your model might best be described as **open source with sustainable monetization**. The idea is that **the core project (code or data) remains open**, but there are optional paid services (support, premium features, commercial licenses) to ensure that developers and contributors can sustain themselves and the project in the long term.

This is sometimes referred to as an **"open core" model**:
- **Open Core Model:** The essential parts of the software/data are open, but additional features, modules, or services are paid. This ensures the sustainability of the project while maintaining openness.
  
You can contrast this with the idea of **free/libre software**, where the expectation is not just access to the source but that everything is entirely free and open. Your model is more pragmatic, recognizing the financial needs of maintaining high-quality projects.

### Conclusion:
The open-source model you envision aligns with the **open core** approach, where the **essential project remains open**, but there is room for **monetization** in terms of support, premium features, or services. This approach addresses the unsustainability of the "everything free" mentality while still adhering to the foundational principles of open access and freedom to modify and redistribute. Many in the community, especially around mature tools like Cloudron, are moving toward this balanced approach.
