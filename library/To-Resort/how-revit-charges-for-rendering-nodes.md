Autodesk Revit uses cloud-based rendering services, specifically Autodesk's **Cloud Rendering** via **Autodesk A360** or newer cloud platforms like **Autodesk Construction Cloud**. The process of charging for rendering nodes in Revit primarily revolves around the consumption of **cloud credits** rather than directly counting individual rendering nodes. Here's how it works:

### **1. Cloud Rendering and Cloud Credits**
- Autodesk Revit allows users to **offload rendering tasks to the cloud**. This is beneficial for complex renderings that would otherwise take significant time and resources on a local machine.
- **Cloud Credits** are the unit of currency used by Autodesk to charge for cloud rendering services. Each rendering task in Revit consumes a certain number of cloud credits, which depends on various factors:
  - **Complexity of the Model**: More detailed models with more objects, textures, and effects require more processing power, resulting in higher credit usage.
  - **Output Quality**: Higher resolution or higher quality renderings (e.g., HD or photorealistic) consume more cloud credits.
  - **Output Size**: Larger output images also consume more credits.
  - **Features Used**: Advanced rendering effects like artificial lighting, reflections, and shadows may increase credit consumption.

### **2. Cloud Credits Cost and Usage**
- **Cloud Credits Purchase**: Users need to purchase cloud credits in advance. Typically, these credits are either bought through Autodesk or may be included as part of some subscription plans, depending on the level of the plan.
- **Cost of Cloud Credits**: The pricing for cloud credits varies depending on the region and the type of Autodesk account. Usually, one cloud credit costs around $1, but it can be less with volume purchases or specific subscription benefits.
- **Rendering Node Equivalent**: In the context of Autodesk's cloud rendering, users do not directly rent or buy rendering nodes. Instead, the **cloud infrastructure determines the number of nodes** dynamically to complete the task, and the consumption is reflected in the number of credits used.

### **3. Desktop Rendering vs. Cloud Rendering Nodes**
- **Local Nodes (Local Rendering)**: When rendering locally on Revit, the user is utilizing the CPU and GPU resources of their workstation. This does not require cloud credits, but the performance is directly dependent on the hardware capacity.
- **Cloud Nodes**: Autodesk's cloud rendering services automatically allocate the number of nodes required to complete a rendering task efficiently. More nodes may be allocated for larger, more complex tasks, and this affects how quickly the rendering is completed. The **amount of cloud credits consumed is influenced by the number of nodes utilized**, but users don't need to manually specify or control this.

### **4. Rendering Types and Their Charges**
- **Standard Render**: Simple views (e.g., draft or low-quality renderings) usually consume fewer cloud credits.
- **Photorealistic Render**: Higher quality, photorealistic renderings require more resources, hence more credits.
- **Panoramas and Solar Studies**: Interactive or animated renderings like **360-degree panoramas** or **solar studies** can consume significantly more credits compared to static images.

### **5. Autodesk Subscription Plans and Rendering Costs**
- Autodesk often includes a certain number of **free cloud credits** with paid subscription plans like **AEC Collection**. If more credits are required beyond what's provided:
  - **Additional Cloud Credits** can be purchased in blocks.
  - Some enterprise-level subscription plans include more cloud credits for use.

### **Summary**
Autodesk Revit charges for rendering nodes indirectly by using **cloud credits** for **cloud rendering** tasks:
- The **number of cloud credits** required depends on the complexity, quality, and size of the rendering.
- Users do not directly pay for rendering nodes; they pay in **cloud credits**, which cover the computational resources allocated for rendering tasks.
- **Local rendering** is an alternative that doesn't require cloud credits but relies on the user's hardware capacity.
