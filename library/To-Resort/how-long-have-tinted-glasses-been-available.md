Your prompt asks how long different types of tinted glasses, such as FL-41, blue light blocking glasses, and gray-tinted glasses, have been on the market, and whether this is a new trend.

### Historical Overview of Tinted Glasses:

#### 1. **FL-41 Lenses (for Light Sensitivity and Migraines)**
   - **Introduction**: FL-41 lenses were first developed in the **1990s**. Originally, they were designed to help **migraine sufferers** and people with **light sensitivity** (photophobia), particularly for those sensitive to **fluorescent lighting** and **screen glare**.
   - **Evolution**: Over time, these lenses have gained popularity among people with conditions such as **blepharospasm**, **post-concussion syndrome**, and **chronic migraines**. However, they have remained relatively niche and are primarily recommended by medical professionals.

#### 2. **Blue Light Blocking Glasses**
   - **Introduction**: Blue light blocking glasses began gaining attention in the **early 2010s** as screens became more prevalent in daily life due to the rise of smartphones, computers, and tablets. Blue light filters emerged as a response to concerns about **digital eye strain** and **sleep disruption** caused by prolonged exposure to screens.
   - **Evolution**: The **2010s** saw a rapid rise in blue light glasses as tech use became more widespread. Major brands started producing **blue light filtering lenses**, and the glasses became mainstream with tech users, gamers, and office workers.
   - **Mainstream Popularity**: In the last 5-10 years, they’ve seen explosive growth as part of the **wellness movement**, with a focus on combating the **adverse effects of blue light** on **sleep cycles** and **eye strain**.

#### 3. **Gray-Tinted Glasses (for Indoor and Outdoor Use)**
   - **Introduction**: **Gray-tinted lenses** have been available for several decades, primarily as a **sunglasses tint** for reducing overall light without distorting colors. However, gray-tinted glasses designed specifically for **indoor use** (for people with light sensitivity) became more widely used in recent years, particularly for those with photophobia or sensitivity to artificial light.
   - **Evolution**: Gray lenses have been used in medical contexts for many years to assist with **light sensitivity** (similar to FL-41 lenses). However, they’ve been marketed more widely in recent times as a solution for people who find everyday lighting, especially in office settings, too harsh.

#### 4. **Polarized Glasses**
   - **Introduction**: **Polarized lenses** were introduced as far back as the **1930s**, initially for use in **sunglasses** to reduce glare from reflective surfaces like water or roads. They’ve been widely used in **outdoor sunglasses** ever since.
   - **Evolution**: While primarily for outdoor use, polarized glasses have become more sophisticated and are sometimes marketed for use in high-glare indoor environments, though this remains relatively uncommon.

### Recent Trends:
- **Growth in Popularity (2010s – Present)**: Over the last decade, the surge in screen use, along with growing awareness of **light sensitivity**, **digital eye strain**, and the potential harms of **blue light**, has driven rapid growth in the market for different types of tinted glasses. **Blue light blocking glasses**, in particular, have seen mainstream adoption starting in the early 2010s.
  
- **Post-Pandemic Acceleration (2020s)**: The **COVID-19 pandemic** further accelerated the use of tinted glasses, as **remote work** and **increased screen time** led to greater demand for solutions to reduce **digital eye strain** and **sleep disruption**. This has contributed to more widespread awareness of both **blue light glasses** and specialized tints like **FL-41** and **gray-tinted lenses**.

### Conclusion:
- **FL-41 lenses** have been around since the **1990s**, primarily as a solution for **migraine sufferers** and people with **light sensitivity**.
- **Blue light blocking glasses** began gaining traction in the **early 2010s** and became widely popular in the last decade due to concerns about **screen use**.
- **Gray-tinted lenses** have long been used in **sunglasses**, but their use as **indoor light sensitivity glasses** has become more visible in recent years, particularly for those with **photophobia**.
- **Polarized lenses** have been around since the **1930s**, but their primary application remains in **sunglasses** for outdoor glare reduction.

So, while some of these glasses are more recent (like blue light glasses), others, like FL-41 and gray-tinted glasses, have been around for several decades but are only now gaining wider attention for indoor use.
