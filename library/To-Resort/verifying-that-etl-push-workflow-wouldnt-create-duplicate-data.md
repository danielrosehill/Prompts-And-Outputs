# Prompt

My preference would be to manually run the loading process into Postgres. Which is to say that I would run it through a script or something that I would manually initiate. I just want to make clear, though. As this script would be running repeatedly, it would have the capability to push up the new data incrementally? Ie, there's some way for it to keep track of previously uploaded notes so that it doesn't create lots of duplicate data from old runs?

# Output

Yes, it is definitely possible to design your script so that it can **incrementally push** new data into **PostgreSQL** without creating duplicate entries. This approach can be implemented manually, allowing you to run the script when you see fit, while still ensuring that it only adds or updates data when necessary. Here are some key techniques to make this happen:

### **How to Manage Incremental Updates and Prevent Duplicates**
To achieve incremental data loading and prevent duplicate entries, you can implement the following methods:

#### **1. Identify Changes with Metadata (e.g., Last Modified Timestamp)**
- Each document can include a metadata field, like a **last modified date** or **unique identifier**.
- When parsing markdown files, your script should extract this metadata. When running the loading process, it can compare the `last modified` value against what's already stored in the database to determine if an update is needed.

**Implementation in Python**:
1. **Check if the Document Exists**:
   - Use a unique key like the **title** or a **UUID**. You can either include an explicit identifier in each markdown file or generate one and store it in the database.

2. **Compare Last Modified**:
   - Compare the last modified timestamp from the filesystem with the `updated_at` field in the database.
   - If the file is new or has been modified since the last database update, insert or update the data accordingly.

```python
import os
import psycopg2
from datetime import datetime

# Database connection settings
conn = psycopg2.connect(
    dbname="your_database_name",
    user="your_username",
    password="your_password",
    host="localhost",
    port="5432"
)
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Folder paths
context_folder = "/path/to/context_snippets"

def load_context_snippets():
    for filename in os.listdir(context_folder):
        if filename.endswith(".md"):
            file_path = os.path.join(context_folder, filename)
            title = filename.replace(".md", "")
            last_modified = datetime.fromtimestamp(os.path.getmtime(file_path))

            # Read file content
            with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
                content = file.read()

            # Check if document already exists
            cursor.execute("SELECT id, updated_at FROM context_snippets WHERE title = %s", (title,))
            result = cursor.fetchone()

            if result:
                db_id, db_last_modified = result
                # If file is newer, update the record
                if last_modified > db_last_modified:
                    cursor.execute(
                        "UPDATE context_snippets SET body = %s, updated_at = %s WHERE id = %s",
                        (content, last_modified, db_id)
                    )
            else:
                # Insert new record
                cursor.execute(
                    "INSERT INTO context_snippets (title, body, created_at, updated_at) VALUES (%s, %s, %s, %s)",
                    (title, content, last_modified, last_modified)
                )

# Run the loading function
load_context_snippets()

# Commit changes and close connection
conn.commit()
cursor.close()
conn.close()
```

### **Explanation of the Key Elements**
1. **Metadata Tracking (`last_modified`)**:
   - **File Metadata**: The script extracts the **last modified timestamp** from each markdown file and compares it to the value in the database (`updated_at`).
   - **Database Fields**: The table has both `created_at` and `updated_at` columns to track when the document was first added and when it was last modified.

2. **Duplicate Prevention**:
   - **Unique Constraint on Title**: You can enforce a **unique constraint** on the `title` field in the PostgreSQL schema. This ensures that only one version of a document with the same title exists.
   - **Conditional Update**: The script uses a conditional check. If a document with the same title already exists but has a different `last_modified` date, it will **update** the existing record instead of inserting a duplicate.

3. **Manual Trigger for the Script**:
   - **Manually Run Script**: Since your preference is to **manually run** the ETL, you can execute the script whenever you want to sync your database. You might even consider creating a **shell script** to make it more convenient to run from your terminal.

### **Alternative Approaches for Keeping Track of Previous Uploads**
If you want to avoid using file metadata or prefer a more explicit tracking approach:

1. **Store a Hash of the Content**:
   - Calculate a **hash** (e.g., MD5 or SHA256) of the documentâ€™s content and store it in the database.
   - Every time the script runs, it generates a hash of the file and checks it against the hash stored in the database. If the hash differs, it means the content has changed, and the record should be updated.

2. **Use a UUID System**:
   - Assign a **UUID** to each markdown file that remains consistent across versions. This UUID would act as a primary key and help the script determine whether a document is new or should be updated.

3. **Incremental Versioning**:
   - Add a **version number** to each document, and store the latest version in the database. This versioning approach helps easily track and update modifications without redundancy.

### **Manual Run: Making It Convenient**
Since you plan to **manually trigger** the data load:
- You could create a simple **shell script** that you execute whenever you want to update the database:
  ```bash
  #!/bin/bash
  echo "Starting ETL process..."
  python3 /path/to/etl_script.py
  echo "ETL process complete."
  ```
- Another option is to run it from **Jupyter Notebooks**. This can help you visualize the steps and outputs, making debugging easier.

### **Summary**
- **ETL Approach**: The ETL workflow makes perfect sense for incremental updates. The Python script will handle changes and updates without creating duplicate entries.
- **Metadata**: Keep track of metadata (`last modified date`, `unique identifier`) to determine if a document should be **inserted** or **updated**.
- **Preventing Duplicates**: Check existing records by title, UUID, or hash to determine if a document has already been uploaded.
- **Manual Execution**: Run the script manually whenever you need, ensuring that the new or modified markdown files are pushed to PostgreSQL without duplication.

This incremental process ensures that your PostgreSQL database evolves in sync with your markdown repository, which will make transitioning to a custom interface later on much smoother. If you need more guidance on implementing any specific part of this process, feel free to ask!
