Yes, some monitors are better suited for vertical use due to their design, aspect ratio, and stand adjustability. Here are a few factors to consider:

### 1. **Aspect Ratio**:
   - **16:10** or **3:2 aspect ratio** monitors are better suited for vertical orientation because they provide more width than standard 16:9 monitors when flipped vertically.
   - Your current **AOC 2275W** has a 16:9 ratio, which can feel too narrow when vertical.

### 2. **Stand Adjustability**:
   - Look for monitors with **height adjustment** and **pivot features**, making it easy to switch between horizontal and vertical modes.

### Recommended Monitors for Vertical Use:
1. **Dell UltraSharp U2415** (16:10 aspect ratio, excellent for vertical use).
2. **HP Z24n G2** (highly adjustable stand, good for coding and writing).
3. **LG DualUp Monitor** (unique taller aspect ratio).

These options give you more space and flexibility compared to a traditional 16:9 monitor when flipped vertically.
