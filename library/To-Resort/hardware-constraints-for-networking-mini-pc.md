# Prompt

You should have the hardware details and constraints from previous context. Can you provide recommendations for the VM size

# Output

Based on the hardware details you've shared about the **mini PC**—including an **Intel Celeron N5095 (quad-core CPU)**, **16 GB DDR4 RAM**, and a **128 GB NVMe SSD**—here are the recommendations for the VM size on Proxmox:

### **CPU Allocation**
- **3 out of 4 CPU Cores**: 
  - Assign **3 cores** to the VM. This leaves **1 core** available for Proxmox to handle system management tasks without contention.
  - This balance helps ensure that the VM has the computational power required for services while still keeping Proxmox responsive.

### **Memory Allocation**
- **12 GB RAM for the VM**:
  - Allocate **12 GB** of RAM to the VM, and keep **4 GB** for Proxmox itself and other management overhead.
  - **12 GB** should be sufficient for running resource-intensive services like **NGINX**, **WireGuard**, **Docker containers**, and Cloudflare tunnels simultaneously, while leaving some memory for caching and additional services.

### **Storage Allocation**
- **80-100 GB of Storage**:
  - Assign **80-100 GB** to the VM from the **128 GB NVMe SSD**.
  - This should be enough to accommodate the operating system, Docker containers, application data, and logs, while leaving **20-40 GB** for snapshots, Proxmox backups, and general maintenance.

### **Networking Configuration**
- **Network Bridge (`vmbr0`)**:
  - Assign a **bridged network adapter** to the VM using `vmbr0`. This ensures the VM has a direct connection to your LAN.
  - **Static IP Address**: Assign a static IP address to simplify management and integration with other network services.

### **Summary**
- **CPU**: 3 cores for the VM, 1 for Proxmox.
- **Memory**: 12 GB RAM for the VM, 4 GB for Proxmox.
- **Storage**: 80-100 GB for the VM, with remaining space reserved for snapshots and Proxmox needs.

This configuration should allow your VM to handle the home networking project effectively while leaving sufficient resources for Proxmox's stability and flexibility. Let me know if you need further guidance or help with setting up the services on this VM!
