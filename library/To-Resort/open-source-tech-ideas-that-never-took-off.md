**Prompt Summary:** You asked for examples of some wacky open-source tech ideas that never really took off or gained a substantial user base.

### Examples of Wacky Open-Source Tech Ideas That Didn’t Gain Traction


2. **Emacspeak**
   - **Description:** Emacspeak is an audio desktop built as an extension for Emacs. It was designed to allow visually impaired users to interact with the computer via auditory feedback. Essentially, it turned Emacs into a complete audio-based user interface.
   - **Why It Didn’t Take Off:** Although Emacspeak was innovative and provided an impressive level of functionality for visually impaired users, it was limited by Emacs’s steep learning curve and niche audience. While it remains a powerful tool for some, it never gained mainstream popularity.

3. **SoylentNews**
   - **Description:** After the open-source tech community site Slashdot underwent significant changes (like the introduction of a new commenting system), disgruntled users created SoylentNews as a community-run alternative. The idea was to bring back the "good old days" of Slashdot with an open-source platform.
   - **Why It Didn’t Take Off:** Despite a strong start, SoylentNews failed to attract a substantial audience outside of the small group of ex-Slashdot users. Its focus on niche tech content and a traditional forum model didn’t appeal broadly, and it remained a small, dedicated community rather than a mainstream site.

4. **Haiku OS**
   - **Description:** Haiku OS is an open-source operating system inspired by BeOS, a multimedia-focused OS from the 1990s. Haiku aimed to continue the vision of BeOS, focusing on simplicity, speed, and efficiency, particularly for multimedia tasks.
   - **Why It Didn’t Take Off:** While it has a dedicated community, Haiku OS never achieved widespread adoption. Most users have moved on to Linux, Windows, or macOS, leaving Haiku in a niche category. The project's slow development and the rise of more mainstream alternatives contributed to its limited reach.

5. **OpenMoko**
   - **Description:** OpenMoko was one of the earliest open-source smartphone platforms, aiming to provide a fully open Linux-based mobile OS that users could customize. It was shipped on devices like the Neo1973 and the Neo FreeRunner.
   - **Why It Didn’t Take Off:** The hardware was clunky, the software was buggy, and it lacked the app ecosystem that Android and iOS offered. While the idea of an open-source phone was ahead of its time, the execution and timing were off, leading to commercial failure.

6. **GNU Hurd**
   - **Description:** GNU Hurd was intended to be the official kernel of the GNU operating system, aiming to provide a modular and flexible microkernel architecture. It started development in the 1980s, even before Linux.
   - **Why It Didn’t Take Off:** Hurd never reached a stable release despite decades of development. It was overshadowed by Linux, which rapidly gained traction due to its robustness, performance, and simpler architecture. Hurd’s complexity and the slow pace of progress meant it never gained the same user base.

7. **Diaspora**
   - **Description:** Diaspora was a decentralized, open-source social network that aimed to be a privacy-respecting alternative to Facebook. Users could set up their own "pods" (servers) and connect with other pods, ensuring more control over their data.
   - **Why It Didn’t Take Off:** While the concept of a decentralized social network was appealing, Diaspora struggled with adoption. The technical setup was daunting for the average user, and it didn’t have the same network effects that drove people to mainstream platforms like Facebook. 

8. **Project Xanadu**
   - **Description:** Often regarded as the world's first hypertext project, Project Xanadu was envisioned by Ted Nelson as a universal system for managing information. It was meant to be a way to link, track, and share documents in a more sophisticated and nuanced manner than the World Wide Web.
   - **Why It Didn’t Take Off:** Despite starting in 1960 and being ahead of its time, Project Xanadu faced repeated delays, over-engineering, and an inability to release a stable product. The World Wide Web launched in the interim and became the standard, leaving Xanadu a fascinating but largely irrelevant footnote in tech history.

9. **CrunchBang Linux (#!)**
   - **Description:** CrunchBang Linux was a lightweight Linux distribution based on Debian, known for its minimalistic, dark-themed interface and reliance on the Openbox window manager. It was designed to be fast, efficient, and highly customizable.
   - **Why It Didn’t Take Off:** While it had a dedicated user base, CrunchBang never attracted a broader audience. Its minimalist approach was appealing to Linux enthusiasts but wasn’t mainstream-friendly. The project was discontinued in 2015, though it lives on through community forks like BunsenLabs.

10. **Tailscale’s NetBSD-based Kubernetes Scheduler**
   - **Description:** This was an attempt to build a Kubernetes scheduler using NetBSD instead of Linux. The idea was to provide more compatibility and flexibility for network-focused tasks in the Kubernetes ecosystem.
   - **Why It Didn’t Take Off:** While NetBSD is known for its portability and network features, this approach didn’t gain traction because the Kubernetes community was (and is) deeply rooted in Linux. Most Kubernetes tools, extensions, and knowledge bases were built around Linux, making it impractical for users to switch.

### Conclusion
The open-source world is filled with creative, wacky, and sometimes visionary projects that, for various reasons, never gained widespread adoption. Whether due to technical limitations, niche appeal, or competition from more mainstream alternatives, these projects remain interesting examples of how the open-source community continues to push boundaries, even if not all ideas find success. Projects like **TempleOS** and **OpenMoko** demonstrate the risks and rewards of pursuing unconventional ideas, while **GNU Hurd** and **Project Xanadu** highlight how ambition can sometimes lead to overreach.
