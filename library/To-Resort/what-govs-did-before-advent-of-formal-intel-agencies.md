Summary of your prompt: You're asking what governments did before the development of formal intelligence agencies.

Before formal intelligence agencies were established, governments relied on more informal and ad-hoc methods of gathering intelligence. These methods often included:

1. Diplomatic Channels: Diplomats were frequently tasked with gathering information about the countries in which they were stationed. While their official roles involved negotiations and maintaining relations, many also acted as intelligence gatherers, reporting on military and political developments.


2. Military Scouts and Spies: Armies and navies employed scouts and spies during wartime to gain tactical information about enemy movements, fortifications, and plans. Spying was often done on an individual basis, with military commanders recruiting informants from enemy territories or sending soldiers to gather intelligence.


3. Mercenaries and Traders: Governments sometimes relied on mercenaries, traders, or other individuals who traveled between countries to collect intelligence. These individuals were well-placed to observe foreign political and economic conditions and report back.


4. Secret Police and Informants: In some cases, governments had early forms of secret police who maintained domestic order and tracked political dissidents. These organizations, like the Russian Okhrana (before it formalized), could also act in an intelligence capacity by gathering information on internal and external threats.


5. Ad-Hoc Networks: Monarchs and leaders sometimes established personal spy networks, often comprising trusted courtiers, nobles, or foreign contacts. These networks were usually informal and lacked the structured oversight of later intelligence agencies.


6. Interception of Communications: Even before modern technologies, governments would intercept letters and correspondence to gather intelligence. For instance, during the 17th and 18th centuries, European postmasters were sometimes instructed to open and read diplomatic mail to gather political intelligence.


7. Espionage Through Religious Orders or Organizations: In medieval and early modern times, the Catholic Church, particularly through the Jesuits and other religious orders, sometimes provided intelligence to monarchs. Religious figures, who were often trusted, could travel between regions and collect information.

In essence, early intelligence gathering was more fragmented, unorganized, and reliant on personal networks or the military's temporary needs. Governments saw the value of intelligence but lacked the formalized structures to systematically collect, analyze, and act on it until the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
