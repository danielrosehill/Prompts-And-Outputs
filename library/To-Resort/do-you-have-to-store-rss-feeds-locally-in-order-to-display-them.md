# Prompt

That seems like a very bad design. Presumably the database will fill up very quickly. Are there any self hostable rss tools that don't do this? Or is there no way to display an RSS feed without actually syndicating the content and storing it locally on the server?

# Output
The design of storing RSS feed data locally, as used by tools like **FreshRSS**, is common because it allows for features like **offline access**, **read/unread tracking**, and ensuring that articles remain available even if they are removed from the source. However, there are alternatives if you want a lighter solution that doesn't store feed data locally or only caches data temporarily.

### Why Do Most RSS Tools Store Content Locally?
Most RSS aggregators, including **self-hosted** ones, store content locally for the following reasons:
1. **Offline Access**: Users can access articles even when the original feed is unavailable or has removed the content.
2. **Tracking**: Storing content allows for tracking read/unread statuses, starred items, or other user-specific metadata.
3. **Speed**: Storing content locally makes displaying feeds faster because it doesn't require fetching each time from the original source.

### Alternatives to FreshRSS (or tools with different approaches):
Some tools can act more as **feed viewers** rather than **feed aggregators** that permanently store data. Here are some options:

### 1. **Tiny Tiny RSS** (TTRSS) with Caching Plugins
- **How it works**: **Tiny Tiny RSS** is similar to FreshRSS but offers plugins for **limiting stored articles** or purging them after a certain period, effectively working as a temporary cache.
- **Customization**: With plugins, you can configure TTRSS to remove articles from the database after reading or after a set amount of time.
- **Self-hosted**: Yes.
- **Storage**: You can configure how long data is stored (e.g., purge older articles regularly).

### 2. **Miniflux**
- **How it works**: **Miniflux** is another self-hosted RSS reader, designed to be lightweight and resource-efficient. It stores feed content locally but offers tools to limit storage usage.
- **Temporary storage**: You can set Miniflux to **automatically purge old content** after a specific period or after it's read.
- **Self-hosted**: Yes, and very lightweight.
- **Customization**: You can adjust the number of articles retained per feed.

### 3. **CommaFeed**
- **How it works**: **CommaFeed** is an open-source RSS reader that is lighter than FreshRSS. It stores articles but also allows for cleaning up after a certain period. You can configure it to behave more like a feed viewer.
- **Self-hosted**: Yes.
- **Lightweight**: CommaFeed offers a simplified interface and stores less metadata than FreshRSS, meaning fewer local storage requirements.
- **Customization**: Limited purging options, but better suited for users who want lighter storage.

### 4. **Self-Hosted RSS Viewers (without local storage)**
RSS **viewers** (as opposed to aggregators) don't store content but merely **display** it when the user loads the feed. These are more akin to how a browser fetches and renders pages.

- **Syndicated RSS Feeds via JavaScript**: If you're just looking for a way to **display RSS feeds** on a website without storing the data, you could use simple JavaScript-based tools that **syndicate content** directly from the feed source:
  - **RSS2HTML**: Converts RSS feed data into an HTML view for display. No local storage is required, as it fetches directly from the source.
  - **FeedWind**: A widget-based solution to display RSS feeds without storing the data. You can host similar widgets on your own infrastructure with a simple frontend tool.
  
These are closer to **RSS display widgets** and don’t retain data or offer features like offline reading or tracking.

### 5. **Feediron for Tiny Tiny RSS**
- **How it works**: **FeedIron** is a plugin for Tiny Tiny RSS that **does not store full articles**. Instead, it fetches and processes feed data as needed, similar to a content scraper, without permanently storing large amounts of data.
- **Use case**: If you're looking for something that syndicates content without the local storage, you can configure Feediron to behave more like a viewer than an aggregator.
- **Self-hosted**: Yes, with Tiny Tiny RSS.

### Is It Possible to Display RSS Feeds Without Storing Data?
Yes, it is technically possible, but with limitations:
- **RSS viewers** or **widgets** can fetch and display data from RSS feeds **without storing** the content locally, but you lose features like read/unread tracking, speed, and the ability to view content offline.
- **JavaScript widgets** or **PHP-based RSS renderers** can pull the content dynamically and display it directly on your website without saving it locally.

However, **without syndication (local storage)**, every page load would require fetching the feed again, which could slow things down and cause issues if the feed source is slow or unavailable.

### Conclusion:
- **Most self-hosted RSS readers**, like **FreshRSS**, store content locally because it enables features like offline access, article tracking, and fast performance.
- If you want a lighter tool, options like **Tiny Tiny RSS** or **Miniflux** offer the ability to limit how much data is stored, or to clear old data after a certain time.
- If you prefer a **pure viewer** that doesn't store any data locally, you can consider **JavaScript-based RSS renderers** or simple feed widgets that display live data without saving it.

For a self-hosted solution without significant storage, **Tiny Tiny RSS** with some customization (plugins or configuration for temporary storage) might be your best bet.
