# Prompt

Could you produce a summary of all the constraints in my current hardware that might guide upgrade decisions? For instance: what's the maximum storage that my motherboard can support? how many slots are there? What's the max RAM it could take? Etc. List as many constraints created by the components as you can identify

# Output

Based on the specs of your workstation, here are some constraints that might guide upgrade decisions for your hardware:

### CPU
- **Intel Core i7-12700F**
  - This processor uses the LGA 1700 socket. Ensure that any motherboard upgrade supports this socket type.
  - It supports up to **DDR5-4800** RAM, so any RAM upgrade should match this frequency or higher (if the motherboard can support faster speeds).

### Motherboard
- **Pro B760M-A WiFi (MSI B760 Chipset)**
  - **Max RAM**: This motherboard supports **up to 128GB** of DDR5 RAM across **4 DIMM slots**. Your current RAM configuration uses **32GB (2x16GB)**, so you have room for expansion.
  - **PCIe Slots**: The board has support for PCIe 5.0 on one x16 slot, meaning any future GPU upgrades can fully utilize modern cards.
  - **Storage Slots**: You currently have one NVMe SSD, and the motherboard supports additional NVMe storage through its M.2 slots (typically 2 slots).
  - **SATA Ports**: In addition to the NVMe drives, the motherboard has 4 SATA 6Gb/s ports for connecting additional SSDs or HDDs.
  - **Wi-Fi**: Built-in Wi-Fi, no immediate need for wireless network upgrades unless you're switching to a different connectivity standard.

### RAM
- **Kingston 32GB DDR5 4800MHz**
  - **Max RAM Frequency**: 4800MHz is supported by your current motherboard and CPU, but the motherboard might support higher frequencies through overclocking or newer modules.
  - You can expand up to **128GB total RAM** with available slots.

### GPU
- **AMD Radeon RX 7700 XT Pulse Gaming 12GB**
  - Your GPU occupies one PCIe x16 slot and supports modern games and tasks. The only constraint is physical size; make sure any upgrade fits in your case.
  - Power requirements (850W PSU) should handle any upgrade in the same class or slightly above.

### Power Supply
- **850W Seasonic SSR-850FX (Gold 80+)**
  - 850W is sufficient for most high-end GPUs and multiple storage drives. If upgrading to more powerful components (like higher-end GPUs), check the wattage requirement, but 850W is typically more than enough for most builds.

### Storage
- **Current Setup**: You have three storage devices totaling 2.73TB:
  - 1 NVMe SSD (931.51GB)
  - 2 SATA SSDs (929.93GB each)
  - **Storage Expansion**: You can add more SSDs using available M.2 or SATA slots, up to the motherboard's limits. If you need more storage, an upgrade to larger SSDs or additional NVMe drives is an option.

### Case and Cooling
- **Be Quiet Pure Base 500 (Model: BG034)**
  - **Size Constraints**: Your case is compatible with most GPUs and coolers, but if upgrading, be sure to check clearance for longer GPUs or larger coolers.
  - **Cooling**: You have a Pure Rock 2 CPU cooler, which is capable but might need an upgrade if overclocking or upgrading to a higher power CPU.

### Operating System
- **Fedora Workstation 40**: Ensure any new hardware (especially GPUs and SSDs) is compatible with Fedora Linux, though most modern components will be.

### Summary of Key Constraints
1. **Max RAM**: Your motherboard can take up to 128GB DDR5 across 4 slots.
2. **Storage**: Thereâ€™s room for additional NVMe or SATA drives.
3. **Power Supply**: 850W PSU is robust for most future upgrades.
4. **Cooling and Case Size**: Check clearance for larger GPUs or coolers if upgrading.
5. **Motherboard Expansion**: PCIe slots for additional cards and M.2 slots for more storage.
