To summarize: you're asking what **backup strategy** would put you in the **best position** to **quickly recover** your **Fedora system** in the event of a disk failure and loss of the OS.

### Best Case Backup Strategy for Quick Recovery

The ideal backup strategy for your Fedora system would include a combination of **full system backups** and **incremental backups**, with the ability to **restore the system to bare metal** quickly. The goal is to minimize downtime and manual reconfiguration while ensuring all your data, applications, and settings are restored.

### 1. **Full System Image Backup (Bare Metal Backup)**
   - **Description**: A **full system image** includes the entire operating system, configurations, applications, and data, allowing you to restore everything exactly as it was.
   - **Best Tools**: 
     - **Clonezilla**: For creating a full disk or partition image.
     - **Relax-and-Recover (ReaR)**: For creating a **bootable recovery image** and full system backup.
     - **Proxmox Backup Server (PBS)**: If you have multiple systems, Proxmox Backup Server offers incremental backups and bare metal restore options.

   **Why Useful**: In the event of a disk failure, you can boot from the backup media or recovery disk and restore your entire system, including the OS, to a new disk or machine. This is the fastest way to recover everything, including all settings and custom configurations.

   - **Frequency**: Perform a full image backup once a week or after significant system changes (e.g., updates, installations).

### 2. **Incremental Block-Level Backups**
   - **Description**: Incremental backups only save the changes made since the last backup. **Block-level backups** are more efficient as they only capture the changed blocks (not entire files), which can be done while the system is running.
   - **Best Tools**:
     - **Btrfs**: If you are using **Btrfs**, its native **snapshot** and **send/receive** capabilities can back up incrementally at the block level.
     - **Restic** or **BorgBackup**: For incremental, deduplicated, and encrypted backups of your file system.
     - **LVM Snapshots**: If you are using **LVM**, you can take periodic **LVM snapshots** and back them up.

   **Why Useful**: This ensures you have the latest state of your system without the overhead of creating full backups every time. In combination with a full image backup, incremental backups reduce backup time and storage needs while providing an up-to-date recovery point.

   - **Frequency**: Run incremental backups daily or more frequently, depending on how often your data changes.

### 3. **Separate /home and /data Backups**
   - **Description**: Regularly backing up the **/home** directory (or wherever your personal files and settings are stored) and any important **data directories** can ensure you don’t lose critical data in case of a failure.
   - **Best Tools**:
     - **rsync**: For a simple, efficient file-level backup.
     - **Restic**: For deduplicated, encrypted file backups.
     - **Duplicacy**: Another good option for deduplicated, encrypted backups.

   **Why Useful**: Even if the system itself is lost, having backups of personal data and settings (config files, scripts, etc.) ensures you can restore your working environment without needing to recover the entire system.

   - **Frequency**: Backup critical data multiple times per day if it changes frequently, or daily for personal files.

### 4. **Recovery Media (Bootable USB/DVD)**
   - **Description**: Keep a **bootable USB drive** or **recovery DVD** handy with tools like **ReaR** or a Fedora **Live CD** to quickly boot into a recovery environment.
   - **Best Tools**:
     - **ReaR**: Can create bootable recovery media that integrates with your backups.
     - **Fedora Live USB**: Useful for accessing the system and preparing for recovery.

   **Why Useful**: Having a bootable environment ready helps you quickly access your system to perform a restore after a disk failure, without needing to install Fedora manually first.

   - **Frequency**: Update this recovery media when you make significant system changes, such as upgrading Fedora versions or reconfiguring partitions.

### 5. **Automated Backup Schedules**
   - **Description**: Automate your full and incremental backups to ensure they happen regularly and without manual intervention.
   - **Best Tools**:
     - **Cron jobs**: For scheduling automated backups.
     - **systemd timers**: For more flexible scheduling.
     - **Amanda**: If you prefer a more managed backup system that supports both full and incremental backups.

   **Why Useful**: Automated backups ensure that your data is consistently saved and up-to-date without requiring you to remember to do it manually.

### Example Ideal Setup:
1. **Full Image Backup**: Use **Clonezilla** or **ReaR** once a week (or more frequently) to create a **bare metal backup**.
2. **Incremental Block-Level Backup**: Use **Restic**, **Btrfs snapshots**, or **BorgBackup** to back up the system’s block-level changes daily.
3. **Home/Data Backup**: Use **rsync** or **Restic** to back up personal files in `/home` or other important data directories several times a day.
4. **Recovery Media**: Keep a **Fedora Live USB** and **ReaR bootable media** available for quick recovery in case of a system failure.
5. **Automation**: Schedule these backups using **cron** or **systemd timers** to ensure regular execution.

### Summary:
The **best backup preparation** for a quick recovery after disk failure would involve:
- A **full system image backup** (via **Clonezilla** or **ReaR**) for **bare metal recovery**.
- **Incremental block-level backups** (via **Restic**, **Btrfs snapshots**, or **BorgBackup**) to keep your data up-to-date without frequent full backups.
- Separate **/home and data backups** for personal files.
- A **bootable recovery media** for accessing your system quickly.

This combination provides both **speed** and **flexibility** in restoring your system after a catastrophic disk failure.
