Yes, there is a way to take screenshots without the Night Light (blue light filter) effect in Fedora. Night Light is a color adjustment applied by the display system, so it affects what you see but not necessarily the raw data sent to the screen. 

Here are two methods:

1. **Disable Night Light Temporarily**: 
   - Go to **Settings > Display > Night Light** and toggle it off before taking the screenshot. This ensures your screenshot doesn't include the color filter.

2. **Use a Virtual Console**:
   - You can also switch to a different virtual console (e.g., using **Ctrl + Alt + F2**), take a screenshot there, and it won't capture the color adjustments from Night Light. 

Both methods should help you capture screenshots without any blue light filtering effects.
