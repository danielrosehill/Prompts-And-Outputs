Great news! The `df -h` output shows that your root filesystem (`/dev/mapper/ubuntu--vg-ubuntu--lv`) is now using the full **2TB** of space, with **1.9TB available**. 

This means the process has been successfully completed, and your system is now fully utilizing the allocated disk space.

### Summary of What We Did:
1. **Resized the partition** to use the full 2TB.
2. **Resized the physical volume** to recognize the extended partition.
3. **Extended the logical volume** to use all available space.
4. **Resized the filesystem** to take advantage of the expanded logical volume.

Your system is now fully utilizing the 2TB of disk space. If you need further help or encounter any other issues, feel free to ask!
