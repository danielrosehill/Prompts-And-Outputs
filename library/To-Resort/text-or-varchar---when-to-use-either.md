In PostgreSQL, both `TEXT` and `VARCHAR` types are used to store variable-length strings, but they have some differences:

*   `TEXT`: This type is essentially the same as `VARCHAR` with no length limit. It's generally used when you don't need to impose a specific maximum length on the string.
    
*   `VARCHAR(n)`: This type allows you to specify a maximum length (`n`). If you try to store a string longer than this length, PostgreSQL will throw an error.
    

In practice:

*   **Use** `TEXT` if you don't need to enforce a specific length constraint and want to avoid the overhead of checking length constraints.
    
*   **Use** `VARCHAR(n)` if you need to enforce a maximum length constraint on the data.
    

Performance-wise, there's typically no significant difference between the two for most use cases. However, `TEXT` is often preferred for its simplicity and flexibility unless you have a specific reason to enforce length constraints.
