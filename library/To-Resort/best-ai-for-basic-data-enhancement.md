# Prompt
I'm looking for an AI tool that would be able to take this guest list (for an event) and create a new column for guest details and derive those from public sources. Can you think of suitable tools?

# Output

Here are a few AI tools that could help you automatically populate a new column in your guest list with details derived from public sources:

1. **MonkeyLearn**: This tool allows you to extract data from text or enrich datasets by fetching additional information from public sources. You could integrate it with Google Sheets or Excel, and it could be configured to pull public data based on guest names.

2. **Clearbit**: Clearbit offers data enrichment for companies and individuals. You could use it to pull additional details such as job titles, companies, and professional bios based on the email addresses or names in your guest list.

3. **Zyte (formerly Scrapy Cloud)**: This tool helps with web scraping to derive data from public sources. You can automate the process of fetching details from publicly available websites based on the names in your guest list.

4. **People Data Labs**: This tool can enrich your guest list by pulling public information on individuals, including professional details, contact information, and more.

5. **Diffbot**: A tool specifically designed for extracting and structuring data from the web. You could set it up to derive public information about your guests and populate the guest list with those details.

6. **Clay**: Clay allows you to automatically enrich contact lists by pulling data from public sources, including LinkedIn, Twitter, and websites, making it a useful option for guest lists.

Any of these tools could be integrated with a spreadsheet to generate the additional guest details column. Does one of them sound suitable for your needs?## Extracted Prompts
