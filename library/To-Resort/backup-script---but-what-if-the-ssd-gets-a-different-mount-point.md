**Prompt summary:** You're asking if the SSD gets a random mount point every time it's plugged in and whether there's a way to modify the backup script to identify the correct device regardless of its mount point.

Yes, external drives can often get mounted to different paths, especially if auto-mounted by the system. Instead of relying on the random mount point, you can use the **UUID** of the SSD to ensure that the script always finds and uses the correct drive.

### Steps to Modify the Script for Consistent SSD Mounting:

1. **Identify the UUID of the SSD**:
   To ensure the script consistently identifies the correct drive, you'll use its **UUID** (Universally Unique Identifier). You can find the UUID of your SSD with the following command:
   ```bash
   sudo blkid /dev/sdc1
   ```

   The output will look something like this:
   ```bash
   /dev/sdc1: UUID="xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx" TYPE="btrfs"
   ```

   Copy the **UUID** value from this output, as you'll use it in your script.

2. **Modify the Script to Use the UUID**:
   In the script, instead of relying on a fixed mount point like `/run/media/daniel/Workstation`, you can mount the SSD using its UUID dynamically. Here's the updated version of your script:

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash

   # UUID of the external SSD
   SSD_UUID="xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"   # Replace with your SSD's UUID

   # Path where the SSD will be temporarily mounted
   MOUNT_POINT="/mnt/ssd_backup"

   # Subvolume paths
   ROOT_SUBVOLUME="/root"
   HOME_SUBVOLUME="$HOME"

   # Current date for snapshot naming
   CURRENT_DATE=$(date +%F)
   ROOT_SNAPSHOT="$MOUNT_POINT/daniel-workstation/root_snapshot_$CURRENT_DATE"
   HOME_SNAPSHOT="$MOUNT_POINT/daniel-workstation/home_snapshot_$CURRENT_DATE"

   # Previous snapshot paths (update manually to the most recent snapshot)
   PREVIOUS_ROOT_SNAPSHOT="$MOUNT_POINT/daniel-workstation/root_snapshot_PREVIOUS_DATE"
   PREVIOUS_HOME_SNAPSHOT="$MOUNT_POINT/daniel-workstation/home_snapshot_PREVIOUS_DATE"

   # Ensure the SSD is mounted
   if ! grep -qs "$MOUNT_POINT" /proc/mounts; then
       sudo mkdir -p $MOUNT_POINT
       sudo mount UUID=$SSD_UUID $MOUNT_POINT
   fi

   # Create new snapshots for root and home
   sudo btrfs subvolume snapshot $ROOT_SUBVOLUME $ROOT_SNAPSHOT
   sudo btrfs subvolume snapshot $HOME_SUBVOLUME $HOME_SNAPSHOT

   # Incremental backup for root subvolume
   if [ -d "$PREVIOUS_ROOT_SNAPSHOT" ]; then
       echo "Performing incremental backup for root..."
       sudo btrfs send -p $PREVIOUS_ROOT_SNAPSHOT $ROOT_SNAPSHOT | sudo btrfs receive $MOUNT_POINT/daniel-workstation/incremental-backups/
   else
       echo "No previous root snapshot found, performing full backup..."
       sudo btrfs send $ROOT_SNAPSHOT | sudo btrfs receive $MOUNT_POINT/daniel-workstation/incremental-backups/
   fi

   # Incremental backup for home subvolume
   if [ -d "$PREVIOUS_HOME_SNAPSHOT" ]; then
       echo "Performing incremental backup for home..."
       sudo btrfs send -p $PREVIOUS_HOME_SNAPSHOT $HOME_SNAPSHOT | sudo btrfs receive $MOUNT_POINT/daniel-workstation/incremental-backups/
   else
       echo "No previous home snapshot found, performing full backup..."
       sudo btrfs send $HOME_SNAPSHOT | sudo btrfs receive $MOUNT_POINT/daniel-workstation/incremental-backups/
   fi

   # Optional: Prune old snapshots, keeping the last 7 snapshots
   sudo btrfs subvolume delete $(ls -t $MOUNT_POINT/daniel-workstation/root_snapshot_* | tail -n +8)
   sudo btrfs subvolume delete $(ls -t $MOUNT_POINT/daniel-workstation/home_snapshot_* | tail -n +8)

   # Unmount the SSD
   sudo umount $MOUNT_POINT
   ```

### Key Modifications:

1. **Mounting the SSD by UUID**:
   - The script dynamically mounts the SSD using its UUID (`sudo mount UUID=$SSD_UUID $MOUNT_POINT`), ensuring it works regardless of where itâ€™s mounted by the system.
   - The SSD is mounted to a fixed directory (`/mnt/ssd_backup`) that you control, ensuring consistency in your script.

2. **Unmounting the SSD**:
   - After the backup is complete, the script unmounts the SSD (`sudo umount $MOUNT_POINT`) to avoid leaving it mounted unnecessarily.

3. **Previous Snapshots**:
   - Make sure to update the `PREVIOUS_ROOT_SNAPSHOT` and `PREVIOUS_HOME_SNAPSHOT` values with the correct paths from your last backup. You could automate this by storing the last backup date in a file, but for now, manual updates are required.

### To Test the Script:

1. **Update the UUID**:
   Replace the `SSD_UUID="xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"` line with your actual SSD UUID from the `blkid` command.

2. **Test the Script**:
   Run the script manually to ensure it works:
   ```bash
   ~/btrfs_incremental_backup.sh
   ```

3. **Schedule with Cron**:
   Once you're satisfied with the script, schedule it as before with cron:
   ```bash
   crontab -e
   ```

   Add the following line to run the script daily at midnight:
   ```bash
   0 0 * * * /home/daniel/btrfs_incremental_backup.sh
   ```

### Summary:

- **UUID-based mounting** ensures your script works no matter where the SSD is mounted.
- The script mounts the SSD to a specific directory (`/mnt/ssd_backup`), performs the backup, and unmounts it afterward.
- You now have a flexible and robust solution for automating your Btrfs incremental backups to the SSD.
