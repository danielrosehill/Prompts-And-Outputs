I'm protecting some local services with Cloudflare Tunnels. Is there any CLI that can be used to verify that the endpoints are properly secured? Ie, I'd like to try to connect to them through some random external IP?

# Output
Yes, you can use several command-line tools to verify that your services protected by **Cloudflare Tunnels** are properly secured. While Cloudflare Access will block unauthorized access to services, there isn't a specific Cloudflare CLI for testing this. However, you can simulate access to your services and endpoints through external IPs using some general tools.

Here’s how you can test the security of your Cloudflare Tunnel-protected services:

### 1. **`curl` Command for Testing HTTP(S) Access**
You can use the `curl` command to attempt to access your endpoints from the command line. When accessing services protected by **Cloudflare Access**, unauthorized requests should receive a **403 Forbidden** or **401 Unauthorized** response.

#### Example `curl` command:
```bash
curl -I https://your-protected-endpoint.example.com
```

- **`-I`**: Fetches only the headers (useful for checking the status code).
- Replace `https://your-protected-endpoint.example.com` with the actual URL of the service you want to test.

### Expected Response:
- If Cloudflare Access is properly protecting the service, the response will likely be **403 Forbidden** or **401 Unauthorized** because you're not authenticated.
  
#### Example Response:
```bash
HTTP/2 403 
date: Thu, 24 Oct 2024 14:53:28 GMT
content-type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
```

### 2. **Simulate Access from a Different IP Using a Proxy**
To simulate accessing your service from an external IP (outside your network), you can use a **proxy** service such as a VPN, cloud instance (e.g., AWS EC2), or a public proxy. This will allow you to test what happens when someone tries to access the endpoint from an external location.

#### Option 1: Using a Free Proxy (via `curl`):
You can use a free public proxy to simulate an external IP address.

```bash
curl -I --proxy http://<proxy-ip>:<port> https://your-protected-endpoint.example.com
```

This command tries to access the protected endpoint using a proxy. Replace `<proxy-ip>` and `<port>` with the IP address and port of the proxy you are using.

#### Option 2: Using a VPN or Cloud Instance:
If you have access to a VPN or a cloud server, you can SSH into the cloud instance or connect via VPN and run the `curl` command from there to simulate external access.

### 3. **Use `httpie` for Testing RESTful APIs**
If your endpoints provide APIs, you can use **`httpie`**, a user-friendly HTTP client that provides color-coded output. It is similar to `curl` but easier to read.

#### Installation:
```bash
sudo dnf install httpie
```

#### Usage:
```bash
http https://your-protected-endpoint.example.com
```

Like with `curl`, the response should show an **HTTP 403** or **401** error if the service is properly secured.

### 4. **`nmap` for Scanning Ports**
If you want to check whether specific ports on your services are externally accessible, you can use **`nmap`** to scan for open ports.

#### Example `nmap` Command:
```bash
nmap -Pn your-protected-endpoint.example.com
```

This will tell you whether any open ports are visible externally. For Cloudflare Tunnel-protected services, you generally shouldn’t see open ports because the services are routed through Cloudflare.

### 5. **Use Cloudflare Access Audit Logs**
Although not a CLI tool, you can also verify that endpoints are secured by reviewing the **Cloudflare Access logs** in the Cloudflare dashboard:

- Go to **Cloudflare Dashboard > Access > Logs**.
- Check if there are any unauthorized access attempts.
- You can also see successful logins and the identity provider used (e.g., Google, GitHub).

### Summary of CLI Tools:
1. **`curl`**: To test access to the service directly and check the HTTP response code (403 or 401 expected).
2. **Proxy or VPN**: Simulate accessing the service from an external IP address.
3. **`httpie`**: Similar to `curl` but easier to read for API endpoints.
4. **`nmap`**: To check whether any ports are exposed externally.

These tools allow you to simulate external access and check whether the services are protected as expected. Let me know if you need more detailed steps or assistance with one of these methods!
