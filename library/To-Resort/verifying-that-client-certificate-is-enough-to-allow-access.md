Yes, once you’ve installed the **client certificate** on your Android device, and assuming you’ve correctly configured **Cloudflare Access** to trust client certificates via **mutual TLS (mTLS)**, **you should not be challenged** when trying to connect from that phone.

Here's what will happen:
1. When you attempt to access a Cloudflare Access-protected resource, your Android device will automatically present the installed client certificate.
2. **Cloudflare Access**, configured to trust that certificate, will authenticate the device without requiring additional login (such as SSO or email-based challenges).
3. As long as the client certificate is valid and correctly trusted, Cloudflare will bypass further authentication, granting you seamless access to the protected resource.

### Verifying No Authentication Challenge:
- **Try accessing one of your protected resources** (e.g., `ha.testhomewebsite.com`) from your Android phone.
- If everything is configured correctly (mTLS on Cloudflare, client certificate installed), you should directly access the resource without being prompted for authentication.
  
### Troubleshooting:
If you are still getting prompted for authentication:
1. **Check mTLS Configuration**: Ensure mTLS is enabled and correctly configured in **Cloudflare > SSL/TLS > Client Certificates**.
2. **Ensure the Correct Certificate**: Verify that the correct certificate is installed on your Android phone and was signed by the CA that Cloudflare trusts.
3. **Access Policies**: Double-check your Cloudflare Access policies to ensure the rule that allows bypassing for client certificates is properly set up.

Once all is in place, your Android phone will no longer need to go through the standard authentication process for the resources protected by Cloudflare Access.
