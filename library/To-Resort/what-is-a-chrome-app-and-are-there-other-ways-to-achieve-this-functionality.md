# Prompt

I use a Chrome App to access ChatGPT from my desktop (Fedora Linux, KDE Plasma, Wayland). What is a Chrome App in reality? And are there alternative ways to get the same functionality?

# Output

You're correct that what you're using is likely a **Progressive Web App (PWA)** if you're accessing ChatGPT through Chrome's "Install as app" button. **PWAs** are not being phased out—in fact, they're increasingly becoming the preferred method for delivering web apps that can behave like native apps across platforms.

Google has phased out **Chrome Apps** (which were a different, older system), but **PWAs** are very much supported and actively encouraged as the modern replacement. PWAs offer many advantages, such as offline capabilities, push notifications, and the ability to run in a standalone window. They also work across different browsers and platforms, making them a more versatile solution compared to Chrome Apps.

So, your use of a PWA for ChatGPT is safe and fully supported for the foreseeable future!

# Input

Okay. So I'm using a PWA. Back to the question, then. Is there a way to get this functionality through a different mechanism?

# Output

Yes, there are several alternative ways to achieve the same functionality as a Progressive Web App (PWA) for accessing ChatGPT, using different mechanisms. Here are the options:

### 1. **Web Shortcuts in Any Browser**:
   - You can create a shortcut to ChatGPT in any web browser, and configure it to open in its own window. This would give it a more app-like experience, even though it's technically running inside the browser.
   - **In Chrome/Chromium**: Click the three dots > "More Tools" > "Create Shortcut" > Check "Open as window."
   - **In Firefox**: Use the "Install Site as App" feature via the `about:config` page (requires additional setup).
   - **In Edge**: Microsoft Edge has similar functionality under "Apps" > "Install this site as an app."

### 2. **Electron-Based Desktop Apps**:
   - **Electron** allows developers to package web apps as desktop applications. Some developers have built Electron-based apps for ChatGPT or similar services, which are available on GitHub or other software repositories. These apps provide a native-like experience with features such as notifications and offline usage.
   - **Examples**:
     - Look for unofficial ChatGPT clients based on Electron, which function like desktop apps but are cross-platform.

### 3. **Native Desktop Apps**:
   - While OpenAI does not currently offer an official desktop client for ChatGPT, third-party developers may offer native apps for Linux, often built on Electron or similar frameworks. These would behave like full desktop applications, separate from your browser.
   - **GitHub** or software repositories may list such projects, often providing cross-platform compatibility, including Linux.

### 4. **Browser Extensions**:
   - You could use browser extensions that integrate ChatGPT functionality directly within your browser. This might not replicate the standalone "app" experience but could provide quick access to ChatGPT without leaving your current browser window.

### 5. **KDE Plasma WebApp Integration (Linux-specific)**:
   - If you are using KDE Plasma (which you are), it offers a **WebApp Manager** tool that can convert any website into a standalone application. This can be done without relying on Chrome’s PWA functionality.
   - You can use **Nativefier** to create a standalone desktop application from any website, which works well on KDE Plasma and other Linux desktop environments. This offers an experience similar to an Electron app but is built specifically for Linux.

Each of these methods offers a similar "app-like" experience to what you are getting with PWAs, depending on your preferred level of integration and platform needs.
