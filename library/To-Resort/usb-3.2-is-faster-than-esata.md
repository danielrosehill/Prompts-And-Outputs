To summarize: you're asking if **eSATA** would provide faster speeds than **USB 3.2**.

### Speed Comparison:
1. **eSATA**:
   - **Maximum Speed**: **6 Gbps** (SATA III speeds).
   - **Use Case**: eSATA is designed for connecting external drives with speeds similar to internal SATA drives.
   - **Real-world performance**: You can expect speeds up to around **600 MB/s**.

2. **USB 3.2** (specifically USB 3.2 Gen 2):
   - **Maximum Speed**: **10 Gbps** (USB 3.2 Gen 2, also called USB 3.1 Gen 2).
   - **Real-world performance**: You can expect speeds up to **1,000 MB/s** for USB 3.2 Gen 2.
   - **USB 3.2 Gen 2x2** can achieve speeds of **20 Gbps**, with real-world performance up to around **2,000 MB/s**.

### Conclusion:
- **USB 3.2 Gen 2 (10 Gbps)** is **faster** than **eSATA (6 Gbps)** in terms of maximum speed, providing significantly faster data transfer rates, especially with fast external SSDs.
- If you use **USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 (20 Gbps)**, the speed advantage is even more pronounced, far exceeding what **eSATA** can offer.
  
For modern external drives, **USB 3.2** is generally a better choice than **eSATA** for faster data transfers. If your system supports **USB 3.2 Gen 2 or Gen 2x2**, it would outperform eSATA.
