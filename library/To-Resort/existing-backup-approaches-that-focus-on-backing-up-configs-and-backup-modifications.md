# Prompt

Can you think of any existing backup programme which comes closest to using my proposed methodology as its default way of achieving backups? 

# Output

Your proposed methodology is quite specific, focusing on tracking incremental changes to system configuration and installed packages rather than traditional file-based backups. While no backup program mirrors this approach exactly, there are some tools that share certain elements of it. These programs focus on configuration management, system snapshots, or package tracking, and can be adapted to meet your needs:

### 1. **etckeeper**
   - **Purpose**: Tracks changes in `/etc/` using version control (Git, Mercurial, etc.), which can be useful for tracking configuration changes over time.
   - **How it Relates**: While it doesn't directly track DNF or pip packages, you could extend it to manage configuration files that are edited during package installs. Since it uses Git, it allows for incremental tracking and rollbacks of configuration changes.
   - **Adaptation**: You could create hooks to include other types of changes you care about (like DNF packages or pip installs) by using pre- or post-commit hooks.

### 2. **NixOS (or Nix Package Manager for Fedora)**
   - **Purpose**: Nix tracks exact versions of installed packages and configuration in a declarative manner, allowing reproducibility of environments.
   - **How it Relates**: Nix is designed to create reproducible builds of systems. You declare your entire system's configuration (packages, services, etc.) in a configuration file, and Nix ensures that exact environment is recreated.
   - **Adaptation**: Nix captures your exact system state, and if you switch to using it (or just the package manager), it could achieve much of what you want. You can write the changes in the Nix configuration format, then apply them to any system, which would handle the incremental approach by default.

### 3. **Home Manager (for Nix)**
   - **Purpose**: Manages user-specific configurations, including installed packages and services, via declarative files.
   - **How it Relates**: It allows you to specify your home directory environment in a way that can be reproduced. This includes the installed programs, services, and configurations at the user level. 
   - **Adaptation**: You would write out your system and user configuration once, and Home Manager would maintain incremental changes via configuration files.

### 4. **GNU Stow**
   - **Purpose**: A symlink manager that manages package installations and configurations under a specific directory structure.
   - **How it Relates**: While not a "backup" tool, it organizes configurations into version-controlled directories, allowing for easier replication and rollbacks. You could stow different system components (like DNF packages, pip installs, etc.) in a similar way.
   - **Adaptation**: Use Stow in combination with Git to manage the configurations and package lists you want to track. Each change would be an incremental commit in your version control.

### 5. **YADM (Yet Another Dotfiles Manager)**
   - **Purpose**: A dotfiles manager that tracks user configurations in Git.
   - **How it Relates**: This manages dotfiles (personal configuration files) and can be used to version control and sync them across machines. It has incremental backups since Git is the underlying system.
   - **Adaptation**: You could adapt it to manage more than just dotfiles (like your package lists) by storing them in version control and using YADM to sync the changes across systems.

### 6. **BorgBackup (with a twist)**
   - **Purpose**: A traditional backup tool that creates deduplicated, incremental backups.
   - **How it Relates**: While BorgBackup is primarily designed for file backups, it supports incremental backups by default. You could write scripts to use Borg to back up your list of DNF packages, pip installs, etc., then store the incremental changes in a deduplicated way.
   - **Adaptation**: Use BorgBackup alongside your scripts for package tracking, and back up only the package lists and configurations, not the full filesystem.

### 7. **Aptik**
   - **Purpose**: A tool designed for migrating Linux installations. It backs up software, PPA repositories, and other configurations.
   - **How it Relates**: Aptik backs up system packages, repositories, and settings but focuses on file-based backups of package lists. It is not incremental, but you could modify it to store differences over time.
   - **Adaptation**: While Aptik doesn't offer Git-like incremental tracking, it can be a useful tool to back up packages and repositories. You could script around it to manage incremental updates more effectively.

### 8. **chezmoi**
   - **Purpose**: A dotfile management tool for securely managing personal configuration files across multiple machines.
   - **How it Relates**: It allows for managing and syncing configuration files, with an emphasis on security and reproducibility. It could help track and version control any changes to your configurations over time, somewhat like Ansible but more focused on dotfiles.
   - **Adaptation**: Use it to manage and track the incremental changes to your configuration files and any custom scripts for package management.

### **Recommendation**:
Given your specific requirements for tracking changes to installed packages and system configurations, hereâ€™s how you could adapt a hybrid solution:
1. **Use `etckeeper`** to track `/etc/` and any repository changes.
2. **Use a combination of bash scripts** (like the incremental script we discussed) to track installed packages and configuration changes, and manage them in a Git repo for version control.
3. If you want a more advanced solution, explore **Nix** for managing the entire environment declaratively, which inherently tracks the configuration incrementally.
