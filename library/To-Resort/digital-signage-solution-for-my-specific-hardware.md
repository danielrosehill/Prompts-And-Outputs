# Prompt

Here's my setup: I have a local Ubuntu server that I could use to host a dashboard or signage server. My TV is connected to an Ubuntu mini PC. I also have an Android tablet. Both the Android tablet and the TV might be useful for displaying monitoring dashboards of news channels and security alerts. A centralised management platform that would allow me to create individual links for dashboards to show on my TV and Android would probably be the ideal solution. I'm happy to self host or use a managed solution which doesn't require deploying additional hardware. With that additional context in mind, can you suggest any tools that might be good fits?
