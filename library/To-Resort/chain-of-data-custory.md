# Prompt

what would you call including documentation from an original dataset for the sake of completeness in posting a derived database. I would call it showing a chain of data custody.

# Outuput
Including documentation from the original dataset when posting a derived database can be referred to as maintaining **data provenance** or establishing a **chain of data custody**. This concept ensures transparency and accountability by documenting the sources, transformations, and handling of the data throughout its lifecycle.

### Terminology Breakdown:
1. **Data Provenance**: This refers to the detailed history of how data has been collected, transformed, and processed. Including original documentation helps users understand the origin and reliability of the dataset.
   
2. **Chain of Data Custody**: Similar to how legal custody chains track the handling of physical evidence, this phrase applies to data by ensuring that the data’s history is traceable from its original source through all transformations and derivations.

By providing the original dataset’s documentation, you ensure that anyone reviewing your derived database can trace the data’s origins, understand the transformations it underwent, and verify its integrity and reliability. This enhances trust in your published work.
