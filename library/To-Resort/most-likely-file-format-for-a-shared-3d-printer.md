# Prompt

I'm pretty sure that there's a design school locally that has a 3d printer which you can pay to use. I'll look up the specs eventually but ... what's the most likely file format they would be looking for and what could I use on Fedora to try make a couple of test design projects?

# Output

The most likely file format the design school would require is **STL**. This is the industry standard for 3D printing and is supported by nearly all 3D printers. Occasionally, they might accept **OBJ** files, especially if your model includes textures or complex surface details, but STL is almost always the default.

### **Software on Fedora for Designing Your Test Projects**:
Here are some Fedora-compatible tools to create 3D designs and export them as STL files:

1. **Blender**:
   - **Best for**: Advanced 3D modeling, artistic projects, and intricate designs.
   - **How to use**: You can create a 3D model in Blender and then export it as an STL file.
     - **Export STL**: After modeling, go to `File > Export > STL (.stl)` to save your file.
   - **Installation**: Install via the Fedora repositories:
     ```bash
     sudo dnf install blender
     ```

2. **FreeCAD**:
   - **Best for**: Parametric design, mechanical parts, and more structured models (similar to CAD software).
   - **How to use**: Design the model in FreeCAD and then export it as an STL file.
     - **Export STL**: Go to `File > Export` and choose `.stl` as the file format.
   - **Installation**: Available in Fedora repositories:
     ```bash
     sudo dnf install freecad
     ```

3. **Tinkercad** (Web-based):
   - **Best for**: Simple, beginner-friendly 3D modeling.
   - **How to use**: Tinkercad is a browser-based tool that works on any OS, including Fedora. You can design basic models online and export them as STL files.
   - **Access**: Just visit [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/) and create designs in your web browser.

4. **OpenSCAD**:
   - **Best for**: Programmatic and mathematical design of 3D models.
   - **How to use**: OpenSCAD allows you to define 3D shapes using code. You can export your models to STL for printing.
     - **Export STL**: After completing the model, go to `File > Export > Export as STL`.
   - **Installation**: Install via Fedora repositories:
     ```bash
     sudo dnf install openscad
     ```

### **Recommended Approach**:
- **Blender** or **FreeCAD** are great choices for trying out test projects, depending on whether you want a more artistic (Blender) or structured (FreeCAD) approach to design.
- After designing, export your file as **STL**, which is the most universally accepted format for 3D printers.
- You can always check the design school's specific file format requirements, but in almost all cases, **STL** will be what they expect.
