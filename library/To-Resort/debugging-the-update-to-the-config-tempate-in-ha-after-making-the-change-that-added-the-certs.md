Yes, if the problem started after you made changes to the **HTTP section** in **configuration.yaml**, it's possible that there is a misconfiguration that is preventing **Home Assistant** from starting properly or listening on **port 8123**. You can absolutely fix or revert those changes from the terminal by editing **configuration.yaml** directly.

Here's how to proceed to revert or fix the changes:

### **1. SSH into Home Assistant Host**
First, **SSH** into the Home Assistant instance. If SSH is enabled, run:

```bash
ssh root@192.168.1.3
```

If SSH is not enabled, you might need to access the console directly via a monitor and keyboard connected to the machine.

### **2. Navigate to the Configuration File**
The **configuration.yaml** file is usually located in the **config directory** of your Home Assistant installation. To access the file:

```bash
cd /config
```

### **3. Edit `configuration.yaml`**
Open **configuration.yaml** with a text editor like **nano** or **vi**:

```bash
nano configuration.yaml
```
Or, if **vi** is installed:

```bash
vi configuration.yaml
```

### **4. Locate the HTTP Section and Revert Changes**
Look for the **HTTP** section that you modified. It will usually look something like this:

```yaml
http:
  server_port: 8123  # This sets the port Home Assistant listens on
  ssl_certificate: /path/to/fullchain.pem  # For SSL configuration
  ssl_key: /path/to/privkey.pem            # For SSL configuration
```

- **Check for Typos or Errors**: Make sure there are no mistakes, incorrect indentation, or misconfigurations that could cause **Home Assistant** to fail to start.
- If you added an **SSL configuration** but didn’t set up the certificates properly, it might prevent Home Assistant from starting.
- If you are unsure, simply **remove the entire HTTP section** to revert to the default settings.

### **5. Save and Exit the Editor**
- If you’re using **nano**:
  - **Save**: Press `CTRL + O`, then press `Enter`.
  - **Exit**: Press `CTRL + X`.

- If you’re using **vi**:
  - Press `Esc`, then type `:wq` and press **Enter** to save and exit.

### **6. Validate the Configuration**
It’s always a good idea to validate the configuration before restarting to ensure there are no issues.

- **Run Configuration Check**:
  ```bash
  ha core check
  ```
  - This command will let you know if there are any syntax errors or misconfigurations in **configuration.yaml**.

### **7. Restart Home Assistant**
After fixing or removing the **HTTP** section, restart Home Assistant to apply the changes.

- **Restart Core**:
  ```bash
  ha core restart
  ```

### **8. Check Logs if Errors Persist**
If the issue still persists, check the **Home Assistant logs** for more specific error messages:

```bash
ha core logs
```
Look for any references to configuration errors, issues with the HTTP settings, or anything preventing Home Assistant from listening on **port 8123**.

### **9. Example of Default HTTP Configuration**
If you want to restore a basic **HTTP** configuration, you can use the following default:

```yaml
http:
  server_port: 8123
```
- **Remove SSL-related entries** unless you have properly configured the certificates.

### **Possible Causes of the Issue**:
- **Incorrect Indentation**: YAML is sensitive to whitespace, so incorrect indentation can cause configuration errors.
- **SSL Misconfiguration**: If you added paths to SSL certificates that do not exist or are incorrectly formatted, it could prevent **Home Assistant** from starting.
- **Incorrect Port**: If you changed the **port number**, and that port is blocked by a firewall or already in use by another service, **Home Assistant** may fail to bind to that port.

### **Summary Steps**:
1. **SSH into Home Assistant** (`ssh root@192.168.1.3`).
2. Navigate to `/config` and open **configuration.yaml** (`nano configuration.yaml`).
3. **Locate the HTTP section**, correct any errors, or **remove it** entirely to reset to default.
4. **Save and exit** the editor.
5. Run **`ha core check`** to validate the configuration.
6. **Restart Home Assistant** (`ha core restart`).
7. **Check logs** (`ha core logs`) if the issue persists.

This should help you get **Home Assistant** back up and running. Let me know if you need any more detailed help on any step!
