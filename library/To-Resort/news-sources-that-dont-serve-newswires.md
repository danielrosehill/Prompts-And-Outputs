# Output

Yes, there are some news websites and newswires that prioritize a clean, minimalistic layout with minimal advertising. These are often subscription-based services or newswires, which typically avoid intrusive banner ads in favor of an uninterrupted news-reading experience. Here are some options focused on news from Israel that should provide a cleaner, less intrusive display:

### 1. **Reuters Middle East** 
   - URL: [https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/)
   - Reuters is a global newswire service known for a clean and professional layout. It generally avoids intrusive ads, particularly in its newswire sections. Their Middle East section covers news from Israel and the region without pop-ups or banner ads.

### 2. **The Times of Israel (Premium Subscription)**
   - URL: [https://www.timesofisrael.com/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/)
   - While the free version includes ads, the Times of Israel offers a premium ad-free subscription. This version provides a clean interface ideal for displays, focusing solely on content without intrusive advertising.

### 3. **Israel Hayom (Minimal Ads)**
   - URL: [https://www.israelhayom.com/](https://www.israelhayom.com/)
   - Israel Hayom provides a relatively clean layout with fewer banner ads. Although it has some ads, they are generally less intrusive compared to other major news outlets. It’s a good option if you’re looking for Israeli news with minimal distractions.

### 4. **Jewish Telegraphic Agency (JTA)**
   - URL: [https://www.jta.org/](https://www.jta.org/)
   - JTA is a newswire service that covers Jewish and Israeli news globally. The website is quite minimalistic and avoids flashy or intrusive ads. It’s well-suited for clean displays focusing on Jewish and Israeli news content.

### 5. **The Associated Press (AP) Middle East**
   - URL: [https://apnews.com/hub/middle-east](https://apnews.com/hub/middle-east)
   - AP’s website is designed for straightforward news delivery without heavy advertising. It’s a reliable source for Israel and Middle Eastern news and provides a clean, professional interface free from intrusive ads.

For a completely ad-free experience, the premium or subscription-based options like Times of Israel’s ad-free version are the most reliable. Otherwise, wire services like Reuters and AP generally maintain a minimalist and less ad-heavy environment, making them suitable for clean visual displays.
