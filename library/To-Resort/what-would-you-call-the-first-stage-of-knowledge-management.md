# Prompt

I have found that an essential part of knowledge management is getting information out of our heads and onto the page. Such information can then be managed and reorganised and reshaped. But there are no shortcuts for the first step.

What would you call this first "step" in the process? And can you think of any workflows that might provide an open ended framework intended to capture knowledge and thoughts?

# Output
The first "step" in the knowledge management process could be called **"Externalization"** or **"Knowledge Capture."** This stage focuses on getting thoughts, ideas, and information out of your head and onto a medium where they can be organized and refined.

### Open-Ended Frameworks for Knowledge Capture:
1. **Daily Brain Dump**:
   - Spend a set amount of time each morning or evening writing down everything on your mind. This helps clear mental clutter and externalizes ideas for later processing.

2. **Stream-of-Consciousness Journaling**:
   - Use freewriting techniques to capture spontaneous thoughts without worrying about structure. Tools like **Obsidian** or **Notion** can help organize these entries later.

3. **Mind Maps**:
   - Start with a central idea and branch out. This visual approach helps capture complex ideas and connections quickly.

4. **Inbox-Based Workflow**:
   - Maintain a digital or physical "inbox" where you jot down thoughts, ideas, and tasks as they arise. Periodically review and sort this content.

These methods encourage capturing raw information, making it easier to organize and refine later.
