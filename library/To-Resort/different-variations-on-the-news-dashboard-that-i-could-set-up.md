     - **Shelter Locations**: Display locations of public shelters or safe zones across Israel, especially in areas frequently targeted by rocket fire.
   - **Visualization Ideas**:
     - **Heatmaps for Traffic**: Real-time traffic congestion maps using Grafana’s **Geo plugin**.
     - **Alert Severity Indicators**: Gauge panels that show the severity of various alerts (weather, rockets, etc.).

### **3. Economic and Market Impact Dashboard**
   - **Focus**: Monitor economic and market impact in Israel during times of geopolitical tension.
   - **New Data Sources**:

### **4. Social Sentiment Dashboard**

     - **Reddit and Forums**: Gather data from specific threads and forums discussing regional events.

     - **Sentiment Over Time**: Graph sentiment (positive, neutral, negative) over time to correlate public sentiment with major events.
     - **Map Sentiment by Region**: If there is geo-tagged social media data, visualize it geographically to see how sentiment varies by region.

### **5. Historical Context Dashboard**

   - **New Data Sources**:
     - **Historical Incident Data**: Use historical records of past conflicts or incidents to give context.
     - **UN Reports or News Archives**: Pull data from open-source repositories.

     - **Event Frequency Heatmap**: Show how frequently similar events have occurred across different months or years.

### **6. International Diplomacy and Media Monitoring Dashboard**
   - **Focus**: Track how international media and diplomatic efforts are responding to events in Israel.

     - **Community-Specific Indicators**: Allow users to filter information to focus only on data relevant to their locality.

### **Technical Considerations for Grafana Dashboards**:
- **Grafana Plugins**: Utilize the **Worldmap Panel**, **Discrete Panel** for timelines, and **Pie Chart Panel** to effectively convey different data points.
- **Data Sources**: Use **Prometheus**, **InfluxDB**, or other time-series databases, depending on data collection frequency and volume.
- **Annotations**: Use Grafana’s **annotation** feature to mark significant events or alerts, providing historical context directly within the dashboard.

### **General Recommendations**:
- **User-Specific Dashboards**: Allow users to personalize their experience by selecting only the types of information that are most relevant to them (e.g., security, economics, social sentiment).
- **Public Sharing Considerations**: If you’re planning to make these dashboards public, ensure data privacy where necessary, especially with any social media data or private information.

These different versions of the dashboard would provide varied perspectives on developments in Israel, appealing to different user groups—those interested in security, the economy, social dynamics, or even local communities. Each dashboard version can serve different audiences while providing a valuable way to visualize and understand complex ongoing events.
