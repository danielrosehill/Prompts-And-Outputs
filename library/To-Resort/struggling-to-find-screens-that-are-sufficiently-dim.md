Your prompt asks if you're alone in finding most monitors too bright, even on their lowest settings, and struggling to find dim enough monitors for comfort.

You are **not alone** in feeling that most monitors are too bright, even at their lowest settings. Many people experience **sensitivity to brightness**, especially those with conditions like **light sensitivity (photophobia)**, **migraine sufferers**, or those prone to **digital eye strain**. It's also common among individuals who spend long hours in front of screens or have **sensory sensitivities**.

### Why Monitors Feel Too Bright:
1. **Modern Monitors are Designed for Brightness**:
   - Manufacturers often design monitors with high brightness settings to enhance clarity, especially in brightly lit environments. This can be uncomfortable for users in **dimly lit rooms** or those sensitive to brightness.

2. **Eye Sensitivity to Brightness**:
   - Individuals with **light sensitivity** or **dry eyes** may find that typical brightness levels are uncomfortable. Screens that are too bright can cause eye strain, discomfort, and fatigue over time.

3. **Backlight Technology**:
   - Some monitors use **LED backlighting**, which can emit very bright light, even at low brightness settings. This can make it difficult for people sensitive to light to find a comfortable setting.

### Solutions to Consider:
1. **Monitor with a Lower Minimum Brightness**:
   - Some manufacturers prioritize **eye health** and offer monitors that can be dimmed significantly lower than standard models. Brands like **BenQ**, **ASUS**, and **ViewSonic** offer monitors with features like **low blue light** and **brightness intelligence** technology that automatically adjusts to ambient light levels.

2. **Third-Party Software Solutions**:
   - You can use software like **f.lux** or **Iris** that allows for greater control over brightness and color temperature beyond what your monitor’s built-in settings allow. These programs adjust the screen’s brightness and warmth automatically based on the time of day.
   - For Linux users, there’s **Redshift**, which can also reduce brightness beyond the hardware settings.

3. **Physical Monitor Filters**:
   - A **physical filter** or **matte screen protector** can help reduce the brightness and glare of your monitor by adding a layer that diffuses the light.

4. **Adjusting Ambient Lighting**:
   - You can try lowering the overall brightness in your room to match your monitor's brightness better. **Dimmer room lighting** can make a slightly brighter screen feel more comfortable.

### Eye Care and Ergonomics:
If bright monitors cause significant discomfort, consider the following eye care tips:
- **Blink often** and take regular breaks to rest your eyes.
- Consider using **glasses with a tint** that reduces light sensitivity, such as **FL-41 lenses**, which might help make the brightness more tolerable.
  
### Conclusion:
You are certainly not alone, and sensitivity to brightness is a common issue. Luckily, there are solutions and monitor brands that cater to users who require lower brightness settings. If you're frequently struggling, it might be worthwhile to explore these software and hardware options to find a setup that's comfortable for you.
