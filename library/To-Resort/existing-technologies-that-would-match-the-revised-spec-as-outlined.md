# Prompt

Let's pick up on point 4 - existing tools. Can you think of any other tools that would really capture most of these features and save me having to build this myself?

# Output

Absolutely! Leveraging **existing tools** could save you a lot of development time and bring you very close to achieving the functionality you're envisioning without having to reinvent the wheel. Let’s explore a few existing platforms and tools that could provide much of the functionality you need:

### 1. **Notion**
   - **Features**: **Notion** is a very versatile **all-in-one workspace** that can handle **note-taking, task management, databases**, and more. It has a rich set of features for organizing information and can be used for:
     - **Context Library**: You could use Notion databases to store **context snippets** with tags for easy retrieval.
     - **Prompts and Outputs**: Set up different pages or databases for **prompts and outputs**, and link between them for easy reference.
   - **Integration with AI**: Notion also has an **API** that allows integration with other tools. Using tools like **Zapier** or **Make.com**, you could potentially trigger actions in Notion from other services, such as saving a response from ChatGPT directly into Notion.
   - **Mobile View**: Notion offers an **excellent mobile experience**, making it easy to review outputs on the go.

### 2. **Airtable**
   - **Features**: **Airtable** is like a **spreadsheet-database hybrid** that is powerful for organizing and retrieving information:
     - Use **Airtable databases** to store **context snippets, prompts**, and **outputs**, with an easy **tagging** and **filtering** mechanism.
     - **Views** can be customized to create a clean mobile experience, which is handy for when you're on the move.
   - **Automation**: Airtable also integrates well with automation tools like **Zapier**, allowing you to build workflows that connect your **ChatGPT responses** with your databases.
   - **Integration Possibility**: You can use **Airtable API** to integrate with a front-end chat interface or use no-code solutions to handle part of the integration.

### 3. **Coda**
   - **Features**: **Coda** is similar to **Notion** but offers greater **database flexibility** and built-in **automation** called "Packs."
     - You can create tables that store **context snippets, prompts, and outputs**.
     - It has built-in functionality to create **button actions** and automation (through "Packs") that can help trigger workflows.
   - **Integrated AI**: Coda has a feature called **Coda AI**, which can also perform AI-based document tasks, making it useful for generating and handling outputs directly in the same workspace.

### 4. **Trello or Asana with Power-Ups**
   - **Features**: Tools like **Trello** or **Asana** can be used creatively to manage different parts of your system:
     - Set up **boards/lists** to manage **context snippets, prompts, and outputs**.
     - **Power-Ups/Integrations**: Trello has Power-Ups, like **Unito** and **Zapier**, that can integrate external services, allowing you to automatically move content between your Trello boards and other apps.
   - **Limitations**: These tools are less database-driven and might not have the exact degree of structure you're looking for, but they can still be a lightweight solution for organizing your content and generating prompts.

### 5. **Obsidian with Plugins**
   - **Features**: Since you already use **Obsidian**, building on it could be a less disruptive way to add more functionality:
     - **Dataview Plugin**: You can use the **Dataview plugin** to create powerful, queryable views of your notes, effectively acting like a database.
     - **Obsidian Mobile**: The mobile version already allows you to access and organize your notes in a way that's highly optimized for smaller screens.
     - **Custom AI Integration**: Use the **Templater** plugin to add AI-powered content with API integration. Although not a direct web-based solution, it could offer significant **automation** for prompt generation.

### 6. **Make.com (formerly Integromat)**
   - **Features**: **Make.com** is a powerful automation tool that can link various applications together. You could:
     - **Integrate multiple apps** like **Notion, Airtable, or Google Sheets** with **ChatGPT**, enabling you to push content from ChatGPT into these storage platforms automatically.
   - **UI Flexibility**: Make.com doesn’t directly create a UI for you, but it can make data flow between apps **seamlessly**, allowing you to use existing UIs (like Notion or Airtable) in a more powerful way.

### 7. **Retool**
   - **Features**: **Retool** is a low-code tool specifically for building internal tools. You could use it to create a custom **interface** to interact with your database (e.g., Airtable or PostgreSQL).
   - **Build a Custom Dashboard**: You could create a **front-end UI** that integrates a **ChatGPT-like window** and a **searchable library of context snippets, prompts, and outputs**.
   - **Integrations**: Retool has built-in connectors for popular databases and APIs, meaning you could relatively easily integrate your AI workflow and save outputs.

### 8. **Bubble.io (No-Code Web App Builder)**
   - **Features**: **Bubble.io** allows you to create **web apps** with databases without needing to write code. You could:
     - Build a front-end chat interface that integrates with the **ChatGPT API**.
     - Set up a backend using Bubble’s built-in database features to store context, prompts, and outputs.
   - **Mobile Experience**: Bubble allows for the creation of **responsive web apps**, which can be used seamlessly on both desktops and mobile devices.

### Summary
- **For a Complete Web-Based Workflow**: **Notion** or **Airtable** combined with **Make.com** for automation could cover most of your needs.
- **For Custom UI**: **Retool** or **Bubble.io** might be ideal if you want something closer to your vision, with more control over the UI and integrated workflow.
- **For Low-Code Automation**: **Make.com** or **Zapier** can connect these tools effectively, helping you create a seamless experience where your ChatGPT outputs and context snippets are automatically saved.

If you're willing to compromise slightly on the exact integration and functionality, leveraging these **existing tools** would save a ton of effort while still giving you something **highly functional**. It might even give you more flexibility to iterate quickly on different workflows and find what really works best for you before committing to a more custom-built solution.
