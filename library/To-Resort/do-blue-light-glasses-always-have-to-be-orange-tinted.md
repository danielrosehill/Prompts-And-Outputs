# Prompt

Do blue light glasses always have to have that orange tint to them or are there ways that they can be manufactured and look "normal"? Also: are there any manufacturers who really stand out in this space?

# Output

Blue light glasses don't always have to have that distinctive **orange tint**. While the most effective blue light-blocking lenses tend to have a yellow or orange hue (as they block a wider range of blue wavelengths), there are "clear" or lightly tinted lenses that filter a smaller portion of blue light but still offer some protection. Here’s a breakdown of the types and what to expect:

### 1. **Orange/Yellow-Tinted Lenses**:
   - **Best for blocking blue light**: These glasses block a higher percentage of blue light, particularly in the wavelength that interferes with melatonin production (around 450-480 nm).
   - **Used more for evening wear**: Because the tint can alter color perception, these are often used by people aiming to reduce blue light exposure in the evening for better sleep. They are less suitable for tasks requiring true color accuracy (e.g., design work).

### 2. **Clear or Lightly Tinted Lenses**:
   - **Blocks less blue light**: These lenses typically block 10-30% of blue light, which may still be helpful for digital eye strain during the day but isn't as effective for regulating sleep cycles.
   - **Looks more "normal"**: Clear or lightly tinted blue light glasses appear like regular eyewear and don’t significantly distort color, making them more suitable for daily wear in professional or social settings.

### Key Technologies Behind Clear Lenses:
- **Anti-reflective coatings**: Some clear blue light glasses use special coatings that reflect or absorb blue light, minimizing the amount reaching your eyes without a strong tint.
- **Blue light filter in the lens material itself**: Some manufacturers embed the blue light filter into the lens, so you get a more discreet look without the noticeable tint.

### Manufacturers Who Stand Out:

1. **Felix Gray**:
   - Known for its **clear blue light glasses** that block about 15-30% of blue light. They offer stylish frames that look like regular glasses, making them a popular choice for professional use.
   - Their lenses also have anti-glare coatings to help reduce eye strain, and they focus on comfort for long screen use.

2. **Gunnar Optiks**:
   - Gunnar offers both **yellow-tinted** and **clear** blue light blocking glasses. Their yellow-tinted lenses block a higher percentage of blue light (up to 65%), while their clear lenses are designed to reduce eye strain without significant color distortion.
   - They're well-known in the gaming community and are also used by office professionals who spend long hours in front of screens.

3. **Warby Parker**:
   - Warby Parker offers an affordable range of **blue light filtering lenses** as an add-on to any of their regular prescription or non-prescription glasses. These are generally **clear lenses**, making them great for day-to-day use with minimal visual impact.
   - They’re widely recognized for their stylish frames and customer service, including home try-ons.

4. **Zenni Optical**:
   - Zenni offers affordable **blue light blocking lenses**, including their **Blokz** line, which features both **clear lenses** for daytime use and **amber-tinted lenses** for stronger blue light blocking.
   - They are budget-friendly but still offer a variety of frame styles and the option to add blue light filtering to most of their glasses.

5. **JINS**:
   - JINS offers **JINS SCREEN**, which provides both **clear** and **yellow-tinted** blue light glasses. Their clear lenses filter around 25% of blue light and are designed for daily wear.
   - JINS focuses on fashionable frames, making them a good option for people who want a subtle, stylish look.

### Summary:
- **Tinted lenses** block more blue light but alter color perception.
- **Clear lenses** are great for daily use and block some blue light without changing how colors appear.
  
Brands like **Felix Gray**, **Gunnar**, and **Warby Parker** stand out for combining style and function. If you're sensitive to blue light or spend a lot of time in front of screens, finding the balance between appearance and effectiveness is key, and there are many "normal-looking" options that offer solid protection without the orange tint.
