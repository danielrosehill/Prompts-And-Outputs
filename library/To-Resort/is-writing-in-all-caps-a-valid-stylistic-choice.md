Summary of your prompt: You are asking if writing exclusively in all caps is a valid stylistic choice and if any technical issues or adverse consequences could arise from doing so, aside from potential ridicule from recipients.

Writing exclusively in all caps is a stylistic decision, though it's generally not recommended for the following reasons:

1. **Readability and Legibility**: All-caps text is harder to read than regular mixed-case writing. Our brains process lowercase letters more efficiently because they're more familiar and varied in shape, allowing for easier recognition and flow.

2. **Perception of Tone**: All-caps is commonly perceived as shouting, making your communication seem aggressive or overly emphatic, even when that’s not your intention.

3. **Accessibility**: Screen readers used by visually impaired users may read all-caps differently. Some screen readers interpret all-caps text as abbreviations, while others might struggle to properly handle it, negatively affecting accessibility.

4. **Searchability and Compatibility**: Certain software, particularly older or specialized systems, may handle all-caps text poorly in terms of formatting or search functionality. For example, case sensitivity in search functions could limit finding content when queries aren't in all caps.

5. **Professional Context**: In formal or professional settings, using all caps can come across as unprofessional or jarring, particularly in emails, reports, or other written documents.

Other than these technical and social factors, there aren’t any major technical issues, but the negative perception and difficulty in reading may lead to misunderstandings or alienate your audience. Would you still like to explore this stylistic choice further?
