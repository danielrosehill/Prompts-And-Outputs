**Summary:** You are experiencing difficulty with the visibility of non-highlighted tab headers in some VS Code themes. You like the main text presentation but find it hard to distinguish between active and inactive tabs.

### Suggestions to Improve Tab Header Visibility in VS Code Themes

1. **Adjust the Theme’s Tab Colors Manually**
   - If you like the overall theme but find the tab headers hard to see, you can manually customize the colors in VS Code's settings:
     1. Open **Settings** (`Ctrl+,`).
     2. Search for **"workbench color customizations"**.
     3. Click on **"Edit in settings.json"** under `workbench.colorCustomizations`.
     4. Add the following properties to modify inactive and active tab colors:
        ```json
        "workbench.colorCustomizations": {
            "tab.activeBackground": "#2b2b2b",     // Change this to your preferred active tab color
            "tab.inactiveBackground": "#1e1e1e",  // Change this to your preferred inactive tab color
            "tab.activeForeground": "#ffffff",    // Change this to make active tabs' text more visible
            "tab.inactiveForeground": "#888888"   // Change this to make inactive tabs' text clearer
        }
        ```
   - **Tip**: Play around with the hex codes to find combinations that improve contrast and visibility.

2. **Use "Custom CSS and JS Loader" Extension**
   - If you need more granular control over how tabs and other elements appear, you can use the **"Custom CSS and JS Loader"** extension.
     1. Install the extension from the VS Code marketplace.
     2. Create a CSS file to override the theme’s default tab styles:
        ```css
        .monaco-workbench .tabs-container .tab {
            background-color: #2b2b2b !important;  /* Customize background */
            color: #ffffff !important;            /* Customize text color */
            opacity: 0.7;                         /* Change transparency */
        }
        .monaco-workbench .tabs-container .tab.active {
            opacity: 1;  /* Set active tab to full opacity */
        }
        ```
     3. Load the CSS file through the extension settings to see your changes.

3. **Try Themes That Emphasize Tab Visibility**
   - **"One Dark Pro"**: This popular theme has well-defined, colored tab headers that make it easy to distinguish between active and inactive tabs.
   - **"Material Theme Palenight"**: Offers a soft, yet clear distinction between the tab headers by using subtle color differences and clear text contrast.
   - **"Dracula Official"**: Maintains a distinct and visible tab header system, with brighter backgrounds or bold fonts for active tabs, making them stand out more.
   - **"Night Owl"**: Specifically designed to improve focus and reduce strain, this theme has contrasting colors that make inactive tabs less distracting while keeping the active tab clear.

4. **Use "TabNine" or "Vibrancy" Extensions**
   - Consider using extensions that **adjust or enhance VS Code's UI**. Some of these will allow more flexibility in setting vibrancy and transparency levels, which can make tab headers more visible by tweaking their colors or contrast.

5. **Switch to a High Contrast Theme**
   - If adjusting individual colors doesn’t help, try a **high contrast** theme designed to improve visibility across all UI elements. These themes make the active and inactive tabs more distinguishable by default:
     - **"High Contrast"** (default theme option in VS Code)
     - **"High Contrast Black and White"**: A third-party theme that provides stark differences between elements.

### Summary
For improved visibility of inactive tab headers, you can customize the theme using **`workbench.colorCustomizations`**, try a **new theme with better contrast**, or use **extensions** for more granular control. Experimenting with these methods should help you find a setup that balances the visual elements you like while enhancing clarity.
