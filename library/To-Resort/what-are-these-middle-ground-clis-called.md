# Prompt
Is there a name for these tools that are sort of more advanced than your typical CLI but not quite full fledged GUIs?
# Output

Yes, there is a specific term for these types of interfaces that fall between traditional command-line interfaces (CLIs) and full graphical user interfaces (GUIs). They are called Text-based User Interfaces (TUIs) or sometimes Terminal User Interfaces.

Key characteristics of TUIs include:

1. They run within a terminal or console environment.
2. They offer more visual and interactive elements than a typical CLI.
3. They often support mouse input in addition to keyboard commands.
4. They can use the full screen area of the terminal.
5. They may use text-based graphics, including box-drawing characters and color.

Some notable points about TUIs:

1. They provide a middle ground between the simplicity of CLIs and the user-friendliness of GUIs[4].

2. TUIs are often more lightweight and faster than full GUIs, making them popular for system administration tasks and on servers[3].

3. They can be particularly useful in remote or SSH sessions where a full GUI might be impractical[4].

4. Many TUI applications offer advanced features like window-like panels, menus, and even mouse support within the terminal environment[1].

5. There are several libraries and frameworks designed specifically for creating TUIs, such as ncurses, blessed, and textual[2].

TUIs can be an excellent choice when you need more interactivity than a CLI offers, but don't require (or can't support) a full GUI. They're particularly popular in the Linux and Unix world, but can be found across various operating systems.
