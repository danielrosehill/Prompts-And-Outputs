The trait of intensity in gifted individuals refers to their heightened levels of emotional, intellectual, and physical engagement with the world. They often experience emotions more deeply and are more sensitive to stimuli. This intensity can manifest as a strong passion for learning, an insatiable curiosity, and a deep commitment to interests or causes. Gifted individuals may also demonstrate intense focus and energy when pursuing their goals or interests. This trait can be both a source of joy and a challenge, as it may lead to heightened stress or frustration in certain situations.
