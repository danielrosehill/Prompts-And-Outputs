# Output

Based on the information provided, I can address your questions about running Ollama on Fedora Linux and the hardware recommendations for running LLMs like Code Llama.

Running Ollama on Fedora Linux:

Yes, it is possible to run Ollama on Fedora Linux. There are a few methods to install and run Ollama:

1. Using the official installation script:
   ```
   curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
   ```
   This method has been tested and works on Fedora[4].

2. Using Snap:
   ```
   sudo dnf install snapd
   sudo ln -s /var/lib/snapd/snap /snap
   sudo snap install ollama
   ```
   This method uses the Snap package manager, which needs to be installed first[6].

3. Manual installation:
   You can download and extract the package manually, following the instructions in the Ollama GitHub repository[5].

Hardware Recommendations:

The hardware requirements for running LLMs like Code Llama can be quite demanding, especially for larger models. Here are some general recommendations:

1. CPU: A high-end multi-core processor. AMD Ryzen Threadripper, Intel Xeon, or high-end consumer CPUs like Intel Core i9 or AMD Ryzen 9[2].

2. GPU: This is the most crucial component. NVIDIA GPUs are generally preferred due to better support for AI frameworks.
   - For smaller models: NVIDIA RTX 3090 or 4090 (24GB VRAM)
   - For larger models: NVIDIA A100 or professional-grade GPUs like RTX 5000 or 6000 series[2][3].

3. RAM: Minimum of 32GB, preferably 64GB or more[1][2].

4. Storage: Fast SSD storage, with at least 20-30GB free for the model and associated data[1].

For Code Llama specifically:
- The 8B parameter version requires at least an NVIDIA RTX 3090 or 4090 with 24GB VRAM.
- The 70B parameter version has much higher requirements and may need multiple high-end GPUs or specialized hardware[1].

If you're unsure about your hardware specifications, you can start with smaller models like the 8B or 13B versions of Code Llama, which have lower hardware requirements. Ollama allows you to choose different model sizes based on your hardware capabilities[4].

Remember, while consumer-grade hardware can handle inference tasks and light fine-tuning, large-scale training and fine-tuning of big models demand more powerful, enterprise-grade hardware[2].
