# Prompt

are there any news aggregation sites that let you add an unlimited number of web pages to read as feeds? I found a few that looked promising but they have very low limits on non-RSS feeds

### Custom Solutions:
If you require more flexibility, you can also consider creating your own custom solution using tools like **Python** scripts, web scraping libraries (e.g., BeautifulSoup), or automation platforms like **Zapier** to pull content from websites and organize it into a custom RSS or notification feed.

These tools should provide more flexibility than platforms with strict limits on non-RSS feeds. If you need to monitor a large number of web pages, exploring paid versions or custom setups could offer a better solution.
