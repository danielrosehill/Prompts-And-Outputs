# Prompt

in vs code is there any way to maintain a library of python scripts for data cleaning work that I can use when needed in other projects? this way I wouldn't have to recreate similar scripts in every repo

# Output
Yes, in **VS Code** (or any development environment), you can maintain a **library of reusable Python scripts** for data cleaning (or any other task) that you can easily **import and use** in multiple projects without recreating them every time. There are several ways you can approach this, depending on your preferred workflow. Below are a few strategies:

### **1. Create a Python Package for Data Cleaning**

If you frequently reuse certain scripts or functions for data cleaning across projects, it makes sense to organize them into a **Python package** that you can import in any project.

#### **Steps to Create a Reusable Python Package**:
1. **Organize your scripts** into a separate folder (e.g., `data_cleaning_lib/`).
2. Inside that folder, create a `setup.py` file to define it as an installable package.
3. You can **install** this package locally in any project, so you can reuse the functions.

#### **Example Structure**:
```bash
data_cleaning_lib/
├── __init__.py         # Makes it a Python package
├── clean_duplicates.py # Script to handle duplicates
├── normalize_values.py  # Script to normalize data
├── missing_values.py    # Script to handle missing values
└── setup.py            # Package configuration
```

#### **Example `setup.py`**:
```python
from setuptools import setup, find_packages

setup(
    name='data_cleaning_lib',
    version='1.0',
    packages=find_packages(),
    description='A library for common data cleaning tasks',
    author='Your Name',
    author_email='youremail@example.com'
)
```

#### **Using the Package in Your Projects**:
1. **Install the package** locally by running this command from within the `data_cleaning_lib` directory:
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

2. Once installed, you can **import** any function from your package into any Python script in another project like this:

```python
from data_cleaning_lib.clean_duplicates import remove_duplicates
from data_cleaning_lib.normalize_values import normalize_column

# Use the imported functions
cleaned_data = remove_duplicates(df)
normalized_data = normalize_column(df['column'])
```

#### **Advantages**:
- Easy to maintain and update a **single source** of your data cleaning logic.
- Can be reused across **multiple projects** with a simple import.
- No need to copy-paste code between repositories.

---

### **2. Create a Shared Folder and Use Imports**

If you don't want to go through the process of creating a full package, you can simply maintain a **shared folder** of Python scripts that you can access from multiple projects. You can then **import** scripts from that folder.

#### **Steps**:
1. **Create a directory** where you store your reusable data cleaning scripts (e.g., `~/python-libs/data_cleaning/`).

2. **Add the folder to your Python path** in any project where you want to use the scripts.

   You can add it by modifying the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable or directly in your script using `sys.path`.

#### **Example**:
```python
import sys
sys.path.append('/path/to/your/python-libs/data_cleaning')

from clean_duplicates import remove_duplicates
from normalize_values import normalize_column
```

#### **Advantages**:
- Easier and quicker to set up than a full package.
- No installation required—just modify the Python path.
- Great for personal or small-scale projects where version control is less critical.

#### **Disadvantages**:
- You need to manually ensure that the folder is available and correctly added to the path for each project.

### **3. Use Git Submodules or Symbolic Links**

Another way to maintain reusable scripts is to keep your library of data cleaning scripts in a **Git repository** and either **submodule** it into other projects or use **symbolic links**.

#### **Option 1: Git Submodules**:
You can include your data cleaning repository as a **submodule** in any project. This way, it stays linked to its original repository and can be updated easily across multiple projects.

1. **Create a separate Git repo** for your data cleaning scripts (e.g., `data-cleaning-lib`).
2. In each new project, add the library as a submodule:
   ```bash
   git submodule add https://github.com/yourusername/data-cleaning-lib.git
   ```
3. In your project, you can import the library:
   ```python
   from data_cleaning_lib.clean_duplicates import remove_duplicates
   ```

#### **Option 2: Symbolic Links**:
You can create a **symbolic link** to the folder where your shared scripts are stored.

1. Keep your data cleaning library in a central location (e.g., `~/python-libs/data_cleaning/`).
2. In each project where you want to use the library, create a symbolic link to the folder:
   ```bash
   ln -s /path/to/python-libs/data_cleaning /path/to/your/project/data_cleaning
   ```
3. Import the scripts as if they were part of the project:
   ```python
   from data_cleaning.clean_duplicates import remove_duplicates
   ```

#### **Advantages**:
- **Submodules**: Keep your shared scripts under version control with updates easily pulled into multiple projects.
- **Symbolic links**: A simple, lightweight way to maintain a common library without copying files.

### **4. Using Jupyter Notebooks (for Notebooks-Based Workflows)**

If your data cleaning work is primarily **notebook-based**, you can store your reusable functions in **Jupyter Notebooks** and import them into other notebooks as **modules**.

#### **Steps**:
1. Store your data cleaning functions in a central notebook, e.g., `data_cleaning_lib.ipynb`.
2. Use a tool like `importnb` to **import the functions** from the notebook into another notebook.

#### **Example Using `importnb`**:
```bash
pip install importnb
```

Then, in your notebook:
```python
from importnb import Notebook
with Notebook():
    from data_cleaning_lib import remove_duplicates, normalize_column
```

### **Conclusion**:
- **Python Package**: Best if you want a robust, maintainable solution for multiple projects, especially if you want versioning and easy installation.
- **Shared Folder + Imports**: Quick and easy setup for personal projects without much overhead.
- **Git Submodules/Symbolic Links**: Useful for version control, sharing across teams, or keeping a central repository.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Great if you're working primarily with notebooks and want to reuse code there.
