# Prompt

Is it possible to "undo" moving your system over to RAID1? If I wanted to go back to using regular BTRFS without RAID is there any mechanism for editing the system in that way?

# Output

Yes, it is possible to undo a move from **RAID1** back to a **single-disk (non-RAID)** BTRFS configuration, but it requires careful steps to **rebalance** the data on the filesystem. BTRFS has built-in tools to manage multi-device RAID configurations, so you can convert between RAID levels or even remove RAID configurations entirely.

Here’s a guide on how to undo RAID1 in BTRFS and revert to a single-disk configuration:

### **Understanding BTRFS RAID1 Setup**
- In **BTRFS RAID1**, data is mirrored across two or more devices for redundancy.
- To undo RAID1, you'll need to remove the additional device(s) and **rebalance** the data to a single drive.

### **Step-by-Step Guide to Revert from RAID1 to Single-Disk BTRFS**

#### **1. Check Your Current Setup**
Before making any changes, check the current status of your BTRFS system to confirm it's in RAID1 mode:
```bash
sudo btrfs filesystem df /
```
This command will display the RAID configuration for data, metadata, and system profiles. If you see `RAID1` for data or metadata, it confirms the RAID1 setup.

#### **2. Remove the Second Device from the BTRFS Volume**
To move away from RAID1, the next step is to **remove** the additional disk(s) used in the RAID configuration. First, identify which devices are in the BTRFS RAID1 setup:
```bash
sudo btrfs filesystem show /
```
This command will show the devices in your BTRFS setup.

Next, remove the additional device from the BTRFS filesystem:
```bash
sudo btrfs device remove /dev/sdX /
```
Replace `/dev/sdX` with the name of the device you want to remove.

#### **3. Rebalance the Filesystem**
After removing the device, you’ll need to **rebalance** the data so that BTRFS no longer mirrors across two devices. The rebalance operation will reallocate the data, converting it back to a **single-device configuration**.

To rebalance the filesystem:
```bash
sudo btrfs balance start -mconvert=single -dconvert=single /
```
- `-mconvert=single` converts the **metadata** from RAID1 to a single-disk setup.
- `-dconvert=single` converts the **data** from RAID1 to a single-disk setup.

This command ensures that both data and metadata are stored on a single device, effectively removing the RAID1 setup.

You can monitor the rebalance process with:
```bash
sudo btrfs balance status /
```

#### **4. Confirm the Rebalance**
Once the rebalance process is complete, verify that the filesystem is no longer using RAID1:
```bash
sudo btrfs filesystem df /
```
You should now see `single` under the data and metadata profiles, confirming that the RAID1 configuration has been removed.

#### **5. Optionally, Resize the Filesystem (if necessary)**
If you originally set up the RAID1 across two devices and want to resize the filesystem to reflect the new single-disk setup, you can use the following command:
```bash
sudo btrfs filesystem resize max /
```
This will resize the filesystem to use the full capacity of the remaining device.

### **Backup and Safety**
- **Back Up Important Data**: Before making any changes to your RAID or filesystem, it’s critical to back up all important data. Although BTRFS is robust, filesystem changes carry inherent risks.
- **Test in a Non-Critical Environment**: If possible, test the conversion process in a non-critical environment or on a test system before applying changes to production systems.

### **Conclusion**
Yes, it’s possible to undo moving your BTRFS system to RAID1 and revert back to a single-disk setup. By removing the additional device and using BTRFS's rebalance feature, you can convert the data and metadata back to `single` mode. This process effectively restores your system to a standard non-RAID BTRFS configuration.
