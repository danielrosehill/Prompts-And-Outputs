# Prompt

Is it possible to configure a Google shared drive as a remote in rclone or any other CLI that works with Fedora? And to do so in a way that doesn't require syncing the whole drive but more mounts it as a remote volume?

# Output

Yes, it is absolutely possible to configure a **Google Shared Drive** as a remote in **rclone** on Fedora (or any other Linux distribution) without syncing the entire drive, effectively mounting it as a remote volume. This method allows you to browse and work with files directly on the drive without downloading everything locally.

### Steps to Configure a Google Shared Drive as a Remote in rclone:

#### Step 1: Install rclone
If you haven't installed **rclone** yet, you can install it on Fedora using the following command:

```bash
sudo dnf install rclone
```

#### Step 2: Configure rclone for Google Drive
1. **Run the rclone configuration**:

   ```bash
   rclone config
   ```

2. **Add a new remote**:
   - Type `n` to create a new remote.
   - Name the remote (e.g., `mysharedrive`).

3. **Choose the cloud storage**:
   - Select **Drive** by typing the corresponding number (usually `13` for Google Drive).

4. **Configure Google Drive authentication**:
   - When prompted for the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**, leave them blank for the default or input your own if you have a Google API project set up.
   
5. **Scope of Access**:
   - Choose the access scope for rclone. To access both shared and personal drives, choose the following option:
     ```
     1 / Full access all files, including Application Data Folder.
     ```
     (Choose the appropriate number based on your version.)

6. **Shared Drive Support**:
   - When prompted with the question **"Configure this as a team drive?"**, type `y` to indicate that you want to configure the remote for a Shared Drive (Team Drive).

7. **Obtain the authentication token**:
   - Follow the on-screen instructions to log in to your Google account and authorize rclone.

8. **Complete the setup**:
   - If successful, rclone will confirm the connection and offer a few final options. Choose the defaults or fine-tune as needed, then type `q` to quit the configuration.

#### Step 3: Mount the Google Shared Drive
Now that the remote is configured, you can mount it as a remote volume using **rclone mount**. This step ensures that files are accessed directly from the cloud, without syncing the entire drive.

1. **Create a mount point** (if it doesnâ€™t already exist):

   ```bash
   mkdir ~/sharedrive
   ```

2. **Mount the Google Shared Drive**:

   ```bash
   rclone mount mysharedrive: ~/sharedrive --vfs-cache-mode minimal
   ```

   - `mysharedrive` is the name of the remote you configured in rclone.
   - `~/sharedrive` is the local mount point.
   - `--vfs-cache-mode minimal` allows for minimal caching of files locally, so that you can access them as needed without downloading everything.

3. **Access the files**:
   - Now, files will be accessible under the mount point `~/sharedrive` as if they are part of the local file system. You can open, edit, and manage files directly on Google Drive without syncing them locally.

#### Step 4: Unmount the Google Drive
When you're done, unmount the drive using:

```bash
fusermount -u ~/sharedrive
```

### Optional: Automating the Mounting Process
You can create a systemd service to automatically mount the drive at boot or on demand:

1. **Create a systemd service file**:

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/rclone-sharedrive.service
   ```

2. **Add the following content**:

   ```ini
   [Unit]
   Description=Mount Google Shared Drive using rclone
   After=network-online.target

   [Service]
   Type=simple
   ExecStart=/usr/bin/rclone mount mysharedrive: /home/yourusername/sharedrive --vfs-cache-mode minimal
   ExecStop=/bin/fusermount -u /home/yourusername/sharedrive
   Restart=always
   User=yourusername

   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   ```

   - Replace `yourusername` with your actual username.
   - Replace `/home/yourusername/sharedrive` with the correct path for the mount point.

3. **Enable and start the service**:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable rclone-sharedrive.service
   sudo systemctl start rclone-sharedrive.service
   ```

This will automatically mount the shared Google Drive upon boot and keep it running as a background service.

### Conclusion:
Using **rclone**, you can easily mount a Google Shared Drive as a remote volume without syncing the entire drive. This method is highly efficient, especially if you work with large shared drives and want direct access to files from the cloud.
