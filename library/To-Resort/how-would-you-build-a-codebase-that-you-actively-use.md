# Prompt
OK, now here are the technical questions. So let's say that I develop my project for storing LLM outputs. I might wish to follow exactly the use-case I'm currently using which is using a B2 bucket for storage. I want to build something that I can actually use so that I can validate that it works and use it for my own purposes. But naturally I won't want to include any of my own data in the code that I may choose to release publicly ... and I'll certainly want to make sure that I don't include any environment variables. How does one go about building a codebase that you actually use?

# Output

Building a codebase that you actively use while ensuring that sensitive data like API keys, environment variables, and personal data are not exposed when you make the project public involves a few best practices. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to approach this:

### **1. Use Environment Variables**
   - **Purpose**: Environment variables are a standard way to manage sensitive information like API keys, database credentials, and bucket URLs.
   - **Implementation**:
     - Use a `.env` file to store your environment variables locally. This file should never be committed to your version control system.
     - Use a library like `dotenv` (in Node.js, Python, etc.) to load these environment variables into your application at runtime.
   - **Example** (using Python):
     ```python
     from dotenv import load_dotenv
     import os

     load_dotenv()

     B2_BUCKET_NAME = os.getenv('B2_BUCKET_NAME')
     B2_ACCESS_KEY = os.getenv('B2_ACCESS_KEY')
     B2_SECRET_KEY = os.getenv('B2_SECRET_KEY')
     ```

### **2. Use `.gitignore` for Sensitive Files**
   - **Purpose**: Ensure that sensitive files are not tracked by your version control system (e.g., Git).
   - **Implementation**:
     - Create a `.gitignore` file in your project root.
     - Add the `.env` file and any other sensitive files to the `.gitignore` file.
   - **Example**:
     ```
     # .gitignore
     .env
     config/*.yml
     credentials/
     ```

### **3. Separate Configuration from Code**
   - **Purpose**: Keep environment-specific configuration (like your B2 bucket settings) separate from the code itself.
   - **Implementation**:
     - Use configuration files (like `config.yaml`, `config.json`, or `.env`) to store settings that might differ between environments (e.g., development, production).
     - Load these configurations dynamically depending on the environment.
   - **Example**:
     - Create a `config/` directory with files like `config.dev.json`, `config.prod.json`.
     - Dynamically load the appropriate configuration based on the environment.

### **4. Use Secrets Management Services (Optional)**
   - **Purpose**: For production systems, consider using a secrets management service like AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, or Azure Key Vault to securely manage and access sensitive data.
   - **Implementation**:
     - Store secrets in the secrets management service and retrieve them at runtime.
     - This adds an extra layer of security compared to environment variables stored in a file.

### **5. Keep Development and Production Environments Separate**
   - **Purpose**: Avoid using the same credentials or configurations in development and production environments to prevent accidental exposure.
   - **Implementation**:
     - Use different sets of environment variables or configuration files for development and production.
     - Ensure that production configurations are not exposed in your development environment.

### **6. Use Dummy Data in Example Files**
   - **Purpose**: Provide example files (`.env.example`, `config.example.json`) that contain placeholder values instead of real credentials.
   - **Implementation**:
     - Create `.env.example` with placeholder values and include it in your repository to show users what environment variables are needed.
     - Make sure that `.env.example` is committed to version control, but `.env` is not.
   - **Example**:
     ```bash
     # .env.example
     B2_BUCKET_NAME=your-bucket-name-here
     B2_ACCESS_KEY=your-access-key-here
     B2_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
     ```

### **7. Review Code Before Committing**
   - **Purpose**: Ensure that sensitive data is not accidentally committed to your repository.
   - **Implementation**:
     - Always review your code and configuration files before committing.
     - Use tools like `git-secrets` to scan for sensitive data in your codebase before allowing commits.
     - Set up pre-commit hooks to automatically check for sensitive data.

### **8. CI/CD Considerations**
   - **Purpose**: Ensure that your continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines handle sensitive data securely.
   - **Implementation**:
     - Store sensitive variables in the CI/CD system’s environment variables or secrets management section.
     - Avoid hardcoding any sensitive information directly in your CI/CD scripts.

### **9. Document the Process**
   - **Purpose**: Help future contributors (or your future self) understand how to configure the environment.
   - **Implementation**:
     - Provide clear documentation on how to set up the development environment, including which environment variables need to be set and where to get them.
     - Include a section on security practices to follow when contributing to the project.

### **Example Workflow**
1. **Local Development**:
   - Use a `.env` file with your personal credentials and settings.
   - Ensure that `.env` is in your `.gitignore` file.
   - Use placeholders in your code and example configuration files for public reference.

2. **Production Deployment**:
   - Use environment variables set on the server or in your secrets management service.
   - Ensure that sensitive data is never hardcoded or exposed.

3. **Releasing the Code**:
   - Before making the repository public, audit the codebase for any lingering sensitive data.
   - Ensure that all sensitive configurations are handled through environment variables or external configuration files that are not part of the repository.

By following these best practices, you can build, use, and release your markdown-centric LLM notepad app while keeping your sensitive data secure and separate from the public codebase.## Extracted Prompts
