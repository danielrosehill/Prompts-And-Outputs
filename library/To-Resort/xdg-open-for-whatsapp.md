**Summary of the prompt:** You're asking whether it's possible to get `xdg-open` to work with Franz on Fedora Linux to handle a WhatsApp link (`whatsapp://send/?phone=972523277630&text&type=phone_number&app_absent=0`).

Yes, it is possible to configure `xdg-open` to handle WhatsApp links with Franz on Fedora Linux. Here's how you can try to set this up:

### Step 1: Set Franz as the Default Handler for `whatsapp://` URLs
You need to configure the `xdg-open` system to recognize `whatsapp://` URLs and redirect them to Franz.

1. **Create a .desktop file for Franz**  
   If you haven't already set up a `.desktop` file for Franz (used to launch the app), you will need to create one:

   Open a terminal and create a file called `franz.desktop` in the `~/.local/share/applications/` directory:

   ```bash
   nano ~/.local/share/applications/franz.desktop
   ```

   In this file, add the following content:

   ```ini
   [Desktop Entry]
   Name=Franz
   Comment=Franz App
   Exec=/path/to/franz/executable %u
   Icon=franz
   Terminal=false
   Type=Application
  h MimeType=x-scheme-handler/whatsapp;
   ```

   Replace `/path/to/franz/executable` with the actual path to your Franz executable (you can find it by running `which franz` in the terminal).

2. **Register Franz as the handler for WhatsApp URLs**  
   Next, you'll need to associate Franz with the `whatsapp://` URL scheme:

   Run this command to update the system's MIME type database and make Franz the handler for WhatsApp:

   ```bash
   xdg-mime default franz.desktop x-scheme-handler/whatsapp
   ```

### Step 2: Test `xdg-open`
Now, test if the `xdg-open` command works with the WhatsApp link. Open a terminal and run:

```bash
xdg-open "whatsapp://send/?phone=972523277630&text&type=phone_number&app_absent=0"
```

Franz should now open and handle the link by redirecting it to WhatsApp within the Franz app.

### Step 3: Debugging (if it doesn’t work)
- **Check the Franz installation**: Ensure that Franz is correctly installed and that the path in your `.desktop` file is accurate.
- **Reboot or Reload**: Sometimes, you might need to reboot or log out and log back in for the MIME type handler change to take effect.
- **Check Franz’s URL Handling**: Make sure that Franz itself is configured to handle WhatsApp links correctly.

This should allow `xdg-open` to pass the `whatsapp://` links to Franz. If you encounter issues or if Franz doesn't handle the links as expected, feel free to reach out for additional troubleshooting!
