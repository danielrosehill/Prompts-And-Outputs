# Prompt

I have an idea for an app that I'd like to test out. The functionality would be like this. The app uses the OpenAI API (it would ask the user for their key). It only does one thing: come up with an infinite number of suggestions for how ChatGPT could be used. In other words, it suggests use-cases at random. But the use-case suggestions should not repeat. They should be reasonably unique. The interface is a bit like the dating app Tinder. The user can simply indicate that they like the idea or not with a thumbs up thumbs down. The ideas that they like are recorded and saved into a running markdown document on a storage of their choice. Google Drive makes the most sense to me. Could this be built? What do you think of the idea? I think a web UI makes the most sense so that it could be used from a variety of devices.

# Output

Your idea sounds fantastic! Here's a breakdown of the core functionalities and technical implementation:

### **App Functionality:**
1. **OpenAI API Integration**:
   - The app will use the OpenAI API to generate unique and random use-case suggestions for ChatGPT. The app will ask the user to enter their API key when first setting it up.
   - The suggestions need to be unique, meaning that the app should store previous suggestions to avoid repetition.
   
2. **Tinder-like UI**:
   - Each suggestion is presented one at a time, with the user given the option to give it a thumbs-up (save it) or thumbs-down (discard it).
   - A card-swiping interface could be used, similar to Tinder, where swiping or tapping thumbs up/down actions the decision.

3. **Save Liked Ideas**:
   - When the user gives a thumbs-up, the idea is recorded and saved into a markdown document.
   - The user can choose a storage solution—like Google Drive, OneDrive, or local storage—where the markdown document will be saved and continuously appended with new liked ideas.

4. **Web UI**:
   - A web interface makes the app device-agnostic, allowing users to access it from their computers, tablets, or phones.
   - **Google Drive integration** will allow the app to directly append to a markdown document saved on the user’s drive. You can implement OAuth2 to securely connect users' Google accounts to the app.

### **Technical Approach:**

1. **Front-End Development**:
   - **Framework**: The web interface can be built with a framework like **React** or **Vue.js** for a responsive and fluid UI, where users can swipe or click thumbs-up/thumbs-down buttons for each idea.
   - **State Management**: Use a system like **Redux** or **Vuex** to manage the history of suggestions and prevent duplicates.

2. **Back-End Development**:
   - **Node.js with Express**: This can handle interactions between the front end, OpenAI’s API, and the file storage solution (Google Drive, etc.). It can handle API requests, store the list of previous suggestions, and manage OAuth2 authentication for Drive.
   - **OpenAI API Requests**: Generate random, unique suggestions using an OpenAI completion model. Include prompts like "Suggest a creative use case for ChatGPT in [specific domain]" and randomize the inputs (e.g., business, education, entertainment).
   
3. **Avoiding Duplicate Suggestions**:
   - Store previously suggested use cases in a **database** or in-memory solution like **Redis** during the session. You can create a hash of each suggestion to quickly identify duplicates before showing them to the user.

4. **Google Drive Integration**:
   - Use **Google Drive API** for users to save their liked suggestions as markdown. OAuth2 will allow users to sign in securely.
   - Alternatively, if users don’t want Google Drive, you could offer **local storage** or other cloud storage options (e.g., Dropbox, OneDrive).

5. **Markdown Generation**:
   - Each time the user gives a thumbs-up, the liked idea is appended to the markdown file with the appropriate formatting (`# Suggestion Title`, followed by the idea).

### **Development Tools:**
- **Front-end**: React.js, Vue.js, or similar for the Tinder-like UI (swiping, thumbs-up/thumbs-down).
- **Back-end**: Node.js (Express), or you could even go serverless with platforms like **AWS Lambda** or **Firebase Functions**.
- **Google API**: For Drive integration, you’ll use Google’s OAuth2 authentication and the Drive API for file handling.
- **Database**: Simple databases like **SQLite**, **Firebase**, or a NoSQL option like **MongoDB** for storing previously generated use cases.

### **Workflow Example:**

1. **User Opens App**: 
   - They are prompted to enter their OpenAI API key (if not done already).
   - They are asked to log into Google Drive to set up storage.
   
2. **Generating Use Cases**: 
   - The app pulls unique use-case suggestions from ChatGPT using randomized prompts.
   - Display one use case at a time, allowing users to swipe left/right or click thumbs-up/down.
   
3. **Saving Liked Suggestions**:
   - When the user likes a suggestion, it's saved into their Google Drive in a markdown file.
   
4. **Avoiding Repetition**:
   - Ensure suggestions don’t repeat within the session or across saved ideas by keeping track of shown and liked use cases.

### **Next Steps**:
- **Prototype the UI**: Design a minimal UI to simulate the swiping/thumbs-up experience.
- **Build the OpenAI interaction**: Write the backend to pull random suggestions from the API.
- **Integrate with Google Drive**: Set up OAuth2 and connect to users' Drive to save suggestions.
