Yes, **retweets** do have a **unique URL** on Twitter. When you retweet something, Twitter treats it as a new post on your timeline, and it is given its own unique URL, just like an original tweet. This URL will link to the **retweet**, showing the original tweet embedded in the retweet with a label indicating it was retweeted by you.

### How to Access the Unique URL of a Retweet:
1. **Go to your profile** and find the retweet you want to link.
2. **Click on the timestamp** of the retweet (it may say something like "1h" for one hour ago).
3. This will open the retweet in a new window or tab, and the URL in the address bar will be the **unique URL** of the retweet.

You can copy this URL to reference or share it, and it will show both your retweet and the original tweet embedded within.
