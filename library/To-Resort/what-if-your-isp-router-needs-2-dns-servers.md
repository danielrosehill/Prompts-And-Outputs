No, it's not necessary to set the **Pi-hole local IP address twice** in your ISP router's DNS settings. Instead, you should set the **Pi-hole** as the **primary DNS server** and then use a **reliable public DNS server** as the **secondary DNS server** for redundancy. Here’s why and how you should configure it:

### **Why Not Set Pi-hole Twice as Both DNS Servers?**
- Setting the **same IP twice** (i.e., the Pi-hole's IP address) doesn't add any real benefit, as it’s effectively telling your router to use the same server for both primary and secondary DNS requests. 
- If your **Pi-hole** were to go down or become unavailable (e.g., due to a power failure, network issue, or Pi-hole maintenance), your network would have **no fallback**, and DNS resolution would stop working for all connected devices.

### **Recommended Setup**
- **Primary DNS**: Set this to the **local IP address of your Pi-hole** (e.g., **`192.168.1.30`**).
- **Secondary DNS**: Set this to a **public DNS server** of your choice for redundancy, such as:
  - **Google DNS**: **`8.8.8.8`**
  - **Cloudflare DNS**: **`1.1.1.1`**
  - **Quad9 DNS**: **`9.9.9.9`**

This way, if Pi-hole is unavailable, your devices will still be able to resolve domain names through the **secondary DNS server**.

### **How to Configure This on Your Router**
1. **Access the Router’s Admin Interface**:
   - Typically available at **`http://192.168.1.1`** or **`192.168.1.1`**.
   
2. **Find the DNS Settings**:
   - Go to the **Network Settings**, **LAN Setup**, or **DHCP Settings** section.
   
3. **Enter DNS Server Addresses**:
   - **Primary DNS**: Enter the IP address of your **Pi-hole** (e.g., **`192.168.1.30`**).
   - **Secondary DNS**: Enter a public DNS server (e.g., **`1.1.1.1`** for **Cloudflare**).

4. **Save Settings**:
   - Save and apply the changes, and **reboot** your router if required.

### **Benefits of Using a Secondary DNS Server**
1. **Redundancy**: If your **Pi-hole** goes offline for any reason, the router will use the secondary DNS, which ensures your network remains functional.
2. **No Service Interruptions**: Devices will continue to access the internet without noticeable interruption, even during **Pi-hole maintenance** or when **Pi-hole** is down.
3. **Balanced Load** (to an extent): Though Pi-hole handles ad filtering and blocking, the secondary DNS server acts as a safety net and can help share some of the load if there are occasional connectivity issues.

### **Considerations**
- When you set a **public DNS server** as the **secondary**:
  - **Some Ads Might Slip Through**: If your **Pi-hole** becomes unavailable, DNS queries will go through the **secondary DNS server**, bypassing Pi-hole’s filtering.
  - It’s best to **monitor Pi-hole** to ensure it stays available most of the time. If it’s stable, your network will benefit from ad and tracking blocking while still having redundancy.

### **Summary**
- Set **Pi-hole’s IP** (`192.168.1.30`) as the **primary DNS**.
- Set a **public DNS server** (like **Google** at `8.8.8.8`, or **Cloudflare** at `1.1.1.1`) as the **secondary DNS** for redundancy.
- This way, if Pi-hole is temporarily offline, your network can still perform DNS lookups through the secondary DNS, keeping your devices connected to the internet.

This is a **best-practice approach** to ensure you have the benefits of **ad-blocking with Pi-hole** while also maintaining **network stability** in case of Pi-hole downtime.
