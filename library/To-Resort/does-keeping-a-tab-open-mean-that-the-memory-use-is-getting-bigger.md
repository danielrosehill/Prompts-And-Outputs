# Prompt

If I keep a conversation in ChatGPT open, does that mean that the tab is using progressively more memory as I keep going? Should I be starting new chats every time I switch to a new subject?

# Output

No, keeping a conversation open in ChatGPT does not mean that the tab is progressively using more memory on your local system. The conversation itself is stored and processed server-side, not in your browser’s memory, so the memory usage on your device should not increase significantly as the conversation grows.

That said, there are a couple of reasons you might want to start a new conversation:
1. **Context Management**: As you switch topics, starting a new conversation gives the model a clean slate, which can help it focus better on the new subject without the context from earlier topics potentially affecting the conversation.
   
2. **Session Clarity**: Starting new chats for different topics can help you keep each discussion organized, especially if you're switching between unrelated subjects. This is more about managing your workflow and keeping things tidy.

In terms of memory or performance, though, keeping an ongoing chat open shouldn’t negatively impact your device’s resources. If you're comfortable with how the conversation is progressing, there's no need to start a new one unless you want to reset the context or organize topics better.
