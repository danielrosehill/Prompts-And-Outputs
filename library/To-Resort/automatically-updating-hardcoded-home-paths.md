# Prompt

Let's say that I've stupidly hardcoded my home path (/home/daniel) into some of my dot files like my Bash config. Is there any way to do a quick bath rewrite ... to change every /home/daniel to ~/ ?

# Output

Yes, you can quickly rewrite all instances of `/home/daniel` to `~/` in your dotfiles using the `sed` command, which is perfect for batch editing files from the command line.

Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

### Batch Rewrite with `sed`:

```bash
sed -i 's|/home/daniel|~|g' ~/.bashrc ~/.bash_profile ~/.config/other_dotfile
```

### Explanation:
- `sed`: The stream editor used for making substitutions.
- `-i`: Edits the files in place, meaning the changes will be directly applied to the files.
- `'s|/home/daniel|~|g'`: The `s|old|new|g` is the substitution pattern, where `old` is `/home/daniel` and `new` is `~`. The `g` at the end means "global" so that all occurrences in each file will be replaced, not just the first occurrence on each line.
- `~/.bashrc ~/.bash_profile ~/.config/other_dotfile`: These are the files to be edited. You can include as many files as needed.

### Apply to All Dotfiles:

If you want to apply this substitution to all dotfiles in your home directory, you can do this with a loop or find command. For example, to replace in all `.bash*` files:

```bash
find ~ -maxdepth 1 -name ".bash*" -exec sed -i 's|/home/daniel|~|g' {} +
```

This will find all files in your home directory that start with `.bash` (like `.bashrc`, `.bash_profile`, etc.) and apply the `sed` substitution.

### Caution:
Before running the command, I suggest backing up your dotfiles in case something unexpected happens:

```bash
cp ~/.bashrc ~/.bashrc.bak
cp ~/.bash_profile ~/.bash_profile.bak
```

### Revert `/home/daniel` to `$HOME` Instead:

Alternatively, you might want to use `$HOME` instead of `~`, especially in scripts:

```bash
sed -i 's|/home/daniel|$HOME|g' ~/.bashrc ~/.bash_profile ~/.config/other_dotfile
```

Let me know how this works for you, or if you need any other adjustments!
