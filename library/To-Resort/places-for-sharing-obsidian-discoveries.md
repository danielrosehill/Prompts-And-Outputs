*Note: this repository consists of the outputs of large language models (LLMs). In many cases, these are unedited or minimally edited. The information provided is for demonstrative purposes only and is intended to highlight constraints and capabilities in LLM applications and prompt engineering strategies.*


# Prompt

Can you think of some ways in which I could share details of the ways I'm using Obsidian for experimenting with LLMs and optimising output capture? Are there communities and blogs?

# Output

Based on your query and the context provided, there are several ways you can share your experiences and experiments with using Obsidian for LLM interactions and output capture optimization. Here are some suggestions:

## Online Communities

1. **Obsidian Forum**: The official Obsidian forum is an excellent place to share your experiences and connect with other Obsidian users interested in LLM integration. You can create a thread in the "Share & showcase" category to discuss your setup and workflows[3].

2. **Reddit**: The r/ObsidianMD subreddit has active discussions about AI and LLM integration with Obsidian. You can create a post detailing your experiments and ask for feedback from the community[4].

3. **GitHub**: If you've developed any custom scripts or plugins, consider sharing them on GitHub. The Obsidian community is quite active there, and you might find collaborators or users interested in your work[2].

## Blogging and Content Creation

1. **Medium**: Write detailed articles about your Obsidian-LLM setup, workflows, and experiments. Medium has a good readership for tech-related content and allows for rich formatting and code snippets[5].

2. **Personal Blog**: Create a dedicated blog using platforms like Ghost, WordPress, or static site generators like Hugo or Jekyll. This gives you full control over your content and allows you to build a personal brand around your Obsidian-LLM experiments.

3. **YouTube Tutorials**: Create video tutorials demonstrating your setup, workflows, and tips for integrating LLMs with Obsidian. Visual content can be very helpful for explaining complex setups.

## Sharing Specifics

When sharing your experiences, consider focusing on these aspects:

1. **Custom Workflows**: Describe how you've set up your Obsidian vault to work with LLMs, including folder structures, naming conventions, and linking strategies.

2. **API Integration**: If you've implemented direct API calls to LLMs, share your approach and any code snippets or plugins you've developed[1].

3. **Output Management**: Explain your system for capturing, organizing, and linking LLM outputs within Obsidian.

4. **Prompt Libraries**: Showcase how you manage and organize your prompts, and how you link them to outputs and contextual information.

5. **Performance Metrics**: If you're tracking the effectiveness of different prompting strategies, share your methods and findings.

6. **Use Cases**: Provide specific examples of how you're using this system in your work or personal projects.

By sharing your experiences through these channels, you'll not only contribute to the Obsidian and LLM communities but also potentially connect with others working on similar projects. This can lead to valuable feedback, collaborations, and further improvements to your system.
