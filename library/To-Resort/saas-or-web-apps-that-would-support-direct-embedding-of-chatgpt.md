# Prompt

It's unlikely but are there any fully web based / SaaS tools that can do this? Is it possible to embed a web page into another one (maybe via an iframe)? If I could do that and have the note aspects I need that would work too

# Output

Based on the search results, there are a few SaaS tools and methods that can potentially meet your need for a **web-based platform** that can provide a **grid layout** and also support embedding external services like ChatGPT using an iframe. Here are some options:

### 1. **Gridstack.js**
**Gridstack.js** is a JavaScript library that allows you to create customizable and interactive grid layouts on a webpage. You could use this library as the foundation for a SaaS solution where you want to have a grid-like workspace—this could be implemented to create panes for **context snippets, prompts, outputs**, and even embed **external services like ChatGPT** in one of the panes using an iframe. It's well-suited for building dashboards where each component is draggable and resizable, which could be perfect for your needs when working with different types of data in a cohesive workspace.

This library allows for creating a flexible, widget-based grid system that can be hosted in the cloud, giving you the **flexibility to arrange the layout however you want** and include different components or services via iframes【202†source】.

### 2. **Grafana Dashboards Using iFrames**
**Grafana** is often used to create interactive dashboards, and it has various options to **embed its dashboards into other applications** via iframe. Although Grafana is more focused on data visualization, it could be configured to have a mixed-use setup where one panel in a grid displays text data (your context and prompt snippets) and another panel embeds a live instance of **ChatGPT** via an iframe. Grafana allows embedding either via direct links or **public dashboards**, which can be configured and shared across other web apps. For embedding, the `allow_embedding` setting can be enabled, making it possible to include Grafana panels as part of a broader integrated workspace【203†source】.

### 3. **Muuri**
**Muuri** is a JavaScript library that allows for responsive and interactive grid layouts. It can be used to create draggable and resizable panels, similar to **Gridstack.js**, but with a more dynamic approach. Muuri might be a suitable option if you want an environment where content can be moved around freely and where embedding external web services via an iframe is straightforward. Muuri is also lightweight and compatible with different browsers, which makes it a flexible option for creating a **dashboard-like workspace** where each element can be customized for your specific content needs【202†source】.

### Using iFrames to Embed Webpages
If you decide to use a **web-based tool or build a solution** where embedding is required, embedding an external webpage like **ChatGPT** into another webpage using an iframe is definitely possible. An iframe allows you to load an external page within a frame in your main webpage, effectively giving you the functionality of a **multi-pane interface**:

- To do this, you simply use HTML like:
  ```html
  <iframe src="https://chat.openai.com/" width="600" height="400"></iframe>
  ```
- This approach can be used in almost any modern CMS or web tool that allows embedding HTML content. Some knowledge of security implications (e.g., handling cross-origin requests) is necessary to ensure proper functionality without compromising the security of your content.

### Summary
For a **fully web-based/SaaS solution** that supports a grid-like layout and allows embedding an external service like ChatGPT, you can consider:

1. **Gridstack.js** or **Muuri** - Both are JavaScript libraries that can create a customizable grid layout that could work for your text-based workflow and embed external services via iframe.
2. **Grafana** - You could use its dashboard capabilities to set up panels that contain text and context documents while embedding other services like ChatGPT in other panes.

The key benefit of using tools like **Gridstack.js** or **Muuri** is their flexibility in creating a customized grid layout, where you can define each pane as needed, including integrating external services through iframes.
