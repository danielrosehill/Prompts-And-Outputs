**Summary of the prompt:** You are asking whether it is possible to perform a bare metal recovery using Clonezilla onto new hardware, where the new hardware involves different RAM and storage, but the same operating system (Fedora Workstation).

### **Bare Metal Recovery Using Clonezilla on New Hardware**

Yes, you can perform a **bare metal recovery** using **Clonezilla** onto new hardware, even if the RAM and storage hardware are different, provided that the core components of the system remain compatible (e.g., the CPU architecture). Clonezilla can restore the entire system, including the operating system, applications, configurations, and data, as long as the following conditions are met:

### **How Clonezilla Works in This Scenario**:

1. **Disk Imaging**: Clonezilla creates an image of your entire disk or partitions, including all the file systems, bootloaders, and system data. This image is then used to restore everything exactly as it was on a new machine.

2. **Hardware Compatibility**:
   - **New RAM**: No issue here—your system should boot and run without problems since RAM doesn’t affect the disk contents or operating system configuration.
   - **New Storage** (e.g., a new SSD or HDD): As long as the new storage is **larger than or the same size as** the original storage, Clonezilla will successfully restore the disk image. If the new storage is smaller, you'll need to resize partitions before creating the image.

3. **Drivers**: One potential issue can arise with hardware-specific drivers, especially with disk controllers, storage devices, and peripheral hardware:
   - If you’re moving between two systems that are mostly similar (e.g., same CPU architecture and GPU), it should work with minimal to no reconfiguration.
   - If the new storage device requires different drivers (e.g., switching from HDD to SSD or NVMe), Fedora’s built-in kernel modules and drivers should handle the hardware change automatically during boot.

### **Steps to Perform Bare Metal Recovery Using Clonezilla**:

1. **Create a Backup Image with Clonezilla**:
   - Use Clonezilla to create a **full disk image** of your current system. This will include the bootloader (GRUB), Fedora installation, and all configurations and user data.
   - The image will be stored on an external drive or network location.

2. **Prepare the New Hardware**:
   - Set up the new hardware (new RAM, new storage).
   - Ensure that the new storage device is large enough to accommodate the original disk image.

3. **Boot into Clonezilla on the New System**:
   - Boot the new system using a Clonezilla **live USB**.
   - Choose **restore** mode and point Clonezilla to the saved disk image.

4. **Restore the Disk Image**:
   - Clonezilla will restore the full image, including all partitions, file systems, and the bootloader (GRUB).
   - During restoration, Clonezilla will automatically write the image to the new storage, effectively cloning the old system onto the new hardware.

5. **Post-Restoration Steps**:
   - After restoring the image, boot into the Fedora Workstation.
   - Fedora’s kernel should detect and load the necessary drivers for the new hardware, such as for the new storage or RAM configuration.
   - If Fedora detects new hardware that requires additional drivers, it may install them automatically during boot or prompt you to install them.

6. **Partition Adjustment (Optional)**:
   - If the new storage device is **larger** than the original, you may want to expand the partitions to use the additional space. You can use tools like `gparted` or `fdisk` to resize partitions after restoring the image.

### **Considerations**:

- **GRUB Bootloader**: Clonezilla will restore the GRUB bootloader as part of the disk image. If you encounter bootloader issues (for instance, if the new hardware changes the drive IDs), you may need to reinstall or reconfigure GRUB using a Fedora live environment.
  
- **Hardware-Specific Drivers**: If your new storage hardware or any other peripheral hardware (e.g., GPUs, Wi-Fi cards) is very different, you may need to manually install or update drivers, though Fedora typically handles this automatically via the Linux kernel.

- **UEFI vs. BIOS**: Ensure the new machine’s firmware settings (UEFI/BIOS) match the original system’s setup. For example, if the original system used UEFI, the new machine should also be in UEFI mode to ensure a smooth restoration.

### **Conclusion**:

Yes, you can perform a **bare metal recovery** using **Clonezilla** onto new hardware with different RAM and storage. As long as the new storage device is large enough to hold the image, Clonezilla will restore the system without issues. After the restore, Fedora Workstation will likely handle any hardware changes automatically. You may need to adjust the partition size or install new drivers if there are significant hardware changes (e.g., moving from HDD to NVMe or using new peripheral devices).
