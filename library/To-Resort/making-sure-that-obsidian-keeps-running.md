If Obsidian is still closing on Android despite disabling background battery restrictions, here are a few more troubleshooting steps you could try:

1. Whitelist the app from battery optimization: Go to Settings > Battery > Battery Optimization, and ensure Obsidian is set to "Not optimized" or whitelisted.


2. Adjust app permissions: Check that Obsidian has all necessary permissions. Go to Settings > Apps > Obsidian > Permissions, and ensure any relevant permissions like storage and notifications are granted.


3. Lock the app in memory: Some Android devices allow you to lock an app in memory. Open Obsidian, open the Recent Apps view, and tap the padlock icon (if available) on Obsidian to prevent it from being killed by the system.


4. Disable Power Saving Mode: Ensure your phone's power-saving modes are off or configured to allow Obsidian to function without being killed when idle.


5. Use a third-party app to manage background processes: Apps like Greenify or Tasker can be configured to keep Obsidian running or restart it after being closed.


6. Check developer options: If you have developer mode enabled, go to Settings > Developer Options, and under Background Process Limit, set the limit to standard or higher.


7. Check for app or system updates: Ensure Obsidian and your phone's operating system are fully up to date. Sometimes app crashes can be caused by incompatibility with the OS version.



If none of these resolve the issue, reinstalling the app might also help clear any possible configuration issues.
