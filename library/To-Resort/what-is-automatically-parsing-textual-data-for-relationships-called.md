**Summary of the prompt:**
You asked what the process of structuring unstructured textual data for a graph database is called and whether there are any SaaS tools available for this.

### The Process: **Knowledge Extraction and Graph Construction**

The process of analyzing unstructured or semi-structured text data to identify entities, extract relationships, and structure the information for use in a graph database is typically referred to as:

1. **Knowledge Extraction (KE)**:
   - **Knowledge Extraction** involves **identifying key entities, concepts, and relationships** within unstructured data. It goes beyond basic text parsing by trying to understand the context and meaning of the text.
   - The output is structured data (e.g., entities like "Python" or "Machine Learning" and relationships like "Python is used for Machine Learning") that can be directly mapped to graph databases.

2. **Knowledge Graph Construction (KGC)**:
   - **Knowledge Graph Construction** takes the extracted entities and relationships and organizes them into a **graph format**. This is the process of turning extracted information into a network of interconnected nodes and edges.
   - Knowledge graphs provide a way to **store, search, and visualize** the relationships between different entities, making it possible to see how pieces of knowledge are interrelated.

3. **Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Relationship Extraction**:
   - **NER** is a specific technique within knowledge extraction where the goal is to identify specific entities (like names of people, organizations, locations) from the text.
   - **Relationship Extraction** then focuses on finding and defining the connections between these entities. Together, they form the basis for graph construction.

### SaaS Tools for Knowledge Extraction and Graph Construction:

Several Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) tools exist that can facilitate this process, often by providing automated pipelines for extracting, structuring, and storing data in graph formats. Here are some notable options:

1. **PoolParty**
   - **Description**: PoolParty is a **semantic middleware** platform that specializes in **knowledge graph construction**. It helps extract data from unstructured text, understand the semantic relationships, and build structured graphs that can be ingested into graph databases.
   - **Features**:
     - **Semantic Text Mining**: Automated entity extraction, concept identification, and taxonomy building.
     - **Integration**: Supports integration with graph databases like **Neo4j**, **RDF triple stores**, and enterprise systems.
     - **Visual Graph Exploration**: Provides a visual interface to explore the created knowledge graph.
   - **Use Case**: You can feed your markdown repository into PoolParty, and it will automatically extract entities and map out the logical relationships, providing a graph-based structure that can be directly ingested into databases.

2. **Expert.ai Cogito**
   - **Description**: **Cogito** from Expert.ai is a **semantic AI platform** that provides advanced **text analytics** and **knowledge graph construction**. It can parse documents, extract entities, and discover relationships automatically.
   - **Features**:
     - **Natural Language Understanding**: Uses advanced algorithms to understand the context of the text and extract knowledge.
     - **Knowledge Graphs**: Automatically creates graphs based on extracted entities and relationships, which can be exported to various formats.
     - **Cloud-Based**: Fully cloud-based, providing easy integration with existing workflows.
   - **Use Case**: Process a collection of markdown files, and Cogito will help build a graph of interconnected topics and entities, which can then be used for deeper analysis or search.

3. **Diffbot**
   - **Description**: Diffbot is a **Knowledge-as-a-Service (KaaS)** platform that creates knowledge graphs from web data and other sources, including text documents. It uses **machine learning and computer vision** to automatically identify entities and build structured data.
   - **Features**:
     - **Automatic Entity Extraction**: Extracts and identifies entities from text, building a detailed knowledge graph.
     - **Graph Query API**: Provides access to its pre-built knowledge graph and allows integration with your own data.
     - **Entity Linking and Deduplication**: Connects entities to existing data, ensuring consistency and reducing duplicates.
   - **Use Case**: Use Diffbotâ€™s tools to automatically analyze and convert markdown notes into graph data, connecting related concepts across your repository.

4. **Amazon Neptune ML**
   - **Description**: **Amazon Neptune** is a managed graph database service that now integrates **Machine Learning (Neptune ML)** to help users extract and build relationships in their data. While not strictly for text analysis, it can be combined with AWS tools to achieve the desired outcome.
   - **Integration**:
     - Use **Amazon Comprehend** (AWS's NLP service) to extract entities and relationships from text.
     - Store and query the extracted data in **Amazon Neptune**, creating a graph structure that can be explored or extended.
     - **Machine Learning** can then help predict relationships and infer connections based on existing graph data.
   - **Use Case**: Use Amazon Comprehend to process markdown files, extract entities, and store the data in Neptune, building a graph that can be extended and queried.

5. **Ontotext Platform**
   - **Description**: Ontotext is a **semantic graph database** platform that integrates with **text analysis** tools to create knowledge graphs. It uses **natural language processing** to extract knowledge and builds structured graph data.
   - **Features**:
     - **Text Mining & NLP**: Understands unstructured data and converts it into structured graph formats.
     - **Semantic Enrichment**: Allows for the addition of taxonomies and ontologies to improve the quality of the graph.
     - **SPARQL Support**: Queries are done using **SPARQL**, which is ideal for linking and exploring relationships in complex datasets.
   - **Use Case**: Automatically analyze markdown notes and build a comprehensive, structured graph that can be visualized or queried.

### Benefits of Using SaaS Tools for Knowledge Extraction:
1. **Automation**: These tools save significant time by automating the process of parsing and understanding text, identifying entities, and inferring relationships.
2. **Scalability**: They can handle large datasets efficiently, making it easier to scale up from a few notes to thousands without needing to rewrite scripts or code.
3. **Seamless Integration**: Most tools provide APIs, making it easy to integrate the process with your existing workflow and databases.
4. **Advanced Analysis**: SaaS tools often come with additional features, such as **machine learning** and **AI-powered insights**, that go beyond basic text parsing to offer deeper understanding and richer connections.

### Recommendation:
For your goal of converting markdown notes into a graph-based structure, consider starting with **GraphAware NLP** for a more hands-on, open-source approach, or explore SaaS platforms like **Diffbot** or **PoolParty** if you're looking for automated, enterprise-level solutions. These services can intelligently extract entities and relationships from your data, enabling you to build a navigable graph without extensive manual effort.
