The **502 Bad Gateway** error typically means that one server acting as a gateway or proxy received an invalid response from the upstream server. Here are some common reasons why you're seeing this error after enabling **HTTPS** and how you can troubleshoot it:

### **Common Causes and Solutions for 502 Bad Gateway with Home Assistant**

1. **SSL Misconfiguration**:
   - The most likely reason for a **502 error** when switching to **HTTPS** is a misconfigured SSL certificate on either **Home Assistant** or the **gateway**.
   - **Solution**: Ensure that **Home Assistant** has a valid SSL certificate configured and that the Cloudflare tunnel knows how to handle it.
     - If you're using **Let's Encrypt**, the certificate needs to be correctly referenced in the **`configuration.yaml`** file of Home Assistant.
     - **Home Assistant Configuration Example**:
       ```yaml
       http:
         ssl_certificate: /ssl/fullchain.pem
         ssl_key: /ssl/privkey.pem
       ```
       - Ensure that the certificate paths are correct and accessible.

2. **Mismatched Protocols**:
   - If your **Cloudflare Tunnel** or the **gateway** is trying to access Home Assistant over **HTTP**, but Home Assistant is configured for **HTTPS**, the connection will fail.
   - **Solution**: Update the route in **Cloudflare** to use **HTTPS**:
     - Ensure that your **route** in Cloudflare Zero Trust points to **`https://192.168.1.3:8123`** instead of **`http://`**.

3. **Cloudflare Configuration**:
   - Cloudflare may not be able to validate your SSL if **Full (Strict)** SSL is enabled without a valid certificate on the Home Assistant side.
   - **Solution**:
     - **Cloudflare SSL Mode**: Set the **SSL/TLS encryption mode** to **Full** (instead of **Full (Strict)**) in the Cloudflare dashboard. This way, Cloudflare will connect using encryption but won’t require a valid certificate from your server.

4. **Nginx Reverse Proxy Configuration (Optional)**:
   - If you’re using **Nginx** as a reverse proxy between Cloudflare and Home Assistant, there could be issues with how the reverse proxy is configured to handle SSL.
   - **Solution**: Ensure that the **Nginx** configuration forwards **HTTPS** requests correctly.
     - Sample Nginx configuration for Home Assistant:
       ```nginx
       server {
           listen 443 ssl;
           server_name ha.testhomewebsite.com;

           ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/ha.testhomewebsite.com/fullchain.pem;
           ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/ha.testhomewebsite.com/privkey.pem;

           location / {
               proxy_pass http://192.168.1.3:8123;
               proxy_set_header Host $host;
               proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
               proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
           }
       }
       ```
     - Make sure the **proxy_pass** directive points to **HTTP** (`http://192.168.1.3:8123`) since Nginx handles SSL termination.

5. **Firewall or Port Issues**:
   - If **port 8123** is blocked for incoming traffic on **HTTPS**, it will result in a **502 error**.
   - **Solution**:
     - Ensure that **port 8123** is open for traffic internally and that no firewall rules are blocking access.

### **Steps to Troubleshoot**:
1. **Check SSL Configuration**:
   - Ensure that **Home Assistant** has the correct paths to the SSL certificate and private key, and that these files are valid and accessible.

2. **Adjust Cloudflare SSL Mode**:
   - Set the SSL mode to **Full** in Cloudflare and test again to see if the **502 error** persists.

3. **Update Routes to Use HTTPS**:
   - Ensure the **Cloudflare Route** and any proxy configurations point to **HTTPS** if Home Assistant is set to use SSL.

4. **Test Locally**:
   - From a device on the **local network**, try accessing Home Assistant using the **HTTPS URL** directly:
     ```bash
     curl -k https://192.168.1.3:8123
     ```
     - Use `-k` to ignore SSL verification temporarily, just to check if the server is responding.

### **Summary**:
- A **502 Bad Gateway** error often indicates an issue with how SSL and communication between the **Cloudflare Tunnel**, **gateway**, and **Home Assistant** are configured.
- Make sure **SSL certificates** are set correctly, **Cloudflare's SSL settings** match, and all **routes** and **proxy settings** use the proper protocol (HTTP/HTTPS).
- Testing each component independently (Cloudflare, direct access, SSL validity) can help isolate the cause of the problem.
