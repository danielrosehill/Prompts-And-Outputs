# Prompt

Here is an Airtable view. It shows guests attending an upcoming event. I am missing two datapoints for a lot of the attendees - their job title and their LinkedIn profile URL. Can you suggest a smart way to add these ... perhaps using AI?

# Output

To fill in the missing data points (job titles and LinkedIn profile URLs) for the attendees in your Airtable, hereâ€™s a smart approach using AI:

### Step 1: Export Data to CSV
1. **Export** your Airtable data to a CSV file. You can do this by selecting the appropriate view in Airtable and exporting it to a CSV file.

### Step 2: Utilize AI Tools for Data Enrichment
2. **Use a Data Enrichment Tool**:
   - **LinkedIn API** (requires access): If you have API access, you can programmatically fetch LinkedIn profiles and job titles using the attendees' email addresses. LinkedIn's API allows you to search for profiles based on various data points.
   - **Clearbit or FullContact API**: These services can enrich your data by finding LinkedIn profiles and job titles based on email addresses.
   - **ChatGPT or OpenAI API**: With some prompt engineering, you can use AI to suggest possible job titles or even attempt to match LinkedIn profiles by using provided information. 

### Step 3: Manual Check and AI-Assisted Searches
3. **Semi-automated Approach**:
   - **ChatGPT or Bing AI**: You can use a language model to search the web for specific people based on their name and organization, and attempt to locate their LinkedIn profiles and job titles. For example, prompt the AI with something like: "Find the LinkedIn profile for [Full Name] who works at [Organization]."
   - **Web Scraping** (if permissible): Tools like Scrapy or BeautifulSoup can automate the search for LinkedIn profiles based on names and company information.

### Step 4: Import Data Back to Airtable
4. **Update Your Airtable**:
   - Once you have the enriched data, import the updated CSV back into Airtable. Use the "Import" feature, ensuring you map the columns correctly to update existing records rather than creating new ones.

### Bonus Tip: Automate Future Enrichments
For future events or similar tasks, you could create an automation in Airtable using integrations with tools like Zapier or Make (formerly Integromat) to automatically enrich any new records as they are added.

This method combines AI and existing data enrichment tools to fill in the gaps efficiently. Would you like help with a specific step, like setting up an API or crafting AI prompts?## Extracted Prompts
