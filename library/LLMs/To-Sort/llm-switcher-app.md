# Prompt

I would like to create an application for my own use in Fedora Linux. 

This application would allow the user to toggle a browser window between a list of URLs that the user could configure in the application. 

The core of the application would be a browser window. And above it would be a horizontal row of buttons.

In the configuration window, the user could configure the URLs for the three panes. 

When the user clicks a button, he transitions into that pane. 

The browser which powers this can be anything. I use Fedora Workstation 40.

If you can think of a way to make this work, please generate the script for the program. Focus on making an attractive and modern UI.
