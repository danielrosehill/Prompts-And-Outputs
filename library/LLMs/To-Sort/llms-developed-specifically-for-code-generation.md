*Note: this repository consists of the outputs of large language models (LLMs). In many cases, these are unedited or minimally edited. The information provided is for demonstrative purposes only and is intended to highlight constraints and capabilities in LLM applications and prompt engineering strategies.*


# Prompt

Please provide a list of LLMs which have been specifically devised with the intention of generating code from natural language? Among these, which is the most mature and best known model?

# Output

Based on the information provided in the search results and the image, here's a list of LLMs specifically devised for generating code from natural language, along with an assessment of the most mature and well-known model:

1. OpenAI Codex
2. Code LLama (various versions including 7B, 13B, 34B, and 70B)
3. StarCoder and StarCoder2
4. Polycoder
5. GitHub Copilot (powered by OpenAI Codex)
6. Replit Ghostwriter
7. WizardCoder (various versions)
8. Mistral 7B & Mixtral 8X7B
9. CodeT5
10. Tabnine
11. AI2sql (specifically for SQL code generation)
12. Enzyme (focused on web development)

Among these, the most mature and best-known models appear to be:

1. OpenAI Codex: This is widely recognized as one of the pioneers in code generation from natural language. It powers GitHub Copilot, which has gained significant adoption in the developer community.

2. Code LLama: Developed by Meta, this is a more recent but highly capable model. The latest 70B parameter version is particularly noteworthy for its performance.

3. GitHub Copilot: While powered by OpenAI Codex, it has become a distinct and widely used tool in its own right.

OpenAI Codex/GitHub Copilot is likely the most mature and best-known model overall, given its widespread adoption and integration into popular development environments. However, Code LLama is rapidly gaining recognition, especially with its open-source nature and recent performance improvements.

It's worth noting that the field of AI code generation is rapidly evolving, and new models or updated versions of existing models could quickly change this landscape.
 Certainly! I'll create a comparison matrix highlighting the similarities and differences between the main models based on the information provided in the image and the data we've processed. Here's a detailed comparison:

| Model      | Task                  | Score | Year | Similarities                                   | Differences                                            |
|------------|----------------------|-------|------|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| O1-mini    | Debug like a Human   | 99.39 | 2024 | - Same task as O1-preview, GPT-4o, GPT-4, GPT-3.5 | - Highest score (tied with O1-preview)                 |
|            |                      |       |      | - Same year as most models                     | - Different from AgentCoder in task                    |
| O1-preview | Debug like a Human   | 99.39 | 2024 | - Same as O1-mini in all aspects               | - Highest score (tied with O1-mini)                    |
| GPT-4o     | Debug like a Human   | 98.2  | 2024 | - Same task as O1-mini, O1-preview, GPT-4, GPT-3.5 | - Third highest score                                  |
|            |                      |       |      | - Same year as most models                     | - Slightly lower score than O1 variants                |
| GPT-4      | Debug like a Human   | 96.9  | 2024 | - Same task as O1-mini, O1-preview, GPT-4o, GPT-3.5 | - Fourth highest score                                 |
|            |                      |       |      | - Same year as most models                     | - Lower score than GPT-4o                              |
| AgentCoder | Multi-Agent-based    | 96.3  | 2023 | - Based on GPT-4                               | - Different task from all other models                 |
|            | Code Generation      |       |      |                                                | - Only model from 2023                                 |
|            |                      |       |      |                                                | - Unique approach (multi-agent-based)                  |
| GPT-3.5    | Debug like a Human   | 95.1  | 2024 | - Same task as O1-mini, O1-preview, GPT-4o, GPT-4 | - Lowest score among the compared models               |
|            |                      |       |      | - Same year as most models                     | - Older version compared to GPT-4 variants             |

Key observations:
1. Task similarity: 5 out of 6 models focus on "Debug like a Human" task, with AgentCoder being the exception.
2. Performance: O1-mini and O1-preview lead with the highest scores, followed by GPT-4o, GPT-4, AgentCoder, and GPT-3.5.
3. Year: All models except AgentCoder are from 2024, indicating recent developments.
4. Unique approach: AgentCoder stands out with its multi-agent-based approach and different task focus.
5. GPT variants: The comparison includes multiple GPT variants (GPT-4o, GPT-4, GPT-3.5) with varying performance levels.
6. O1 variants: O1-mini and O1-preview show identical performance, suggesting they might be closely related or iterations of the same model.

This matrix highlights the focus on debugging tasks among most models, the performance variations between different GPT versions, and the unique position of AgentCoder in this comparison.
