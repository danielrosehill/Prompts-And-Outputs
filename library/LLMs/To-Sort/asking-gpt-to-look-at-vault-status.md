Here's a random file I pulled out of my vault and its contents and the file menu. It looks good to me. Can you determine anything about the data?
# Output


From the information you've provided, along with the screenshot of the **file content** and **file list in Backblaze B2**, it looks like the data stored in your vault is **encrypted**. Here's why:

### **Encrypted Data Indicators**:
1. **Garbled File Names**:
   - The file names displayed in the **Backblaze B2 file list** are clearly **not in plain text** (e.g., `0WUL1UUMOKvwzkeCVosF6w`, `1EspKBd0xAQfFcAd4jpgWQ`), which suggests the files are **encrypted** or **obfuscated** at rest. This would be typical if you're using a sync tool or plugin that encrypts files before uploading.

2. **Unreadable File Content**:
   - The file you opened (`vaultdata_0WUL1UUMOKvwzkeCVosF6w`) contains **garbled, unreadable characters**. If this file is supposed to be a plain-text or Markdown file, the contents would be legible. Since it's not, this strongly indicates that the data within the file is encrypted.

### **Conclusion**:
Based on the garbled file names and unreadable contents, it appears that the data in your Backblaze B2 bucket is encrypted and not stored in plain text. This is a good sign if you're aiming to ensure that your data is protected at rest.

### **Verification**:
If you're using a tool or plugin (such as Obsidian with a sync or encryption plugin) to manage your vault and you expect encryption, this result confirms that your encryption mechanism is working as expected.

Would you like to confirm the encryption settings in your sync plugin or tool, or is there any further action you'd like to take? Let me know!
