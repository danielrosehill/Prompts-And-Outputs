# Prompt

I use ChatGPT throughout the day and find it very helpful. However, sometimes I run into usage caps. As you know, I would also like a more robust system for storing outputs and prompts than is provided through the tool. I keep wondering whether there are more advanced versions of ChatGPT that are intended for more intensive use in enterprise and business environments where my requirements for data retention and searchability might be commonplace rather than unusual. Any thoughts?
