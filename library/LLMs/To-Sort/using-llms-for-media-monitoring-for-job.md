# Prompt

Back to my job. Do you have any ideas for how I could use LLMs and AI to make media monitoring more enjoyable. Instead of getting a large list of mostly irrelevant Google Alerts, I'd love to get a more narrative driven report daily summarising the news around certain topics. Would that be possible?

# Output

Yes, it's definitely possible to use LLMs and AI to create more enjoyable, narrative-driven daily reports for media monitoring. Here’s how you could approach it:

### 1. **AI Summarization with Narrative Flair**
   - **How**: Use LLMs (like GPT-4) to create a pipeline where all the news stories you monitor (via RSS feeds, APIs, or even Google Alerts) are aggregated and summarized into a more human-friendly, story-like format.
   - **What you get**: Instead of a list of headlines, the AI could generate a coherent narrative summarizing key trends and events of the day. For example, it could present the day’s news around financial sustainability as a "daily briefing," discussing how different events connect, what the implications might be, and the most important takeaways.
   - **Implementation**: You could use a tool like **Zapier** or **Make (formerly Integromat)** to pull content from RSS feeds or news APIs and feed it into GPT-4 or another LLM for summarization and formatting into a cohesive report.

### 2. **Create a Conversational Briefing**
   - **How**: Instead of a static report, imagine receiving a conversational summary where the AI plays the role of a news anchor or briefing officer. The report could be formatted as if it's a conversation between you and the AI, with the AI "telling" you the day's key stories.
   - **What you get**: A friendly, easy-to-read conversation, similar to a back-and-forth interview where the AI highlights relevant news and explains how different stories connect.
   - **Implementation**: You could use GPT-4’s conversational abilities to reformat your daily media inputs into a dialogue format. This could be built into a custom interface or even delivered via email or chat apps (e.g., Slack, WhatsApp) for daily briefings.

### 3. **Interactive News Q&A**
   - **How**: Instead of getting a static report, use an LLM to generate a daily news overview and allow you to ask follow-up questions. For example, after receiving the report, you could ask: “How does this affect sustainable finance?” or “What are the latest trends in green bonds?”
   - **What you get**: An AI-powered assistant that not only summarizes the news but also provides deeper insights based on your specific questions. It turns media monitoring into an interactive experience.
   - **Implementation**: Create a chatbot using an LLM like GPT-4, connected to your news sources. You could ask follow-up questions after receiving the summary or dive deeper into any specific topic.

### 4. **AI-Generated Visual Reports**
   - **How**: Take your narrative-driven summaries a step further by incorporating visual elements. AI can generate infographics or visual representations of key trends (e.g., how many mentions a particular keyword received in the past week, graphs showing trends in financial sustainability topics).
   - **What you get**: A visually engaging report that not only tells the news story but also shows it. This can make digesting trends more enjoyable, especially if you prefer visuals to text-heavy lists.
   - **Implementation**: Combine a tool like **ChartGPT** with text summarization to create a report that includes both written analysis and charts or graphs. Integrate this with a tool like **Canva** or **Piktochart** for beautifully designed daily reports.

### 5. **Themed Daily Narratives (Storytelling)**
   - **How**: Set up your AI to craft daily reports with themes or storylines. For example, it could narrate the news as if it’s an unfolding story: “Today, in the world of sustainable finance, a few key players took the stage. Here’s how their actions could affect the market in the coming days…” 
   - **What you get**: The report becomes less about facts and more about weaving a story that connects key developments and predictions. This narrative approach makes the information more engaging and memorable.
   - **Implementation**: LLMs like GPT-4 can generate this type of thematic storytelling. You can prompt the model to emphasize connections between events and provide the “bigger picture” rather than just summarizing the day's news.

### 6. **Smart Filtering with LLMs**
   - **How**: LLMs can be used to filter out irrelevant content by understanding the context of the news that matters to you. You can train a model or fine-tune prompts so that it automatically identifies the most significant stories around financial sustainability based on your criteria (e.g., long-term impact, mentions of specific companies, etc.).
   - **What you get**: A personalized summary that is highly relevant, saving you from skimming irrelevant articles or receiving long lists of news.
   - **Implementation**: Set up a news monitoring pipeline using an LLM to act as a smart filter before generating the daily summary. Tools like **Zapier** or **Make** can help with this.

### 7. **Voice-Driven Summaries**
   - **How**: Create a system where the LLM not only generates the narrative but also reads it aloud. This could make news consumption more enjoyable if you prefer auditory over textual formats.
   - **What you get**: A personalized daily podcast where your sloth tutor (or another avatar) reads the day’s relevant news and adds context.
   - **Implementation**: Use AI tools like **Murf** or **Resemble.ai** for voice generation, combined with the narrative summary generated by an LLM. You could deliver this via a podcast-style format or audio email.

By building a system like this, you can transform the often tedious task of media monitoring into something more interactive, visual, and even fun. If you want to keep it simple, start with LLM-driven daily summaries and layer on more creative elements as you go!
