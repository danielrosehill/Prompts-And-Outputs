# Prompt

For the idea of creating graph databases showing clusters in AI/LLM ... would there by any way to access this data at an affordable price (ie, I'd need to figure out a way to get some kind of database of startups and then find a database to host the cluster). I can imagine that it could be prohibitively expensive. But if not, could you suggest some potential ways to try out the idea

# Output

Accessing data for creating graph databases that show clusters in AI/LLM ecosystems can indeed be expensive, but there are some more affordable or even free options to explore. Here's a breakdown of potential approaches and tools you could use to try out your idea without breaking the bank:

### 1. **Accessing Startups Data Affordably**
   - **Crunchbase (Free Tier & API Access)**: Crunchbase offers a free tier with basic access to their data. You can manually explore companies and clusters of startups, and their API also allows some free access, though it may be limited. It’s a good starting point for experimenting with startup data.
   - **AngelList**: AngelList is another platform that offers a lot of data on startups, including AI-focused companies. It’s free to use and could be a good place to gather initial data on relevant companies.
   - **Mattermark (Free Data Reports)**: Although Mattermark is a paid service, they occasionally release free reports on tech ecosystems and startups that can give you insight into the landscape of companies working on generative AI and LLM.
   - **OpenCorporates**: This is the largest open database of companies worldwide, which can be used to explore company relationships. While it may not have all the details that Crunchbase or PitchBook would have, it’s a free resource that you could use to map basic company clusters.
   - **GitHub repositories for startup lists**: Some GitHub repositories curate lists of AI and tech startups. You can use these as seed data to experiment with graph databases.

### 2. **Storing and Visualizing the Data**
   - **Neo4j (Community Edition)**: Neo4j is a powerful graph database platform with a free **community edition**. You can use this to build your graph of companies and relationships between them. The free tier allows for fairly sophisticated graph analysis and visualization.
   - **Dgraph (Open Source)**: Dgraph is another open-source graph database that could be used to map company clusters. It’s designed to be scalable and performant, and you won’t have to pay for it if you host it yourself.
   - **Amazon Neptune (Free Tier)**: AWS Neptune is Amazon’s managed graph database service. While it’s not free indefinitely, AWS offers a free tier that allows you to explore graph database functionality without upfront cost. If you’re already familiar with AWS, this could be a good way to test out the concept.
   - **ArangoDB (Open Source)**: ArangoDB is a multi-model database that supports graph databases as well as document and key-value models. It's open-source and could be a versatile option for your project.
   - **JanusGraph (Open Source)**: JanusGraph is an open-source graph database that supports large-scale, distributed graphs. It works well with other open-source tools like Apache Cassandra and Elasticsearch, making it a powerful (and free) choice.

### 3. **Finding Integration and Partnership Data**
   - **Partnerships Databases (Reveal, Crossbeam)**: Platforms like **Reveal** and **Crossbeam** track company integrations and partnerships. These platforms offer free tiers, though typically for B2B collaborations. They may not provide exhaustive data, but you could use them as a starting point to track which AI startups are partnering with or integrating with other companies.
   - **Publicly Available Integration Data**: Many SaaS companies publicly list their integrations, which you can scrape or collect manually. You can compile this data to map out relationships between startups working in the AI/LLM space.
   - **Web Scraping with Python**: If you’re comfortable with Python, you can use libraries like **BeautifulSoup** and **Selenium** to scrape data from public sources like company websites, press releases, and tech blogs about integrations and partnerships.

### 4. **Affordable Cloud Hosting**
   - **Heroku (Free Tier)**: If you need a place to host your graph database or web app to explore clusters, Heroku offers a free tier with limited resources that should be enough to get you started. You can deploy Neo4j or similar databases on Heroku to test your concept.
   - **Google Cloud (Free Tier)**: Google Cloud’s free tier provides credits for various services, including cloud hosting for databases. This could allow you to run a graph database like Neo4j or ArangoDB at minimal cost.
   - **DigitalOcean (Low-Cost)**: DigitalOcean offers affordable cloud infrastructure, and with as little as $5 per month, you can host your own graph database instance. They also offer some initial free credits to get started.

### 5. **Experimenting with Pre-built Graph Tools**
   - **Kumu**: Kumu is a graph visualization tool that offers a free tier for small-scale projects. It’s not a full-fledged graph database, but it’s great for visualizing networks and relationships, allowing you to test the feasibility of your idea.
   - **Graph Commons**: As mentioned earlier, Graph Commons allows you to create and explore relationship networks for free. You could use it to manually map AI companies and partnerships.
   - **Sigma.js**: Sigma.js is a JavaScript library for graph visualization that you can use to build interactive graph-based web applications. It’s free and customizable, allowing you to experiment with graph visualizations of AI company ecosystems.

### How to Try Out the Idea:

1. **Collect Initial Data**: Start by gathering data from free or low-cost sources like Crunchbase, AngelList, and scraping public integration data from company websites.
2. **Seed the Graph**: Use an open-source graph database like Neo4j or ArangoDB to start building a graph of AI companies, their investors, integrations, and partnerships.
3. **Visualize the Ecosystem**: Use tools like Graph Commons or Sigma.js to create a visual map of the relationships between companies. You can then explore how AI/LLM ecosystems cluster around certain partnerships or technological integrations.
4. **Expand Iteratively**: As you gain access to more data or receive feedback, you can expand your graph database to include more companies and deeper integrations.

By starting with open-source tools and free-tier data sources, you can experiment with mapping AI/LLM clusters without incurring high costs. This will allow you to validate your concept and potentially attract interest from investors or partners later on.
