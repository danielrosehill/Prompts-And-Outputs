On Android, you can use the built-in Split Screen feature to run Obsidian and ChatGPT side by side. Here's how you can do it:

Method 1: Using Android's Native Split Screen Feature

1. Open ChatGPT: Launch the ChatGPT app.


2. Enter Split Screen Mode:

Tap the Recents/Overview button (the square or the three-line icon at the bottom of your screen).

Find ChatGPT in your list of recent apps.

Long-press on the ChatGPT app's icon at the top of its window.

Select Split screen or Open in split screen view from the dropdown menu.



3. Open Obsidian: In the other half of the screen, select Obsidian from your list of recent apps or the app drawer.



Both apps should now run side by side. You can drag the dividing line between the two apps to adjust the size of each window.

Method 2: Using Third-Party Apps for Split Screen Management

If you want more advanced control over split-screen multitasking, you can try third-party apps like:

1. Split Screen Launcher:

This app lets you create shortcuts to open two apps in split screen simultaneously. It simplifies the process of quickly opening your preferred app pairs.

Install the app from the Play Store, then create a split-screen shortcut for ChatGPT and Obsidian.



2. Edge Gestures:

This app adds gestures to your Android device, allowing you to launch split-screen mode more easily or switch between split-screen apps with customizable swipes or taps.



3. Taskbar:

Taskbar is a utility that allows you to launch apps in free-form windows, which can be useful for side-by-side multitasking, especially on tablets or large-screen devices.


These methods should give you more flexibility in keeping both apps active and visible.
