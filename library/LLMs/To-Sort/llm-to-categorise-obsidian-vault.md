*Note: this repository consists of the outputs of large language models (LLMs). In many cases, these are unedited or minimally edited. The information provided is for demonstrative purposes only and is intended to highlight constraints and capabilities in LLM applications and prompt engineering strategies.*


# Prompt

Yes, you can run a local LLM over your Obsidian vault with around 1500 markdown files to categorize and find specific content, such as technical setup guides. Several open-source LLMs could handle this task, especially those optimized for document analysis. Below is a breakdown of how you can achieve this:

# Output

Yes, you can run a **local LLM** over your **Obsidian vault** with around 1500 markdown files to categorize and find specific content, such as technical setup guides. Several **open-source LLMs** could handle this task, especially those optimized for document analysis. Below is a breakdown of how you can achieve this:

### **LLM Recommendations for Your Project**
#### **1. GPT-J (6B)**
- **Why GPT-J?**:
  - **Size**: 6 billion parameters, making it powerful enough to handle text classification tasks.
  - **Capabilities**: GPT-J is effective at understanding natural language and could be used to identify and categorize technical documents within a vault of markdown files.
  - **Deployment**: You can run GPT-J locally with moderate computational resources. With **32GB RAM** and **12GB VRAM**, this model should perform well, especially when used with **quantization** (e.g., **8-bit** or **16-bit**).
  - **Cost**: Free to run locally once installed, though setting up hardware infrastructure and time are considerations.

#### **2. LLaMA (7B or 13B)**
- **Why LLaMA?**:
  - **Size**: 7B or 13B parameters.
  - **Capabilities**: LLaMA performs well at general text understanding, categorization, and contextual analysis. It can be fine-tuned for specific use cases like finding and categorizing technical setup guides.
  - **Deployment**: You can run **LLaMA-7B** with your hardware setup. It supports GPU acceleration with **FP16 precision** or quantized modes, which reduce the memory footprint.
  - **Cost**: LLaMA is open-source and free to deploy locally, but requires setup time.

#### **3. BLOOM (7B)**
- **Why BLOOM?**:
  - **Size**: 7B parameters.
  - **Capabilities**: Multilingual, powerful for processing large text corpora. BLOOM can be used for categorizing and classifying markdown files based on their contents.
  - **Deployment**: **BLOOM-7B** is large but can run on local machines with hardware like yours using techniques like **GPU offloading** and **quantization**.
  - **Cost**: Free, hosted on **Hugging Face** for easy access.

#### **4. GPT-Neo (2.7B)**
- **Why GPT-Neo?**:
  - **Size**: 2.7 billion parameters.
  - **Capabilities**: Less resource-intensive than GPT-J or LLaMA but can still handle document classification and extraction tasks efficiently.
  - **Deployment**: Easier to run on systems with less VRAM, so GPT-Neo could be a more lightweight option.
  - **Cost**: Free to use with local deployment.

### **How to Deploy the LLM for This Task**

#### **1. Environment Setup**
To run these models locally, you need to:
- Install **Python** (version 3.7 or above) and **PyTorch** (or TensorFlow, depending on the model).
- Install the **Hugging Face Transformers** library to load models easily.
  ```bash
  pip install transformers
  ```

#### **2. Load the Model**
For any model (e.g., **GPT-J**), you can use the following basic Python script to load the model and tokenizer:
```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM

# Load the model and tokenizer
model_name = "EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B"  # Or any other model from Hugging Face
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Optional: move the model to GPU
model.to("cuda")

# Load your Obsidian markdown files
import os

markdown_files = []
for root, dirs, files in os.walk("/path/to/your/obsidian/vault"):
    for file in files:
        if file.endswith(".md"):
            with open(os.path.join(root, file), 'r') as f:
                markdown_files.append(f.read())

# Use the model to categorize or classify technical guides (example prompt)
prompt = "Classify the following markdown file as 'Technical Setup Guide' or 'Other':\n\n"

for file in markdown_files:
    inputs = tokenizer(prompt + file, return_tensors="pt").to("cuda")
    outputs = model.generate(inputs.input_ids, max_length=300)
    print(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True))
```

#### **3. Fine-Tuning or Task-Specific Prompting**
- **Fine-Tuning**: If you want more accurate results, you can fine-tune the model on a smaller dataset of technical documents. This involves retraining the model slightly for categorizing markdown files.
- **Prompt Engineering**: Without fine-tuning, you can craft a prompt that helps the model categorize markdown files. For instance:
  - "Identify if the following markdown document contains technical setup instructions."
  - Or, "Summarize the following markdown document and identify if it contains a technical guide."

#### **4. Memory and Performance Considerations**
To manage large files and performance:
- Use **quantization** (8-bit models) to reduce memory consumption:
  ```python
  pip install bitsandbytes
  model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name, load_in_8bit=True, device_map="auto")
  ```

- For larger models like **LLaMA-13B**, enable **GPU offloading** or use **PyTorch** with **FP16** precision:
  ```python
  model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name, torch_dtype=torch.float16).to("cuda")
  ```

### **Cost Considerations**
Since youâ€™re running these models **locally**, there are no recurring API costs like those with OpenAI. The main costs are related to:
- **Hardware**: Your current setup with 32GB RAM and 12GB VRAM is sufficient for most 6B-13B models with optimizations like quantization.
- **Electricity**: Running large models for long durations can increase power consumption, but this is a relatively small cost compared to cloud-based services.

---

### **Summary**

1. **LLM Choice**: For categorizing markdown files and identifying technical setup guides, **GPT-J (6B)**, **LLaMA (7B or 13B)**, or **BLOOM (7B)** are all viable local models that balance performance and memory usage.
   
2. **Deployment**: These models can be deployed using the Hugging Face Transformers library, with optimizations like **quantization** and **FP16** to ensure they fit in your hardware constraints.

3. **Cost**: Since the models are open-source and run locally, there are no external costs aside from the one-time setup and hardware utilization.

By following these steps, you should be able to categorize and process your Obsidian markdown vault effectively! Let me know if you need more specific instructions on setting up your environment or running the LLM.
