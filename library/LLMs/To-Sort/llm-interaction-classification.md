*Note: this repository consists of the outputs of large language models (LLMs). In many cases, these are unedited or minimally edited. The information provided is for demonstrative purposes only and is intended to highlight constraints and capabilities in LLM applications and prompt engineering strategies.*


# Prompt

Let's come up with a 20 part taxonomy for classifying typical LLM interactions. Let's divide them according to whether they come from the user or the LLM. Create 10 for each.

# Output 

Here's a 20-part taxonomy for classifying typical LLM (Large Language Model) interactions, divided into user-driven and LLM-driven components:

### **User-Driven Interactions**

1. **Prompt**:
   - The initial query or instruction given by the user to the LLM.

2. **Clarification Request**:
   - When the user asks for more detailed information or clarification on a previous response.

3. **Follow-up Question**:
   - A related question that builds on the LLM’s previous response.

4. **Feedback**:
   - Explicit feedback from the user, such as agreeing, disagreeing, or providing corrections.

5. **Contextual Information**:
   - Additional background or context provided by the user to guide the LLM’s response.

6. **Task Instruction**:
   - A command or directive given by the user, such as "Translate this" or "Summarize the text."

7. **Preference Indication**:
   - The user specifies a preference, such as tone, format, or style for the response.

8. **Error Report**:
   - The user indicates that the LLM made an error, prompting correction or revision.

9. **Example Provision**:
   - The user provides an example to help the LLM understand the task or question better.

10. **Session Closure**:
    - The user indicates that the interaction is complete, signaling the end of the session.

### **LLM-Driven Interactions**

1. **Initial Response**:
   - The LLM’s first answer or output generated in response to the user’s prompt.

2. **Clarification Query**:
   - The LLM asks the user for more information to better understand the prompt.

3. **Contextual Continuation**:
   - The LLM maintains context across multiple turns in a conversation, continuing from previous responses.

4. **Suggestion**:
   - The LLM proposes ideas, alternative approaches, or additional information that might be relevant.

5. **Error Acknowledgment**:
   - The LLM recognizes a mistake in its response and offers a correction.

6. **Response Expansion**:
   - The LLM provides an elaborated or extended response, going beyond what was asked.

7. **Hypothetical Scenarios**:
   - The LLM generates hypothetical examples or scenarios to illustrate a point or answer a question.

8. **Assumption Making**:
   - The LLM makes assumptions based on incomplete information and provides a response accordingly.

9. **Tone Adaptation**:
   - The LLM adjusts the tone, style, or formality of its response based on the user’s input or preferences.

10. **Session Continuation**:
    - The LLM prompts the user to continue the conversation or explore related topics.

This taxonomy helps classify and analyze interactions, providing a structured way to understand the dynamics of communication between users and LLMs.## Extracted Prompts
