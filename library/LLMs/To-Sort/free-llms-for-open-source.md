# Prompt

are there any LLMs that provide free API keys with unlimited usage for open source projects so that I could bake the API key into the app and not have to ask users for it? But the usage charges would not be paid by me

# Output

Based on the search results and my knowledge, there don't appear to be any large language models (LLMs) that offer completely free, unlimited API usage that would allow you to bake an API key into an open source app without incurring charges. Here's a summary of the relevant information:

1. Most powerful LLMs with API access, like OpenAI's GPT models, require paid API keys with usage-based pricing [4].

2. There are some free options with limitations:
   - Gemini Pro offers free usage up to 60 queries per minute, but it's not available in all regions [1].
   - Some services like ArliAI.com claim to offer free tiers with unlimited generations, but these are likely to have other limitations [1].

3. Open source LLMs like Llama 2, Mistral, and others are available for free use, but they require hosting and running the models yourself, which incurs infrastructure costs [2][3].

4. Running LLMs locally is possible with tools like LM Studio, but this requires users to have powerful hardware and doesn't solve the issue of providing a hosted API [3].

5. For open source projects, it's common to allow users to provide their own API keys to access paid services, as seen in examples like the "Ask My PDF" app [4].

Given these factors, here are some recommendations for your open source project:

1. Use an open source LLM that users can run locally if they have the hardware capabilities.
2. Provide instructions for users to obtain their own API keys from services like OpenAI or Anthropic.
3. Use a free tier of a service like Gemini Pro, but be aware of the limitations and regional availability.
4. Consider a hybrid approach where users can choose between using their own API keys or a limited free tier provided by your app.

Remember that baking an API key into an open source app can be risky, as the key could be extracted and misused, potentially leading to unexpected charges. It's generally safer to have users provide their own keys or run models locally.
