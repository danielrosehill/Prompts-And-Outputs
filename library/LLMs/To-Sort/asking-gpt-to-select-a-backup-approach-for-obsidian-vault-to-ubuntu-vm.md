# Prompt

All sound like great options to me. Which do you think is the most robust (once we get it set up, it's going to run perfectly and not require maintenance?) Whatever option you think meets that criteria, give me a full guide for how to set it up on my Ubuntu VM

# Output

Here’s the updated guide that ensures a **remote-to-local-only** sync of your Obsidian vault, which means changes (including deletions) in the remote B2 bucket are reflected locally but not the other way around. Since your **B2 bucket is already up and running**, I’ve removed the bucket creation part.

### Updated Guide for Setting up Duplicacy on Ubuntu VM:

#### **Step 1: Install Duplicacy CLI**

1. **Download and Install Duplicacy**:
   - Run the following commands to install Duplicacy:
     ```bash
     sudo mkdir /usr/local/bin/duplicacy
     cd /usr/local/bin/duplicacy
     sudo wget https://github.com/gilbertchen/duplicacy/releases/download/v2.7.2/duplicacy_linux_x64_2.7.2
     sudo mv duplicacy_linux_x64_2.7.2 duplicacy
     sudo chmod +x duplicacy
     ```

2. **Verify Installation**:
   - To confirm that Duplicacy has been installed correctly, run:
     ```bash
     duplicacy
     ```

#### **Step 2: Initialize Duplicacy for Remote-to-Local Sync**

Since your bucket is already set up, we'll move forward with configuring Duplicacy for **remote-to-local backup** only.

1. **Set Up Backup Repository**:
   - Navigate to the directory where you want to store the backup (e.g., `/vaultreplica`):
     ```bash
     mkdir ~/vaultreplica
     cd ~/vaultreplica
     duplicacy init -e <backup-name> b2://<B2-account-id>@<bucket-name>
     ```
   - Replace `<backup-name>`, `<B2-account-id>`, and `<bucket-name>` with your actual backup name, B2 Account ID, and bucket name.
   - The `-e` option ensures that the backup is encrypted.

2. **Ensure Remote-to-Local-Only Backup**:
   - By default, Duplicacy will only pull data from the cloud without syncing changes back to the cloud. To confirm, ensure that no changes are pushed back to the remote by explicitly running the backup as a **pull-only operation**.
   - **Deletions from B2**: If a file is deleted in the B2 bucket, it will also be deleted locally to reflect the current state of the remote vault. This ensures the local copy mirrors the remote.

#### **Step 3: Configure the Backup Schedule**

1. **Nightly Incremental Sync**:
   - Create a bash script for automating nightly incremental backups:
     ```bash
     nano ~/duplicacy_backup.sh
     ```
   - Add the following content to automate the **remote-to-local sync**:
     ```bash
     #!/bin/bash
     cd ~/vaultreplica
     duplicacy pull -stats
     ```
   - The `pull` command ensures a one-way sync from remote (B2) to local.

   - Save and exit (`Ctrl + X`, then `Y`).

2. **Schedule the Script to Run Nightly**:
   - Use `cron` to schedule the backup to run at midnight:
     ```bash
     crontab -e
     ```
   - Add this line to run the backup every night at 00:00:
     ```bash
     0 0 * * * /bin/bash ~/duplicacy_backup.sh >> ~/duplicacy_backup.log 2>&1
     ```

#### **Step 4: Set Up Weekly Snapshots**

1. **Create a Weekly Snapshot Script**:
   - Open a new script for weekly snapshots:
     ```bash
     nano ~/duplicacy_weekly_snapshot.sh
     ```
   - Add the following script to create a weekly, timestamped archive:
     ```bash
     #!/bin/bash
     TIMESTAMP=$(date +%d%m%y)
     SNAPSHOT_DIR="~/snapshots/vault_$TIMESTAMP.tar.gz"
     cd ~/vaultreplica
     duplicacy pull -stats  # Ensures the latest state of the vault is pulled before creating the snapshot
     tar -czf $SNAPSHOT_DIR ~/vaultreplica
     ```

2. **Schedule the Weekly Snapshot**:
   - Use `cron` to schedule the snapshot to run every Sunday at 2:00 AM:
     ```bash
     crontab -e
     ```
   - Add this line to create the weekly snapshot every Sunday:
     ```bash
     0 2 * * 7 /bin/bash ~/duplicacy_weekly_snapshot.sh >> ~/duplicacy_snapshot.log 2>&1
     ```

#### **Step 5: Retain Only the Latest 5 Snapshots**

1. **Set up Retention Policy**:
   - Use a simple shell command to limit the number of snapshots:
   - Add the following line to your weekly snapshot script to ensure that only the last 5 snapshots are kept:
     ```bash
     find ~/snapshots -type f -name "*.tar.gz" | sort | head -n -5 | xargs rm -f
     ```

#### **Step 6: Test the Backup and Restore Process**

1. **Run the backup manually** to ensure it’s working as expected:
   ```bash
   ~/duplicacy_backup.sh
   ```

2. **Check logs**:
   - Check the output in the log files (`~/duplicacy_backup.log` and `~/duplicacy_snapshot.log`) to ensure everything is running smoothly.

3. **Test Restore**:
   - Test the restore process by running:
     ```bash
     duplicacy restore -r <revision-number>
     ```
   - Replace `<revision-number>` with the version you want to restore.

### **Summary of Changes**:
- **Remote-to-local-only sync**: We explicitly use the `duplicacy pull` command to ensure data is only pulled from B2 to local, and not the other way around.
- **Deletions sync**: This is automatically handled in Duplicacy; any file deleted in the remote vault will be removed locally, reflecting the current state of the B2 vault.

With these adjustments, your Duplicacy setup will ensure a robust remote-to-local backup process with automated snapshots and retention, without needing any manual intervention once configured.
