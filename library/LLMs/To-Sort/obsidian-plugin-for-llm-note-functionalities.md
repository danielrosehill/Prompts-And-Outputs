# Prompt
I think it probably makes more sense to work with existing tools. What do you think about the idea of building a plugin to make Obsidian more suitable for this purpose? There's already a B2 plugin. In my plugin, I'd like to recommend a specific folder structure and include the scripts that I'm developing. But I assume these would need to be runnable via a GUI rather than just provided as scripts. What do you think of this approach?

# Output
Building a plugin for Obsidian is a smart approach, especially since it already fits well within your existing workflow, and the community and plugin ecosystem around Obsidian are robust. Here’s why this approach could work well for your needs:

### **Advantages of Building an Obsidian Plugin**
1. **Familiarity and Integration**: Since you’re already using Obsidian, a plugin would seamlessly integrate into your current setup, allowing you to extend its functionality without needing to switch tools or deal with a steep learning curve.

2. **Community Support**: Obsidian has an active community, so you can draw on existing resources and support if you encounter challenges. There’s also a built-in plugin marketplace, making distribution easier if you choose to share your plugin with others.

3. **Flexibility**: By developing a plugin, you can tailor the tool to your exact needs, including:
   - **Recommended Folder Structure**: You can enforce or suggest a folder structure that organizes your prompts, outputs, and agent configurations efficiently.
   - **Scripts Integration**: Embedding your scripts into the plugin’s GUI allows you to run them directly within Obsidian, providing a more cohesive user experience.
   - **B2 Integration**: Since there’s already a B2 plugin, your plugin can complement it, perhaps automating certain tasks like syncing specific folders or running periodic backups.

### **Considerations for the Plugin Development**
1. **GUI for Running Scripts**: 
   - **Obsidian API**: Obsidian provides an API that you can use to create UI elements within the app. You can develop buttons, dropdowns, or even custom panels where users can interact with your scripts.
   - **User Experience**: Ensure that running scripts via the GUI is intuitive. Consider adding confirmation prompts or options to customize script behavior.

2. **Folder Structure Recommendations**:
   - **Default Setup**: Your plugin could automatically generate a recommended folder structure when installed or provide a one-click setup.
   - **Customizability**: While it’s good to have defaults, allowing users to customize the structure to fit their workflow could be beneficial.

3. **Modularity**:
   - **Script Modularity**: Ensure your scripts can be easily updated or swapped out, either through the plugin settings or via configuration files.
   - **Plugin Extensibility**: If your needs evolve, keeping the plugin’s code modular will make future updates and feature additions smoother.

### **Feasibility and Challenges**
- **Technical Challenge**: Obsidian plugins are built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, with the logic typically handled in JavaScript. If you're comfortable with these technologies, developing the plugin should be quite feasible.
- **Time Investment**: While starting with an existing tool like Obsidian reduces the overall complexity, building a well-functioning, polished plugin will still require a solid time investment, especially if you want to create a smooth GUI experience.

### **Conclusion**
Building a plugin for Obsidian is a practical and scalable solution. It allows you to leverage a powerful existing tool while customizing it to meet your specific needs. This approach should be more efficient and manageable than building a new app from scratch, especially if you prioritize usability and integration with your current workflow.## Extracted Prompts
