*Note: this repository consists of the outputs of large language models (LLMs). In many cases, these are unedited or minimally edited. The information provided is for demonstrative purposes only and is intended to highlight constraints and capabilities in LLM applications and prompt engineering strategies.*


You asked about any large language models (LLMs) that aren't rate-limited.

While nearly all commercially available LLMs (including OpenAI's GPT models) have some form of rate limiting due to infrastructure costs and demand management, there are some alternatives that offer more flexibility, particularly in the open-source community or models you can self-host, which don’t have the same type of rate limits imposed by a third party.

Open-source LLMs you can self-host (No rate limits):

By self-hosting, you can run the model locally or on your own server/cloud infrastructure, and the only limits would be your hardware's capabilities.

1. LLaMA (by Meta):

Description: LLaMA (Large Language Model Meta AI) is a family of models ranging from smaller to larger ones, designed to be efficient and powerful for a range of tasks. It's not quite as powerful as GPT-4, but it is a solid alternative that can be fine-tuned.

Availability: You need to apply for access to use LLaMA models, but they can be run without rate limits once set up on your infrastructure.



2. GPT-NeoX (by EleutherAI):

Description: GPT-NeoX-20B is one of the most powerful open-source models available and is somewhat comparable to GPT-3 in capability. It’s available for self-hosting, and since it's open-source, there are no inherent rate limits.

Availability: Hosted on platforms like Hugging Face, but you can also run it on your own hardware or in the cloud.



3. GPT-J (by EleutherAI):

Description: GPT-J is a smaller model than GPT-3, but still effective for many language tasks. It’s a solid option for developers looking to integrate an LLM without rate restrictions by self-hosting.

Availability: Like NeoX, you can self-host it on your own infrastructure or use services like Hugging Face.



4. Mistral:

Description: Mistral is a newer open-source language model that boasts competitive performance for its size. It’s optimized for efficient, high-quality performance and is available without the kind of rate limits imposed by commercial APIs when self-hosted.

Availability: Open-source and accessible for self-hosting.



5. Bloom:

Description: Bloom is a multilingual LLM with capabilities comparable to GPT-3, developed collaboratively by researchers. It's also open-source, meaning you can run it without rate limits on your infrastructure.

Availability: Available on Hugging Face or for self-hosting.



6. Alpaca/LLaMA derivatives:

Description: Alpaca is based on Meta's LLaMA models but fine-tuned for instruction-following tasks, making it similar in function to OpenAI's models like ChatGPT. If you host it yourself, there are no rate limits.

Availability: Available for download and self-hosting.




Cloud providers with generous limits (but not fully unlimited):

Some cloud providers offer access to LLMs without strict rate limits, though they may still have usage caps based on pricing tiers:

1. Hugging Face:

While they do impose rate limits on hosted models, if you use Hugging Face's inference API with a subscription plan or host your models on their hardware, you may get more flexibility in how much you can use them.



2. Cohere:

Cohere offers language models with flexible pricing, but they do impose rate limits, especially on free or lower-tier plans. However, their custom plans may be more generous for higher usage needs.




Considerations for Self-hosting:

Infrastructure costs: If you self-host an open-source LLM, the rate limits are effectively eliminated, but you need to ensure you have the hardware to support it. Running large models requires significant CPU/GPU resources, RAM, and storage.

Cloud computing: For scalable usage without rate limits, you can rent servers from cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure) to host models, but this comes with operational costs and setup complexity.


By self-hosting an open-source LLM, you eliminate the external rate limits imposed by a service provider and only need to manage your server capacity or cloud infrastructure costs.
