Yes, there are some chat interfaces that can be used with multiple large language models (LLMs) without needing individual integrations for each one. These interfaces are typically designed to be model-agnostic, allowing you to connect to various LLMs by specifying the API endpoints or using certain frameworks that facilitate such flexibility. Here are some options:

1. LangChain

Overview: LangChain is a framework designed for developing applications powered by language models. It is LLM-agnostic, meaning it can interface with multiple models (like OpenAI's GPT, Hugging Face models, and more) without needing individual integrations for each.

Features: LangChain provides tools for chaining prompts, memory management, and interacting with external APIs, making it flexible for a wide range of use cases.

Use Case: You can connect LangChain to various LLMs simply by configuring the correct API keys or endpoints.


2. Gradio

Overview: Gradio is an open-source Python library that allows you to quickly create user interfaces for machine learning models, including LLMs. It is flexible and can be connected to multiple models via APIs, enabling interaction with any LLM that provides API access.

Features: It allows users to build a chat interface or other interactive components (e.g., text inputs) without being tied to a single model.

Use Case: You can create chat UIs that connect to OpenAI models, Hugging Face models, or any custom API with minimal setup.


3. Haystack by deepset

Overview: Haystack is an open-source framework for building NLP systems that work with multiple LLMs. It's designed for flexibility, allowing you to switch between different LLMs for inference, question-answering, and chat interfaces.

Features: Haystack supports backends like OpenAI GPT, Hugging Face Transformers, and even custom models hosted on your own infrastructure.

Use Case: It’s useful for developers who want to create multi-LLM workflows, especially for tasks like Q&A, conversational agents, or document retrieval.


4. OpenAI-Compatible Clients

Overview: Some chat interfaces or tools that are compatible with OpenAI's API can also work with other models that adhere to OpenAI's API specifications. This includes certain wrappers and clients like OpenAI Python SDK or openai-cookbook, which can sometimes be configured to interact with other models that follow similar API designs.

Features: These clients enable users to switch between OpenAI models and other models by changing the base URL or API keys.


5. Rasa

Overview: Rasa is an open-source conversational AI framework that allows you to integrate any machine learning model into its pipeline, including LLMs. While Rasa is primarily focused on building task-oriented chatbots, it can interface with a variety of language models for natural language understanding and generation.

Use Case: You can use Rasa as a front-end chat interface while connecting it to different LLM backends for response generation, depending on the task.


6. Hugging Face Spaces and Inference API

Overview: Hugging Face Spaces offers a platform to create interactive demos, including chat interfaces, for any model hosted on Hugging Face. The Hugging Face Inference API also allows for easy integration with multiple models through a common API.

Use Case: Developers can create UIs that interact with any model available on Hugging Face’s Model Hub by simply calling the appropriate API endpoint.


In these cases, the key to making the chat interface LLM-agnostic is leveraging frameworks that support multiple LLMs out of the box or designing the chat interface to be API-driven, where switching LLMs is just a matter of changing the API endpoint or model parameters.
