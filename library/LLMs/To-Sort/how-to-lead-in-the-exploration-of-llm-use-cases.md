*Note: this repository consists of the outputs of large language models (LLMs). In many cases, these are unedited or minimally edited. The information provided is for demonstrative purposes only and is intended to highlight constraints and capabilities in LLM applications and prompt engineering strategies.*


If you're more interested in exploring use cases for LLMs, focusing on practical applications and emerging possibilities, you can channel your enthusiasm in the following ways:

1. Experimenting with LLMs: Dive into existing tools like ChatGPT, Codex, or other open models to see how they can be applied in new areas. Experiment with integrating these models into workflows, automating tasks, and enhancing creativity. Use your technical setup (such as Obsidian or Linux) to create integrations and test new ideas.


2. Collaborating on Projects: Join or initiate projects that leverage LLMs in innovative ways. Look into platforms like GitHub where developers share open-source AI projects. You can contribute or create your own projects, showcasing how LLMs can improve productivity, education, or communication.


3. Exploring Industry-Specific Use Cases: Investigate how LLMs can be applied in industries you're familiar with or passionate about. For example, you could focus on communications, content creation, or even helping non-profits become more efficient through AI-driven solutions.


4. Sharing Discoveries: As you explore new applications, document and share your findings, either through blog posts, tutorials, or social media. This helps you engage with others who share your passion and can inspire others to explore LLMs in new contexts.


5. Start an LLM Community: If you don’t see a community specifically focused on LLM use cases, you could start one. Whether it’s a forum, a newsletter, or even just regular meetups, creating a space for enthusiasts to discuss and share their discoveries can be a powerful way to influence the field.


6. Consulting or Advising: With your enthusiasm and growing expertise, you could become an advocate for LLM integration within businesses or organizations. Helping others understand how they can apply LLMs to their unique challenges would position you as a thought leader in this space.

Focusing on discovering new LLM use cases can put you at the forefront of AI's practical applications and make you a key contributor to the AI movement.
