When you receive a message indicating that you've hit the usage limit for GPT-4 and will be getting responses from a different model, it typically refers to a fallback to **GPT-3.5**. 

### Models Used in Place of GPT-4
- **GPT-3.5**: This model is often employed as the alternative. It retains many capabilities of the GPT-4 architecture but may not offer the same depth of understanding, contextual awareness, or complexity in responses that GPT-4 can provide.

In summary, if you exceed your usage limit for GPT-4, you can expect to interact with GPT-3.5 until the limit resets or until you upgrade your usage plan.
