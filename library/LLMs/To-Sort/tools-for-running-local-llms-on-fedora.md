*Note: this repository consists of the outputs of large language models (LLMs). In many cases, these are unedited or minimally edited. The information provided is for demonstrative purposes only and is intended to highlight constraints and capabilities in LLM applications and prompt engineering strategies.*


# Input

Could you provide a list of all the tools like Ollama and LLM Studio that I can use on Fedora to run local LLMs please? Are there others?

# Output

Here is a list of tools you can use on Fedora to run local large language models (LLMs) like StarCoder:

## GUI-Based Tools

1. **LM Studio**: A cross-platform GUI available on Linux, Mac, and Windows. It supports multiple models, including StarCoder, and provides an easy-to-use interface for interacting with LLMs. It also allows setting up a local HTTP server for AI applications[5][6].

2. **GPT4All**: Offers both terminal and GUI versions to run local models. It supports various models and provides privacy-first, offline capabilities[5][6].

3. **Jan**: Known for its speed and efficiency, Jan is a local LLM application that runs entirely offline on Linux, among other platforms[3].

## Command-Line Tools

1. **Ollama**: A simple CLI tool that allows you to run LLMs on Linux. It supports creating and sharing models with a portable Modelfile package[2][3].

2. **llama.cpp**: A C/C++ library that provides fast inference for LLMs on Linux and other platforms. It supports various models beyond the Llama family[2][3].

3. **llm**: A CLI tool and Python library for interacting with LLMs. It can be extended with plugins like llm-gpt4all to run local models[2][4].

4. **localllm**: Developed by Google Cloud, this tool can be used locally or in the cloud, providing flexibility in deployment[2].

## Additional Options

- **Llamafile**: Converts LLMs into executable files that can run on Linux without installation, offering a straightforward way to integrate AI into applications[6].
- **Chat With RTX by NVIDIA**: Utilizes Tensor Cores to run LLMs locally with a focus on speed and efficiency[5].
- **ExLLaMAv2 and vllm**: Other tools mentioned for running local LLMs, though specific details were not provided in the search results[2].

# Input

Nice. I'm looking for GUIs specifically. Any more?

# Output


Here are some GUI-based tools you can use on Fedora to run local large language models (LLMs) like StarCoder:

## GUI-Based Tools for Running LLMs Locally

1. **LM Studio**: This tool provides a clean and intuitive interface for running LLMs. It supports various models and offers features like a multi-turn chat format, local inference server setup, and compatibility checks for your machine's specifications[6].

2. **GPT4All**: Offers a desktop client with a user-friendly GUI for interacting with LLMs. It allows you to upload documents and ask questions about them, providing a straightforward way to chat with models locally[4].

3. **Jan**: Known for its fast response generation, Jan provides a simple and natural interface similar to ChatGPT. It allows for local API server setup and supports extensions for additional functionalities[4].

4. **LobeChat**: An open-source WebUI framework that supports major language models globally. It offers a rich user interface and can be integrated with Ollama and other local models[2].

5. **Open WebUI**: A self-hosted AI interface designed to run offline, supporting various LLM runners, including Ollama. It focuses on providing a feature-rich and user-friendly experience[2].

6. **Chatbox**: A cross-platform open-source client application developed with Tauri, supporting several popular large models through APIs[2].

7. **NextJS Ollama LLM UI**: A minimalist user interface designed specifically for Ollama, offering a clean aesthetic for users who prefer simplicity[2].

These tools provide various interfaces and functionalities to suit different preferences for running LLMs locally on Fedora. Depending on your specific needs, such as ease of use or additional features like document integration, you can choose the tool that best fits your workflow.
