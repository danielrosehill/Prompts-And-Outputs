*Note: this repository consists of the outputs of large language models (LLMs). In many cases, these are unedited or minimally edited. The information provided is for demonstrative purposes only and is intended to highlight constraints and capabilities in LLM applications and prompt engineering strategies.*


# Prompt

Great. We covered tokenisation and temperature. Can you think about some other technical facets of LLMs that might be hard for laypeople to understand. Give me  a list of as many as you can think of (ordered alphabetically)

# Output

Here's an alphabetically ordered list of technical facets of LLMs that might be challenging for laypeople to understand:

1. Attention mechanisms
2. Beam search
3. Bidirectional encoding
4. Computational complexity
5. Context window
6. Decoder-only vs. encoder-decoder architectures
7. Embedding spaces
8. Emergent abilities
9. Few-shot and zero-shot learning
10. Fine-tuning vs. pre-training
11. Gradient descent and backpropagation
12. Hallucinations
13. Hyperparameter optimization
14. In-context learning
15. Inference optimization techniques
16. Layer normalization
17. Loss functions
18. Model compression techniques
19. Multi-head attention
20. Neural architecture search
21. Parallel processing and distributed training
22. Perplexity
23. Positional encoding
24. Prompt engineering
25. Quantization
26. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
27. Scaling laws
28. Self-attention
29. Sequence-to-sequence learning
30. Softmax function
31. Sparse attention
32. Tokenization (subword, byte-pair encoding, etc.)
33. Transfer learning
34. Transformer architecture
35. Unsupervised pre-training

These concepts represent various aspects of LLM design, training, and operation that can be complex for non-experts to grasp fully.
