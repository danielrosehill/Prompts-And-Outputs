# Prompt

As you know, I'm very interested in exploring prompt engineering and LLM usage. For the latter, my main interest is in understanding how it can help analyse data for better policymaking and to assist with research. My job involves working with a thought leader in the field of impact investing and this is certainly an area where LLMs could be useful. Can you think of any online communities or networking groups or fora where those who are exploring evolving LLM applications in business and the non profit world can find one another and communicate?

# Output

Based on your interests in exploring LLM applications for data analysis, policymaking, research, and impact investing, here are some online communities and networking groups you might find valuable:

**<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">1. AI for Good Foundation: They have a community focused on using AI, including LLMs, for social impact and sustainable development. They often discuss applications in policy and research.</mark>**

2. Data Science for Social Good Network: This community connects data scientists working on social impact projects, including those using LLMs for analysis and research.

3. Impact Investing Forum on LinkedIn: While not exclusively focused on LLMs, this group discusses innovative technologies in impact investing, which could include LLM applications.

4. Hugging Face Community: Hugging Face is a platform for sharing and collaborating on machine learning models, including LLMs. They have an active community discussing various applications.

5. AI Ethics Discussion Group: This group often covers responsible AI use in policymaking and research, which aligns with your interests.

6. OpenAI Community Forum: OpenAI, the creators of GPT models, has a community forum where developers and researchers discuss LLM applications.

7. AI for Social Good on Meetup: Many local Meetup groups focus on AI applications for social good, which could be relevant to your work in impact investing.

8. ResearchGate AI in Policy Group: This academic network has groups discussing AI applications in policy research.

9. The AI Forum New Zealand: As mentioned in the search results, they have a working group on Large Language Models that could be relevant to your interests.

10. Data Science Dojo Community: They offer resources and community discussions on AI applications, including in non-profit sectors.

These communities can provide opportunities to network, share ideas, and stay updated on evolving LLM applications in business and non-profit sectors. Remember to actively participate and contribute to these communities to get the most value from them.
