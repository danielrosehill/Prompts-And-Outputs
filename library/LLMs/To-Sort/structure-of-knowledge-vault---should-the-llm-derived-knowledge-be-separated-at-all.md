*Note: this repository consists of the outputs of large language models (LLMs). In many cases, these are unedited or minimally edited. The information provided is for demonstrative purposes only and is intended to highlight constraints and capabilities in LLM applications and prompt engineering strategies.*


# Prompt

Here are the various things that I've committed into my Obsidian Vault to date. Remember that I set it up just to store LLM outputs!

- Outlines of blogs
- Finished blogs
- Health tests
- Project outlines
- progress notes for things I'm working on 
- Plans for employment 
- GPT outputs I've saved for my job 
- Lots of (GPT) prompts
- Lots of (GPT) outputs

I've found Obsidian fantastic but clearly this fast growing repository could use some structure. 

I'm undecided between whether it makes sense to distinguish rigidly between LLM-created content (like the outputs). Or whether it would be better to transition to a knowledge repository that integrates the LLM artifacts seamlessly throughout the system.

What do you think? Suggest how either could be structured from a file perspective

# Output

Given your vault’s growth, organizing it with a clear, adaptable structure will make it easier to retrieve, review, and build on your stored knowledge. Here’s a look at both approaches you’re considering, along with possible folder structures.

### 1. **Separate Structure for LLM-Generated Content**
   - **Pros**: This method clearly distinguishes LLM-generated material from your personal insights, making it easy to focus on just LLM content when needed.
   - **Cons**: Fragmenting might lead to duplicated information if, for example, a GPT output is foundational for your project notes. It could also be harder to see connections between AI content and your insights.
   - **Suggested Folder Structure**:
     ```
     /LLM-Generated/
         /GPT Outputs/
             - Job Outputs/
             - General Knowledge Outputs/
             - Prompts/
         /Blog Outlines/
         /Finished Blogs/
     
     /Personal/
         /Health/
             - Tests/
             - Other Notes/
         /Projects/
             - Active Projects/
             - Archived Projects/
         /Plans/
             - Employment Plans/
             - Future Projects/
         /Progress/
     ```

   - **Notes**: In this structure, keep “LLM-Generated” separate, but consider including inter-folder links between related content. This allows LLM outputs to enrich personal projects while maintaining separation for easier navigation.

### 2. **Integrated Knowledge Repository**
   - **Pros**: Seamless integration creates a single system where LLM content supports and enriches your personal notes. This makes related information easy to view in context, which can improve continuity and reduce redundancies.
   - **Cons**: Finding purely LLM-generated content might be trickier if needed separately for reference or analysis, though you could tag them.
   - **Suggested Folder Structure**:
     ```
     /Knowledge Base/
         /Blogs/
             - Outlines/
             - Finished/
         /Health/
             - Tests/
             - Resources/
         /Projects/
             - Active Projects/
             - Archived Projects/
             - Project Outlines/
         /Career/
             - Employment Plans/
             - GPT Job Outputs/
         /LLM Content/
             - General Knowledge Outputs/
             - Prompts/
             - Saved GPT Outputs/
     ```

   - **Notes**: Here, LLM outputs are linked throughout the repository and tagged, for example, with “#LLM” or “#GPT” to filter LLM content quickly. Use inter-file links within projects to include relevant LLM-generated outputs as supporting material.

### Additional Structuring Tips
- **Tags**: Tag LLM content with consistent labels like “#LLM-output” or “#Prompt” so you can search for and isolate this content as needed.
- **Index Files**: Create an “Index” note in each major folder (e.g., “Projects”) listing key resources and any linked LLM outputs for quick access.
- **Templates**: Use templates for common documents (project outlines, blog posts, etc.) to maintain consistency in formatting and metadata, helping you stay organized regardless of approach.

If frequent cross-referencing between LLM outputs and personal content is important, the integrated approach may ultimately serve you better. But if you foresee needing quick access to purely LLM material, separating content could be more useful. Either way, tags and a solid indexing system can enhance navigation and ensure valuable insights aren’t buried in the growing vault.
