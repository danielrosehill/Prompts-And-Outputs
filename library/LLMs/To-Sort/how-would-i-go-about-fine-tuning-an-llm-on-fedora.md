# Prompt

LLM fine tuning is interesting. But I'd be interested in exploring it from more of a foundational baseline. As you know I'm using Fedora. Let's say that I wanted to fine tune a GPT as you suggested. I can certainly feed it thousands of outputs. The question is: how would I devise and implement the fine tuning experiment? Are there specific tools for this?

# Output

To fine-tune a GPT model from a foundational baseline on your Fedora system, you'll need to explore the following steps and tools to set up the experiment and perform the fine-tuning. Here’s a guide to help you devise and implement the fine-tuning process:

### 1. **Set Up Your Environment**

Since you're using Fedora, you'll need a development environment that supports the tools necessary for training and fine-tuning GPT models. The following packages are essential:

- **Python** (Make sure it's installed):
  ```bash
  sudo dnf install python3
  ```

- **Pip** (Install the required libraries):
  ```bash
  sudo dnf install python3-pip
  ```

- **PyTorch or TensorFlow**: Both frameworks are widely used for training/fine-tuning models. I recommend starting with PyTorch for its ease of use:
  ```bash
  pip install torch
  ```

- **Hugging Face Transformers Library**: This is the most widely used framework for training, fine-tuning, and using large language models. Install it using pip:
  ```bash
  pip install transformers
  ```

### 2. **Prepare Your Dataset**

You’ll need a properly formatted dataset for fine-tuning. If you're classifying outputs (e.g., product recommendations, summaries), your dataset should include:
   - **Input** (text generated by GPT)
   - **Labels** (metadata such as output type: "Product recommendation," "Summary," etc.)

A typical fine-tuning dataset will be in **JSON** or **CSV** format, with each entry containing the text and corresponding label. An example in JSON might look like this:

```json
[
  {"text": "This is a product recommendation for laptops.", "label": "Product recommendation"},
  {"text": "This is a summary of a research paper.", "label": "Summary"}
]
```

### 3. **Fine-Tuning GPT Using Hugging Face**

Once your dataset is ready, you can start the fine-tuning process. Hugging Face makes it relatively easy to fine-tune models like GPT-2, GPT-3, or any Transformer-based model.

Here are the key steps:

#### Step 1: Load a Pretrained Model
```python
from transformers import GPT2Tokenizer, GPT2ForSequenceClassification, Trainer, TrainingArguments

# Load the tokenizer and the model
tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained('gpt2')
model = GPT2ForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('gpt2', num_labels=2)  # Adjust num_labels based on your taxonomy
```

#### Step 2: Preprocess the Dataset
Tokenize the dataset using the GPT tokenizer so the model can interpret the data:

```python
def preprocess_function(examples):
    return tokenizer(examples['text'], truncation=True, padding='max_length')

# Assuming you've already loaded your dataset using a library like Pandas or datasets
tokenized_datasets = dataset.map(preprocess_function, batched=True)
```

#### Step 3: Set Training Arguments
Define the parameters for fine-tuning:

```python
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir="./results",
    evaluation_strategy="epoch",
    learning_rate=2e-5,
    per_device_train_batch_size=8,
    per_device_eval_batch_size=8,
    num_train_epochs=3,
    weight_decay=0.01
)
```

#### Step 4: Train the Model
Use Hugging Face’s `Trainer` class to train the model:

```python
trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=tokenized_datasets["train"],
    eval_dataset=tokenized_datasets["test"],
)

trainer.train()
```

#### Step 5: Evaluate the Model
Once trained, evaluate its performance:

```python
eval_results = trainer.evaluate()
print(f"Evaluation results: {eval_results}")
```

### 4. **Experiment Tracking**
If you want to track your experiments and compare different runs, you can use tools like **MLflow** or **Weights & Biases**. They allow you to track hyperparameters, training time, and performance metrics.

To install Weights & Biases:
```bash
pip install wandb
```

### 5. **Scaling Up Fine-Tuning**
You might want to scale up your experiments as your dataset grows or if you want to improve the model further:
   - **Cloud Compute**: If you're working with a large dataset or a model, consider using cloud services with GPUs (AWS, GCP, or Hugging Face's Accelerate).
   - **Hugging Face Accelerate**: This tool helps distribute training across multiple GPUs, optimizing the process on limited hardware.

### Tools Summary:
- **PyTorch or TensorFlow** for model training.
- **Hugging Face Transformers** for loading and fine-tuning LLMs.
- **Weights & Biases** or **MLflow** for tracking experiments.
- **Hugging Face Datasets** for handling large datasets during fine-tuning.

With these tools, you can devise and implement fine-tuning experiments on your Fedora system, giving you control over how your GPT model assigns metadata or handles specific tasks.
