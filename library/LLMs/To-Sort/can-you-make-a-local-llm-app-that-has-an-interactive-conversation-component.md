# Prompt

Could you help me to create a GUI which I will use to generate software specs with. I'd like to create a simple Python GUI which I can use on Fedora Linux. The GUI would allow me to have a conversation with ChatGPT (via the API) designed to help me generate a software spec. I would like the interaction to be fixed in the sense that I can define some questions GPT must ask me. Is it possible to create an interactive GPT app that can run locally via the API in the mannner I'm describing? So far I've only done local GPT apps that ask for one prompt and then give an output. Is there a term for this more interactive model?

# Output

Yes, it's possible to create a **conversational Python GUI** that interacts with GPT via the API to guide you through generating a software specification by asking pre-defined and dynamic questions. The concept you're describing falls under what's often referred to as a **conversational agent** or **interactive chatbot**.

### Key Features of the GUI:
- The GUI will allow for a **multi-turn conversation** with GPT, where you can define a fixed set of questions that GPT must ask, followed by dynamic interactions based on your responses.
- The app will run locally on **Fedora Linux** and interact with the GPT API.
- The app will keep track of your answers and display them as you build out the software requirements.

### Step-by-Step Guide to Building the Interactive GPT App:

#### 1. **Prerequisites**
   - **Python**: Make sure Python 3 is installed on Fedora.
   - **ChatGPT API**: You need an API key from OpenAI to use the GPT API.
   - **Tkinter**: A simple GUI toolkit built into Python for cross-platform interfaces.

#### 2. **Python Libraries to Install**
You’ll need to install a few Python libraries for the project:
```bash
pip install openai
pip install tkinter
```

#### 3. **Basic Structure of the App**
Here’s a high-level description of how the app will work:
- **Fixed Questions**: You can define a list of fixed questions that GPT must ask.
- **API Interaction**: The app will send your responses to GPT via the API, along with the next question.
- **Dynamic Conversation**: GPT can continue asking follow-up questions based on your responses, with the conversation tracked in the GUI.

#### 4. **Python Code Example**
Here’s a basic Python script that uses **Tkinter** for the GUI and **OpenAI's GPT API** for the conversational interaction. It starts with pre-defined questions and allows interaction through the GUI.

```python
import openai
import tkinter as tk

# Initialize OpenAI API
openai.api_key = 'your-api-key-here'

# List of fixed questions to ask
fixed_questions = [
    "What is the purpose of the software?",
    "Who are the target users?",
    "What are the main features required?",
    "Are there any specific platform requirements (e.g., Linux, Android)?",
    "Do you have any performance or security requirements?"
]

# Initialize global variables
question_index = 0
conversation_history = ""

def ask_gpt(prompt):
    """ Send the prompt to GPT API and return the response. """
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-003",
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=150,
        temperature=0.5
    )
    return response.choices[0].text.strip()

def on_send():
    """ Handle user input and send it to GPT """
    global question_index, conversation_history

    # Get user input
    user_input = user_entry.get()

    # Clear user input field
    user_entry.delete(0, tk.END)

    # Add user input to conversation history
    conversation_history += f"You: {user_input}\n"

    # If there are fixed questions left, ask the next one
    if question_index < len(fixed_questions):
        next_question = fixed_questions[question_index]
        question_index += 1
    else:
        # If no fixed questions are left, continue the conversation dynamically
        next_question = ask_gpt(conversation_history)

    # Update conversation history with GPT's response
    conversation_history += f"GPT: {next_question}\n"

    # Update conversation in the GUI
    conversation_label.config(text=conversation_history)

def start_conversation():
    """ Start the conversation with the first question """
    global conversation_history, question_index
    if question_index == 0:
        first_question = fixed_questions[question_index]
        conversation_history += f"GPT: {first_question}\n"
        conversation_label.config(text=conversation_history)
        question_index += 1

# Initialize the Tkinter GUI
root = tk.Tk()
root.title("Software Spec Generator")
root.geometry("600x400")

# Conversation display area
conversation_label = tk.Label(root, text="", justify=tk.LEFT, anchor="nw", wraplength=580)
conversation_label.pack(padx=10, pady=10, fill="both", expand=True)

# Entry widget for user input
user_entry = tk.Entry(root, width=80)
user_entry.pack(pady=10)

# Send button
send_button = tk.Button(root, text="Send", command=on_send)
send_button.pack()

# Start the conversation with the first question
start_conversation()

# Run the GUI main loop
root.mainloop()
```

### Features of This Script:
1. **Predefined Questions**: It starts with a fixed list of questions about your software spec (defined in the `fixed_questions` list).
2. **Dynamic GPT Responses**: After the predefined questions are done, GPT dynamically generates follow-up questions based on your responses.
3. **GUI Interaction**: You can interact with GPT directly in the GUI, with the conversation being displayed and updated after each input.
4. **Conversation History**: The conversation is tracked in the GUI so you can see your responses and GPT’s questions in one continuous flow.

#### 5. **How to Use the Script**
1. Replace `'your-api-key-here'` with your actual **OpenAI API key**.
2. Run the Python script on your **Fedora Linux** system. It will open a simple GUI where you can start interacting with GPT.
3. You can answer GPT’s questions, and the conversation will dynamically unfold based on both your input and predefined questions.

### Next Steps for Improvement:
- **Save Conversation**: Add a feature to export the conversation to a Markdown or text file directly from the GUI to save your software spec.
- **Add Flexibility**: You can modify the questions or dynamically adjust the conversation flow based on specific conditions or user input.
- **Advanced UI**: You could improve the UI with buttons for saving, loading previous specs, or even categorizing different software specs.

### Conclusion:
The **term** you're looking for here is **conversational agent** or **interactive chatbot** with **multi-turn dialogue**. The Python app outlined above lets you run a local, interactive conversation using GPT via its API and a GUI on **Fedora Linux**. This should provide a good starting point for generating software specs dynamically.
