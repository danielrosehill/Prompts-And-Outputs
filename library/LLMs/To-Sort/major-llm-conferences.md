*Note: this repository consists of the outputs of large language models (LLMs). In many cases, these are unedited or minimally edited. The information provided is for demonstrative purposes only and is intended to highlight constraints and capabilities in LLM applications and prompt engineering strategies.*


# Prompt

Let's talk about major conferences that have a strong focus on LLMs. Can you give me a list of the major ones that are out there currently? Give me both a top list and a list of conferences in Europe

# Output

Based on the search results and current trends in AI, here's a list of major conferences with a strong focus on Large Language Models (LLMs):

Top LLM-focused Conferences Globally:

1. NeurIPS (Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems)
   - One of the most prestigious AI conferences, often featuring cutting-edge LLM research
   - 2024 location and date TBA

2. ICML (International Conference on Machine Learning)
   - Vienna, Austria, July 21–27, 2024
   - Consistently features important LLM papers and workshops

3. AAAI Conference (Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence)
   - Vancouver, Canada, February 20–27, 2024

4. ACL (Association for Computational Linguistics)
   - Bangkok, Thailand, August 11-16, 2024
   - Focuses heavily on NLP and language models

5. SIGIR LLM Day (as part of SIGIR 2024)
   - Washington D.C., USA, July 16, 2024
   - Dedicated day focusing on LLMs in information retrieval

6. Efficient Generative AI Summit
   - San Jose, California, September 9-12, 2024

7. The AI Conference 2024
   - San Francisco, California, September 10-11, 2024

Major LLM-focused Conferences in Europe:

1. ICLR (International Conference on Learning Representations)
   - Vienna, Austria, May 7–11, 2024
   - Often features important papers on LLM architectures and training

2. ICML (International Conference on Machine Learning)
   - Vienna, Austria, July 21–27, 2024
   - While global, it's being held in Europe in 2024

3. EMNLP (Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing)
   - Usually held in Europe every other year, 2024 location TBA

4. EACL (European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics)
   - Biennial conference, next one likely in 2025

5. AI Summit London
   - London, UK, dates for 2024 TBA
   - While not exclusively focused on LLMs, it often features LLM applications in industry

6. World Summit AI
   - Amsterdam, Netherlands, dates for 2024 TBA
   - Broad AI focus but often includes significant LLM content

It's worth noting that while these conferences have historically been important venues for LLM research and discussions, the field is rapidly evolving. Many conferences are adapting their focus to include more LLM-related content, and new specialized events may emerge. Additionally, some conferences that traditionally weren't focused on LLMs are now incorporating more LLM-related tracks and workshops due to the growing importance of this technology.

For the most up-to-date information, it's advisable to check the official websites of these conferences as the dates approach, as schedules and focus areas may be adjusted to reflect the latest trends in AI and LLM research.
