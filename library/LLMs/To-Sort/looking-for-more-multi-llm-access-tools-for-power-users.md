*Note: this repository consists of the outputs of large language models (LLMs). In many cases, these are unedited or minimally edited. The information provided is for demonstrative purposes only and is intended to highlight constraints and capabilities in LLM applications and prompt engineering strategies.*


# Prompt

I've come across a few interesting tools which allow you to use multiple LLMs for conversational interactions: Typing Mind, Chat Playground, and Poe. I wasn't a huge fan of Perplexity. I'm a "power user" who runs a large volume of prompts daily. I would like to find whichever tool has the highest rate limits and the widest choice of models. Please list as many options as you're aware of

# Output

For power users looking for high rate limits and a wide selection of models, here's a comparison of several tools that allow interaction with multiple LLMs:

## TypingMind

TypingMind stands out as a strong contender for power users:

- **Model Selection**: Offers access to over 35 pre-configured models, including OpenAI GPT models, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini, Meta's Llama models, and more[7].
- **Customization**: Allows integration of custom models with OpenAI-compatible API endpoints[7].
- **Rate Limits**: While specific rate limits aren't mentioned, TypingMind provides flexible usage management:
  - Customizable limits for messages, characters per message, and characters per time period[6].
  - Ability to set different limits for various user groups or individual users[6].
- **API Integration**: Users can use their own API keys for services like OpenAI or Anthropic[7].

## Chat Playground

Chat Playground offers a local solution with some unique features:

- **Privacy**: Stores messages as JSON files locally, allowing easy syncing with cloud services[4].
- **Flexibility**: Enables editing of messages within a thread without deleting subsequent messages[4].
- **Model Options**: While specific model options aren't detailed, it supports changing model settings and types (e.g., GPT-3.5/4)[4].
- **Rate Limits**: As a local tool, it likely doesn't impose its own rate limits, relying instead on the limits of the API keys you use.

## Poe

Poe, developed by Quora, offers:

- **Model Variety**: Access to multiple AI models including ChatGPT, GPT-4, Claude Plus, and others[3].
- **Pricing**: Free tier available, with a Pro plan at $19.99 per month[3].
- **Rate Limits**: Specific limits aren't mentioned, but the paid plan likely offers higher usage caps.

## GitHub Models

While not a conversational interface, GitHub Models offers:

- **Model Access**: Free access to various AI models for prototyping[2].
- **Rate Limits**: Detailed rate limits based on account type (Free, Copilot Individual, Business, Enterprise)[2].
  - For example, "Low" tier models offer 15-20 requests per minute and 150-450 requests per day, depending on the account type.
- **Production Use**: Allows switching to Azure tokens for production use, potentially offering higher limits[2].

## Copilot by Microsoft

- **Model**: Uses GPT-4 combined with Bing search[3].
- **Features**: Offers different conversation styles and real-time internet access[3].
- **Rate Limits**: Not specifically mentioned, but as a Microsoft product, it may have higher limits than some alternatives.

## YouChat

- **Model**: Built on GPT-4[3].
- **Pricing**: Free tier available, with a Pro plan at $20 per month[3].
- **Features**: Integrated with the You.com search engine[3].

For power users prioritizing high rate limits and model variety, TypingMind appears to be the most flexible option, offering a wide range of models and customizable usage limits. GitHub Models could be an excellent choice for those needing specific rate limit information and the ability to scale to production. Poe and Copilot are also strong contenders, especially if you're looking for a balance between accessibility and advanced features.

To make the best choice, you might want to start free trials (where available) of these platforms to test their performance with your specific use cases and volume requirements.
