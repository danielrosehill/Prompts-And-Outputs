As of now, **Anthropic’s Claude 3** holds the record for the highest token limit among large language models (LLMs), with a maximum context window of **100,000 tokens**. This far surpasses the token limits of other models, including OpenAI’s GPT-4, which offers up to **32,768 tokens** in its largest configuration (the 32K model)【107†source】【108†source】.

Claude’s 100,000-token limit allows it to handle extremely large inputs, such as entire books or long technical documents, in a single session. This feature is particularly useful for complex tasks involving extended context, such as legal document analysis or in-depth technical reviews.
