### AI-Driven Company Discovery

If you're looking for a way to use AI to identify interesting companies, here are some ideas:

#### 1. **Use GPT-4 or LLMs for Web Scraping**
   - You could set up a web-scraping tool using GPT-4 or another language model to scrape public datasets or websites (like AngelList or Product Hunt) and compile lists of AI startups. Tools like **Beautiful Soup** and **Scrapy** can help with automation.
   
#### 2. **Custom AI-Powered Alerts**
   - You can set up **Google Alerts** with specific keywords like "AI startup funding" or "LLM company raises" to notify you about emerging companies in the AI space. Use an LLM to summarize or filter these alerts.
   
#### 3. **Social Media Monitoring with AI**
   - Tools like **Hootsuite** or **Brand24** can be used to track social media mentions of emerging AI companies. AI-driven analysis tools can help filter and identify trending companies or technologies on platforms like LinkedIn or Twitter.

By using these databases and AI tools, you can stay on top of the rapidly evolving AI and LLM space and find interesting companies for job-hunting purposes without going over budget.
