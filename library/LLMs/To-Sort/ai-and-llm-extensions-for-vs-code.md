*Note: this repository consists of the outputs of large language models (LLMs). In many cases, these are unedited or minimally edited. The information provided is for demonstrative purposes only and is intended to highlight constraints and capabilities in LLM applications and prompt engineering strategies.*


# Prompt

I'm planning on doing a lot of AI and LLM related work this year. Can you recommend any VS Code extensions that I might want to become familiar with?

# Output

Based on your interest in AI and LLM-related work, here are some VS Code extensions you should consider becoming familiar with:

## AI-Powered Coding Assistants

### GitHub Copilot

GitHub Copilot is one of the most popular AI-powered coding assistants[4]. It provides:

- Whole-line code completions
- Full-function completions  
- Natural language to code conversions
- AI-based security vulnerability filtering

Copilot can significantly boost your coding productivity for AI/ML projects[1][4].

### IntelliCode

Microsoft's IntelliCode extension enhances code completion by:

- Scanning thousands of open source repos to provide context-aware suggestions
- Offering whole-line completions
- Supporting TypeScript/JavaScript, Python, Java and T-SQL[4]

### Tabnine 

Tabnine is another popular AI autocomplete extension that:

- Provides whole-line and full-function completions
- Supports 25+ programming languages and frameworks
- Can generate unit testing code[4]

## Data Science & ML Tools

### Python

The Python extension is essential for data science work. It provides:

- Linting, debugging, code navigation
- Code formatting and refactoring
- Variable explorer and test explorer[3]

### Jupyter

The Jupyter extension allows you to work with Jupyter notebooks directly in VS Code[1][3]. 

### Jupyter Notebook Renderers

This extension enables interactive data visualization for Plotly, Vega, Bokeh and other formats within Jupyter notebooks[3].

### Azure Machine Learning

This extension integrates with Azure ML services, allowing you to:

- Manage experiments  
- Create and deploy models
- Work with compute instances[4]

## Version Control for ML

### DVC (Data Version Control)

DVC is crucial for versioning datasets, models and experiments. It allows you to:

- Version data and metadata
- Track and store experiments  
- Create data and ML pipelines
- Share versioned assets like Git[3]

## Language-Specific Tools

If you work with R or Julia for data science, consider their respective extensions:

### R

Provides R language support, R Markdown support, and data/plot viewing capabilities[3].

### Julia 

Offers Julia language support, REPL integration, and debugging tools[3].

By familiarizing yourself with these extensions, you'll have a powerful VS Code setup for AI and LLM-related work. Remember to customize your environment based on your specific needs and workflows.
