*Note: this repository consists of the outputs of large language models (LLMs). In many cases, these are unedited or minimally edited. The information provided is for demonstrative purposes only and is intended to highlight constraints and capabilities in LLM applications and prompt engineering strategies.*


# Prompt

I'm managing a Github repository Its purpose is to share the research work that I'm doing with LLMs Originally I created quite a lot of repos. Each repo was sharing a specific part of my research. For instance, I had repos for: - LLM agent configs - Interesting outputs - My prompt library I've decided that it would be nice to try to consolidate this information so that it's easier to find. You suggested addding the "component" repos as modules, which is what I've done. In the Github interface they stil link off to the original repos (I'd prefer if the data they contain was copied into the main repo). But it's a good start I'm thinking now about whether you might be able to think of a smart way to administer this large collection of repos. I use VS Code. Should I just work in the big repo? I don't want to have to switch repo every few minutes. But I think the segmentation is important for various reasons

# Output

Based on your situation, here are some recommendations for managing your consolidated repository effectively using VS Code:

1. Use a Multi-Root Workspace:
VS Code supports multi-root workspaces, which allows you to work with multiple repositories in a single window[7]. This feature is ideal for your setup:

- Open your main repository in VS Code
- Go to File -> Add Folder to Workspace
- Add each of your submodule repositories
- Save this workspace configuration (File -> Save Workspace As)

This way, you can access and work on all repositories simultaneously without switching contexts.

2. Leverage the Source Control View:
VS Code's source control view supports multiple repositories[7]. You can:

- See changes across all repositories
- Stage and commit changes to specific repositories
- Switch between repositories easily

3. Use the Git Lens Extension:
Git Lens enhances VS Code's Git capabilities and works well with multi-repository setups. It can help you:

- Visualize code authorship
- Explore repository history
- Compare branches across repositories

4. Consider Git Submodules:
While you've already added your component repos as modules, you mentioned preferring the data to be copied into the main repo. Git submodules might be a better fit for your use case[1]. They allow you to:

- Include other Git repositories as subdirectories
- Keep the submodule repos separate while still referencing them from the main repo
- Update submodules when needed

5. Organize with Folders:
Within your main repository, create a clear folder structure to organize your different research components. This can help maintain the segmentation you find important while keeping everything in one place.

6. Use Branch Management:
Create branches for different aspects of your research. This can help you:

- Work on specific components without affecting others
- Easily switch between different areas of focus
- Merge changes into the main branch when ready

7. Implement a Tagging Strategy:
Use Git tags to mark significant points in your research. This can help you:

- Easily reference specific states of your work
- Create "releases" of your research findings

8. Utilize VS Code's Search Functionality:
With everything in one repository (or a multi-root workspace), you can use VS Code's powerful search features to find information across all your research components quickly.

By implementing these strategies, you can maintain the segmentation of your research while working primarily in one VS Code window. This approach gives you the benefits of consolidated management without losing the organization of separate components.
