Popular LLM Models Among Business Users:

While the search results don't explicitly state which models are most popular among business users, several models are mentioned frequently in business contexts:

1. GPT-3 and GPT-4: These models from OpenAI are widely used across various industries for their versatility and powerful capabilities[5].

2. BERT: Google's BERT is popular for search-related tasks and natural language understanding[5].

3. T5: Another Google model, known for its versatility in handling various language tasks[5].

4. XLNet: Noted for outperforming BERT in multiple tasks[5].

5. Claude: Anthropic's model is gaining traction for its strong performance in reasoning tasks[5].

6. Codex: Specifically popular for code-related tasks[5].

7. Industry-specific models: Some industries are developing their own specialized LLMs, like BloombergGPT for finance[7].

Key Business Applications of LLMs:

1. Customer Service: Chatbots and virtual assistants for 24/7 support[1][2][4][5].
