can you recommend the biggest listing of LLMs and fine tuned models that I can find on the internet

# Output

Here are the best sources for finding comprehensive listings of large language models (LLMs) and fine-tuned versions across the web:

### **1. Hugging Face Model Hub**
- **Link**: [Hugging Face Model Hub](https://huggingface.co/models)
- **Description**: Hugging Face is the leading platform for finding open-source LLMs and fine-tuned models. It hosts thousands of pre-trained models, including those for **GPT-2**, **GPT-3**, **BERT**, **T5**, **BLOOM**, and more. Models are categorized by tasks like text generation, question answering, summarization, and translation. Many models include fine-tuned versions for specific domains or tasks, and you can filter models by language, task, or dataset.
  
### **2. OpenAI's GPT Models**
- **Link**: [OpenAI API](https://beta.openai.com/)
- **Description**: While OpenAI's models (like GPT-3, GPT-4) are proprietary and accessible through an API, they provide high-quality models fine-tuned for various tasks. You can explore OpenAI's API for custom fine-tuning, though it is a paid service. OpenAI also shares documentation on how to create fine-tuned models.

### **3. EleutherAI Models**
- **Link**: [EleutherAI](https://www.eleuther.ai/projects/)
- **Description**: EleutherAI hosts models like **GPT-Neo**, **GPT-J**, and **GPT-NeoX**, providing powerful open-source alternatives to proprietary models. Many of these models can be fine-tuned and accessed through platforms like Hugging Face.

### **4. The Pile**
- **Link**: [The Pile Dataset](https://github.com/EleutherAI/the-pile)
- **Description**: EleutherAI developed **The Pile**, a dataset used to train many open-source LLMs. If you're interested in fine-tuning, this is a rich dataset to explore. You can also find a community of researchers using this dataset for their own fine-tuned models.

### **5. BigScience Workshop / BLOOM**
- **Link**: [BLOOM Model on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/bloom)
- **Description**: **BLOOM** is a massive open-access multilingual language model with 176 billion parameters. It was developed by the **BigScience Workshop** and is available for fine-tuning. Hugging Face also hosts fine-tuned versions of BLOOM for various languages and tasks.

### **6. Model Zoo (PyTorch and TensorFlow)**
- **Link**: [PyTorch Hub](https://pytorch.org/hub/) | [TensorFlow Hub](https://tfhub.dev/)
- **Description**: Both **PyTorch Hub** and **TensorFlow Hub** offer a wide range of models pre-trained on various tasks. These platforms provide models in different sizes and configurations, including LLMs like BERT, T5, and GPT-based models. Fine-tuned versions for tasks like sentiment analysis, summarization, and more are also available.

### **7. Google Cloud AI Hub**
- **Link**: [Google Cloud AI Hub](https://cloud.google.com/ai-hub)
- **Description**: Google's **AI Hub** provides a large collection of machine learning models and AI pipelines, including fine-tuned models for text, vision, and other tasks. You can search for LLMs fine-tuned for specific tasks.

### **8. Model Zoo on GitHub**
- **Link**: [GitHub Model Zoo](https://github.com/search?q=transformer+models)
- **Description**: Many researchers and developers share their custom and fine-tuned models on **GitHub**. Searching for repositories tagged with **transformer models**, **GPT**, **BERT**, or **LLM** can give you access to various fine-tuned models. 

### **9. OpenML**
- **Link**: [OpenML](https://www.openml.org/)
- **Description**: **OpenML** is a platform for sharing machine learning datasets, models, and experiments. You can find LLMs trained on different datasets and tasks, as well as models fine-tuned for specific applications.

### **10. NLP Progress**
- **Link**: [NLP Progress](https://nlpprogress.com/)
- **Description**: While not a model hub, **NLP Progress** tracks the state-of-the-art models and benchmarks across a wide variety of NLP tasks, which often include LLMs and their fine-tuned variants. Itâ€™s a good resource for finding top-performing models in specific tasks.

These resources provide the largest listings of LLMs and fine-tuned models, offering a combination of proprietary, open-source, and community-driven models. If you're looking to experiment with or fine-tune models, these platforms will have what you need.
