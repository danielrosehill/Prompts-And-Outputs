# Prompt

Okay, that's cheaper than I expected.

Could you generate a detailed guide on how I might go about deploying this system

Simplify the system as much as possible. This is more a proof of concept type program than a real program. But of course it would need to work on some level.

# Output

Certainly! I'll provide a detailed guide on how to deploy a simplified version of this system as a proof of concept. This guide will focus on using Python with the OpenAI API to analyze your Markdown files and generate a report of the most interesting outputs.

## Detailed Guide for Deploying the System

### Step 1: Set Up Your Environment

1. Create a new Python virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv llm_analyzer_env
   source llm_analyzer_env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: llm_analyzer_env\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. Install required packages:
   ```
   pip install openai tqdm
   ```

3. Set up your OpenAI API key as an environment variable:
   ```
   export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'
   ```

### Step 2: Create the Python Script

Create a new file named `analyze_outputs.py` and add the following code:

```python
import os
import openai
from tqdm import tqdm

# Set up OpenAI API key
openai.api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")

def analyze_file(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
        content = file.read()

    prompt = f"Analyze the following AI output and rate its interestingness on a scale of 1-10. Provide a brief explanation for your rating:\n\n{content}"

    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI assistant tasked with analyzing the interestingness of AI outputs."},
            {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
        ],
        max_tokens=150
    )

    return response.choices[0].message['content']

def main():
    vault_path = "/path/to/your/obsidian/vault"
    results = []

    for root, _, files in os.walk(vault_path):
        for file in tqdm(files, desc="Analyzing files"):
            if file.endswith('.md'):
                file_path = os.path.join(root, file)
                analysis = analyze_file(file_path)
                results.append((file, analysis))

    # Sort results by interestingness rating (assuming the rating is the first number in the analysis)
    sorted_results = sorted(results, key=lambda x: int(x[1].split()[0]), reverse=True)

    # Generate report
    report = "Top 20 Most Interesting AI Outputs:\n\n"
    for i, (file, analysis) in enumerate(sorted_results[:20], 1):
        report += f"{i}. {file}\n{analysis}\n\n"

    with open("interesting_outputs_report.txt", "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
        f.write(report)

    print("Analysis complete. Report saved as 'interesting_outputs_report.txt'")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Step 3: Run the Script

1. Replace `/path/to/your/obsidian/vault` in the script with the actual path to your Obsidian vault.

2. Run the script:
   ```
   python analyze_outputs.py
   ```

3. The script will process all Markdown files in your vault, analyze them using GPT-3.5 Turbo, and generate a report of the 20 most interesting outputs.

### Step 4: Review the Results

Once the script completes, you'll find a file named `interesting_outputs_report.txt` in the same directory as your script. This report will contain the top 20 most interesting AI outputs, along with brief explanations for their ratings.

## Key Points of the Implementation

1. **File Traversal**: The script uses `os.walk()` to recursively traverse your Obsidian vault and find all Markdown files.

2. **Analysis**: Each file is analyzed using GPT-3.5 Turbo. The AI is prompted to rate the interestingness of the content and provide a brief explanation.

3. **Progress Tracking**: The `tqdm` library is used to display a progress bar, giving you visibility into the analysis process.

4. **Sorting and Reporting**: Results are sorted based on the interestingness rating, and the top 20 are included in the final report.

## Potential Improvements

1. **Error Handling**: Add try-except blocks to handle potential errors when reading files or making API calls.

2. **Batching**: If you have a large number of files, you might want to implement batching to process files in smaller groups.

3. **Customization**: You could add command-line arguments to allow customization of the vault path, number of top results, etc.

4. **Caching**: Implement a caching mechanism to avoid re-analyzing files that haven't changed since the last run.

This simplified proof-of-concept should give you a good starting point for analyzing your AI outputs. You can then expand and refine the system based on your specific needs and observations from this initial implementation.
