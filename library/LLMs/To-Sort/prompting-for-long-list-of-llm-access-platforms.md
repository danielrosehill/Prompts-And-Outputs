*Note: this repository consists of the outputs of large language models (LLMs). In many cases, these are unedited or minimally edited. The information provided is for demonstrative purposes only and is intended to highlight constraints and capabilities in LLM applications and prompt engineering strategies.*


# Prompt

are there more tools out there like typing mind poe and ai playground? tools that allow you to have conversational experiences with a wide variety of different llm models made by different companies?

# Output 1 (Claude)

Yes, there are several other platforms that allow users to interact with multiple LLMs from different companies in a conversational manner. Here's an expanded list of such tools:

## Multi-LLM Interaction Platforms

**FastChat**
FastChat is an open-source platform that serves as a distributed multi-model LLM serving system[1]. It enables users to interact with various open-source models, making it easier to deploy and compare different LLMs.

**Haystack**
Haystack is an open-source NLP framework that supports integration with multiple LLMs for various natural language processing tasks[1]. It allows users to work with different models and compare their performance for specific use cases.

**Multi-LLM Chat**
This is an application that allows for interaction with different LLM models[4]. It provides a web-based interface where users can query a collection of LLM models. Additionally, it offers the option to provide PDF, web, and CSV links for context, enhancing the conversational experience.

**Open Router**
Open Router is a unified API service that routes requests through various large language models from different providers[3]. It allows users to access and compare outputs from multiple LLMs, including both free and paid options. Open Router uses an API style similar to OpenAI, making it easy to integrate into existing workflows.

**Poe**
Poe, developed by Quora, is a comprehensive platform for interacting with various LLMs[2]. It offers access to multiple AI models, including GPT-4, DALL-E 3, Claude 2, Claude 3, StableDiffusion XL, and Gemini Pro. Poe's new multi-bot chat feature allows users to compare responses from different models in a single conversation, making it easier to find the best model for specific tasks.

**SillyTavern**
SillyTavern is an open-source platform that supports interaction with multiple AI models for creative writing and storytelling[1]. It allows users to create "group chats" with different "contacts" which are essentially saved prompts, enabling sequential interactions between different AI personas.

**SkyPilot**
SkyPilot is a versatile tool that enables running and interacting with various LLMs on different cloud platforms[1]. It provides a flexible environment for deploying and managing multiple language models, allowing users to compare and utilize different LLMs based on their needs.

**TypingMind**
TypingMind is an all-in-one AI platform that helps users interact with multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and many other open-source AI models[3]. It allows users to connect with as many AI models as they want using their API keys, switch between different models to compare results, and combine AI models with plugins for enhanced functionality.

These platforms offer users the flexibility to work with multiple LLMs, compare their outputs, and choose the best model for specific tasks without being limited to a single provider's offerings. They cater to various needs, from simple comparisons to more complex workflows involving multiple AI models.
