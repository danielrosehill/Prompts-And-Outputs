*Note: this repository consists of the outputs of large language models (LLMs). In many cases, these are unedited or minimally edited. The information provided is for demonstrative purposes only and is intended to highlight constraints and capabilities in LLM applications and prompt engineering strategies.*


# Prompt
which general purpose LLMs have APIs that are the most suitable for prompting work at scale? Ideally we'd be looking at minimal token limits on both inputs and outputs and a cost effective pricing model. Do any stand out as particularly suitable for these requirements?

# Output
Based on the information provided and your specific requirements for prompting work at scale with minimal token limits and cost-effective pricing, a few LLM APIs stand out as particularly suitable:

1. Anthropic's Claude 3 Models:
   - Claude 3 Haiku offers a very competitive pricing model at $0.25/1M input tokens and $1.25/1M output tokens [3].
   - It has a large 200K token context window, allowing for extensive inputs and outputs [3].
   - Claude models are known for their strong performance and capabilities.

2. Mistral AI's Models:
   - Mistral Small offers pricing at $2/1M input tokens and $6/1M output tokens [2].
   - It has a 32K token context window, which is substantial for most applications [2].
   - Mistral models are gaining recognition for their efficiency and performance.

3. Meta's Llama 3 Models (via Deepinfra):
   - Llama 3.1 70b is priced at $0.59/1M input tokens and $0.79/1M output tokens [2].
   - It offers a large 128K token context window [2].
   - Llama models are open-source and have shown impressive capabilities.

4. Google's Gemini 1.5 Flash:
   - Offers very competitive pricing at $0.075/1M input tokens and $0.03/1M output tokens for the 128K context version [2].
   - The 1M context version is even cheaper at $0.015/1M input tokens and $0.06/1M output tokens [2].
   - Gemini models are known for their strong performance and large context windows.

5. OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo:
   - While not the cheapest, it offers a good balance of performance and cost at $0.5/1M input tokens and $1.5/1M output tokens [2].
   - It has a 16K token context window, which is suitable for many applications [2].
   - GPT-3.5 Turbo is widely used and has a proven track record.

These models stand out for their combination of large context windows (allowing for minimal token limits on both inputs and outputs) and relatively cost-effective pricing models. The choice between them would depend on your specific use case, required capabilities, and budget constraints.

For work at scale, it's also worth considering:

1. API stability and reliability
2. Scalability of the service
3. Available SDKs and integration options
4. Fine-tuning capabilities if needed for your specific domain

Additionally, some providers offer volume discounts or custom pricing for large-scale usage, which could be worth exploring if you anticipate very high volume usage.
