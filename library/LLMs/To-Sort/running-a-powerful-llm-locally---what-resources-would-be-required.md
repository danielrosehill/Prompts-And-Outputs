# Prompt

If I wanted to run a local LLM that approximated the power of GPT 4 turbo .. what kind of resources would I need in terms of HW?

# Output

To run **GPT-4 Turbo** (or something close to its performance without any compromises), we would need to consider the massive scale and computational requirements that such a model entails. GPT-4 has potentially hundreds of billions of parameters, which makes it one of the largest and most computationally demanding models to run. The hardware requirements reflect this, and here’s a no-compromise approach:

### Ultimate Hardware Setup to Run GPT-4 Turbo Locally

#### 1. **GPUs: NVIDIA H100 or A100 (Multiple Units)**
   - **NVIDIA H100 (80 GB VRAM)**: The NVIDIA H100 is the most powerful AI accelerator currently available, designed specifically for handling the computational loads of large language models. For a full-scale GPT-4 Turbo model, you would need multiple H100 GPUs to accommodate the massive number of parameters and the speed required for inference and training.
   - **Recommended Setup**: 
     - **4x NVIDIA H100 (80 GB VRAM)** GPUs: A system with four H100s would provide around **320 GB of VRAM** combined, which should be sufficient for inference for GPT-4 Turbo-sized models. 
     - For training, you'd need even more GPUs, so scaling up to **8 GPUs** may be necessary depending on the size of the model you are working with.
   - **Alternative (slightly less powerful)**: 
     - **4x NVIDIA A100 (80 GB VRAM)** GPUs: The A100 is the previous generation's workhorse for AI, still immensely powerful. You'd need at least 4-8 GPUs to handle GPT-4 Turbo efficiently.

#### 2. **CPU: AMD EPYC or Intel Xeon Scalable (High-Core Count)**
   - **AMD EPYC 7763** or **Intel Xeon Platinum 8380**: These server-grade processors are ideal for handling massive parallel processing tasks and feeding data to the GPUs. 
     - **96 cores (dual processor setup)** would give you significant computational power for managing the flow of data during training and inference, managing multiple processes, and handling the CPU-side operations of the LLM.
   - **Recommended Setup**: 
     - **2x AMD EPYC 7763 (64 cores each)** or **2x Intel Xeon Platinum 8380 (40 cores each)**.
     - The AMD EPYC series provides more cores per processor, which is ideal for parallel workloads.

#### 3. **RAM: 1 TB DDR4/DDR5 ECC Memory**
   - To run and manage GPT-4 Turbo’s enormous parameter sizes, fast access to large amounts of system memory is required. During inference, you will need substantial RAM to handle large batches and ensure the system operates smoothly.
   - **Recommended Setup**: 
     - **1 TB DDR4/DDR5 ECC RAM**: Error-Correcting Code (ECC) memory is important for data integrity, especially in large-scale processing tasks.
     - For a full GPT-4 Turbo-level model, 1 TB ensures you're future-proofed for even the largest workloads.

#### 4. **Storage: NVMe SSD (High-Capacity, Fast Read/Write)**
   - **Fast NVMe storage** is crucial for loading model weights, datasets, and handling read/write operations during fine-tuning or inference. GPT models require a tremendous amount of storage for both the model itself and the associated data.
   - **Recommended Setup**:
     - **2x 8 TB NVMe PCIe Gen4 SSDs**: High-speed NVMe SSDs with **7,000 MB/s read/write speeds** ensure that massive datasets and model files are loaded quickly.
     - Consider **RAID 0** for maximizing performance if you need even higher throughput for sequential data reads.

#### 5. **Networking: 10/100 Gbps Infiniband or Ethernet**
   - If you’re running multiple GPUs across nodes, **high-speed networking** becomes crucial to minimize latency and bottlenecks when GPUs share workloads. Infiniband is often used in data centers for AI and deep learning workloads.
   - **Recommended Setup**:
     - **100 Gbps Infiniband Networking** for ultra-low latency and high bandwidth communication between GPUs and the rest of the system.
     - Alternatively, **10 Gbps Ethernet** could suffice for local single-node setups, but it's better to future-proof for larger multi-node systems.

#### 6. **Power Supply and Cooling**
   - Powering and cooling multiple GPUs is challenging, especially with high-power GPUs like the H100 and A100. Each H100 can pull around **350-700W** depending on its mode.
   - **Recommended Setup**:
     - **2x 2000W PSUs** (for redundancy and load balancing).
     - **Custom Liquid Cooling**: For multi-GPU setups, air cooling becomes impractical. Liquid cooling solutions (or water-cooled racks) will ensure that the system operates efficiently under full load.
     - **Server Chassis**: Use a high-end server chassis (e.g., a **Supermicro 4U GPU server**) capable of housing and cooling multiple GPUs and processors.

#### 7. **Motherboard**
   - To support multiple GPUs and dual CPUs, you’ll need a **server-grade motherboard** with enough PCIe lanes for GPU expansion.
   - **Recommended Setup**:
     - **ASRock Rack EPYCD8-2T** (for AMD EPYC CPUs) or **Supermicro X12SPA-TF** (for Intel Xeon), with support for multiple PCIe Gen4 lanes to handle up to 4-8 GPUs.

#### 8. **Operating System & Software**
   - **Linux (Ubuntu, Fedora, CentOS)**: Most deep learning systems are run on Linux for better GPU driver support (NVIDIA CUDA, cuDNN), and it's highly optimized for server workloads.
   - **NVIDIA CUDA & cuDNN**: Essential libraries for deep learning tasks on NVIDIA hardware.
   - **Deep Learning Frameworks**: Use frameworks like **PyTorch** or **TensorFlow** for running GPT models. You may need additional libraries for model parallelism if you're spreading the load across multiple GPUs.
