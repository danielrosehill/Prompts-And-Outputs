# Prompt

It might be interesting to publish my ChatGPT OSINT report into the Iran missile attack on some blog publishing platform. However I worry about censorship given the sensitive nature of the topic. Can you suggest any places that it might be possible to post something related to war and military topics and which has specifically adopted a policy to not censor posts like this?

# Output



Publishing sensitive topics like military conflicts and war-related analyses can be challenging due to concerns over censorship. However, there are platforms that are more lenient or explicitly committed to free speech, allowing for uncensored discussions on such topics. Here are a few suggestions for places where you might be able to publish your ChatGPT OSINT report on the Iranian missile attack:

### 1. **Substack**
   - **Policy**: Substack is known for its free-speech ethos, and many journalists, political commentators, and analysts use it to share uncensored work. Substack has gained popularity for allowing users to publish sensitive topics without censorship, provided it doesn’t violate local laws.
   - **Why It Works**: You maintain control of your audience and content, and you can publish sensitive topics, including war and military content, without the platform removing your work.
   - **Website**: [Substack](https://www.substack.com)

### 2. **Ghost (Self-Hosted Blog)**
   - **Policy**: **Ghost** is an open-source platform where you can host your blog on your own server. This means you retain full control over your content, and censorship is not an issue unless imposed by the hosting provider or legal regulations.
   - **Why It Works**: Since it's self-hosted, the only limitations are those you impose on yourself. You can create a site dedicated to military and geopolitical analysis.
   - **Website**: [Ghost](https://ghost.org)

### 3. **Medium**
   - **Policy**: Medium is a popular blogging platform with a wide audience, and although it does moderate content, it has been relatively lenient with posts on geopolitics, military conflicts, and war analysis. The platform generally focuses on removing hate speech or incitement to violence rather than censoring controversial topics.
   - **Why It Works**: Medium has a huge audience, so you can reach many readers. However, while they don't explicitly censor war-related topics, be aware of their content guidelines.
   - **Website**: [Medium](https://www.medium.com)

### 4. **WordPress (Self-Hosted)**
   - **Policy**: Like Ghost, you can set up a self-hosted WordPress blog. Self-hosted WordPress allows you complete control over your content and is a popular option for bloggers who want to avoid censorship. You can choose a hosting provider known for its free speech policy.
   - **Why It Works**: If censorship is a major concern, self-hosting your blog with a provider that upholds free speech ensures you remain uncensored.
   - **Website**: [WordPress.org](https://www.wordpress.org)

### 5. **Write.as**
   - **Policy**: Write.as is an anonymous blogging platform that values privacy and free speech. It allows users to write about sensitive topics without fear of censorship. The platform is designed to be minimalist, free from distraction, and anonymous.
   - **Why It Works**: Write.as offers a space where you can publish sensitive material anonymously, making it a good choice for topics like war and military analysis that may provoke controversy.
   - **Website**: [Write.as](https://write.as)

### 6. **Steemit**
   - **Policy**: **Steemit** is a blockchain-based social media and blogging platform that promotes free speech and decentralized content publishing. Since content is stored on a blockchain, it is harder to censor than on traditional platforms.
   - **Why It Works**: Steemit is ideal for sensitive topics due to its decentralized nature, and censorship is highly unlikely unless the content breaks community guidelines or laws.
   - **Website**: [Steemit](https://www.steemit.com)

### 7. **Minds**
   - **Policy**: **Minds** is a blockchain-based social media platform that promotes free expression and censorship resistance. The platform has been designed specifically to allow users to post content that may be considered controversial on other sites, as long as it doesn't break any laws.
   - **Why It Works**: Minds has a strong commitment to free speech and is a platform that attracts those who want to share military, political, or sensitive content without fear of censorship.
   - **Website**: [Minds](https://www.minds.com)

### 8. **Diaspora**
   - **Policy**: **Diaspora** is a decentralized social network where you retain ownership of your data and content. You choose where to host your content and who has access to it, ensuring complete control and minimizing censorship risks.
   - **Why It Works**: Since Diaspora is decentralized, it's hard for any entity to impose censorship on your posts. It’s a good platform for sharing war-related and military analysis.
   - **Website**: [Diaspora](https://diasporafoundation.org)

### 9. **Gab**
   - **Policy**: Gab is a social media platform with a strong commitment to free speech, often attracting content that is censored elsewhere. It markets itself as a free-speech alternative to Twitter and allows for posts on controversial topics such as geopolitics and military conflicts.
   - **Why It Works**: If you're looking for a platform with minimal censorship and an audience interested in geopolitical and military topics, Gab is a strong option. However, be aware of the platform's reputation and audience base.

### 10. **Uncensored Platforms for Paid Content**
   - **Patreon** (or alternatives like **Ko-Fi** or **Liberapay**) can also be used for publishing sensitive content. While these platforms primarily host paid content, they offer more flexibility in how and what you publish, as long as it doesn’t violate legal norms.
   - **Why It Works**: These platforms allow you to reach niche audiences and share sensitive content with fewer restrictions compared to mainstream publishing platforms.

### 11. **Telegram Channels**
   - **Policy**: **Telegram** allows for the creation of private or public channels where you can share long-form content or files without censorship. Many geopolitical analysts and OSINT professionals use Telegram to share sensitive or controversial topics.
   - **Why It Works**: Telegram’s channel system allows for censorship-free communication and content distribution. It's especially useful if you're looking to build a community around your content.
   - **Website**: [Telegram](https://telegram.org)

### 12. **PeerTube**
   - **Policy**: **PeerTube** is a decentralized video hosting platform that allows for freedom of expression, free from centralized censorship. It operates using a federated model, making it hard for any one party to remove content.
   - **Why It Works**: If you are considering turning your OSINT analysis into a video or multimedia report, PeerTube’s decentralized model ensures it remains online without the risk of centralized censorship.
   - **Website**: [PeerTube](https://joinpeertube.org)

### Important Considerations:
- **Hosting Provider**: If you go for self-hosting (using WordPress or Ghost), ensure your hosting provider also supports free speech. Some hosting services might still take down sites under pressure, so opt for providers that are committed to free speech like **Epik** or **OrangeWebsite**.
- **Legal Considerations**: While these platforms may offer more freedom from censorship, you should still be aware of the legal restrictions in the country you are publishing from or targeting.

By selecting one of these platforms, you can publish your OSINT report on sensitive topics with a lower risk of censorship. Would you like more guidance on setting up a blog or how to best format your OSINT analysis for publication?
