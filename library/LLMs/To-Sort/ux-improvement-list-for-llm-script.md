# Output

After reviewing the Python script for the Obsidian Vault Prompt Runner application, here are some UX and design improvements that could be easily implemented:

## User Interface Enhancements

1. **Add tooltips**: Implement tooltips for buttons and input fields to provide quick explanations of their functions[1].

2. **Keyboard shortcuts**: Introduce keyboard shortcuts for common actions like running the prompt (e.g., Ctrl+R) or saving the configuration (e.g., Ctrl+S)[1].

3. **Drag and drop**: Allow users to drag and drop text files into the prompt input area for quick loading of prompts[1].

4. **Recent prompts**: Add a dropdown menu to show recently used prompts for easy access[1].

5. **Auto-save**: Implement an auto-save feature for the prompt input to prevent loss of work[1].

## Visual Improvements

6. **Custom styling**: Create a custom style sheet for both light and dark modes to improve visual consistency and aesthetics[1].

7. **Progress indicator**: Replace the progress bar with a more modern, animated progress indicator for a sleeker look[1].

8. **Resizable panels**: Allow users to resize the prompt input and terminal output areas to their preference[1].

9. **Font selection**: Add an option for users to choose their preferred font for the input and output areas[1].

## Functionality Enhancements

10. **Export options**: Provide options to export the prompt and output in various formats (e.g., PDF, HTML) in addition to Markdown[1].

11. **Template system**: Implement a template system for commonly used prompt structures[1].

12. **Character limit warning**: Add a visual indicator when approaching the model's maximum token limit[1].

13. **Multi-file processing**: Allow users to run multiple prompts in batch mode[1].

14. **History view**: Create a separate tab or window to view the history of processed prompts and their outputs[1].

## Settings and Configuration

15. **API key management**: Implement a more secure way to store and manage API keys, possibly using environment variables or a dedicated credentials manager[1].

16. **Model information**: Display information about the selected model, including its capabilities and token limits[1].

17. **Customizable file naming**: Allow users to define their own file naming conventions for saved prompts and outputs[1].

These suggestions aim to enhance the user experience, improve the visual appeal, and add useful functionality to the Obsidian Vault Prompt Runner application while maintaining its core features and ease of use.
