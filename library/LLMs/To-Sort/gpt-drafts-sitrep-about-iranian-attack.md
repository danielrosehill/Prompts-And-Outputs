### **1. Overview**
On October 1, 2024, Iran launched **181 ballistic missiles** at various targets in Israel in an unprecedented attack. This marked one of the largest missile assaults during the ongoing Iran-Israel conflict and was part of **Operation True Promise 2**, which Iran framed as retaliation for Israel’s assassinations of high-ranking figures, including **Hassan Nasrallah** (Hezbollah), **Ismail Haniyeh** (Hamas), and **IRGC General Abbas Nilforoushan**【36†source】【37†source】.

### **2. Incident Summary**

  - **Nevatim Airbase**: Several missiles struck near the airbase, causing damage to a hangar and taxiways but avoiding key military assets.
  - **Jerusalem**: Air defenses intercepted incoming missiles over the city, with minimal impact.
  - **Other Targets**: Missiles also hit sites near **Tel Nof Airbase** and civilian areas in **Gedera**【37†source】【39†source】.

### **3. Attack Details**

  - **Ballistic Missiles**: Iran deployed **Fattah-1** and **Kheibar Shekan** missiles, advanced models capable of reaching Israel in approximately 12 minutes.

- **Casualties**: 
  - **Israeli Military**: No reported casualties among military personnel.

  - Damage to military infrastructure was limited, with minor hits reported at **Nevatim** and **Tel Nof** airbases. Homes and restaurants in civilian areas north of Tel Aviv sustained damage【36†source】【39†source】.

### **4. Immediate Response**
- **IDF Actions**:
  - **Interceptions**: The Israeli Air Force and missile defense systems intercepted the majority of the incoming missiles.
  - **Military Alert**: The IDF has raised the alert level and warned of potential follow-up attacks. Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, IDF spokesperson, confirmed that Israel’s Air Force remains operational and will launch retaliatory strikes.
