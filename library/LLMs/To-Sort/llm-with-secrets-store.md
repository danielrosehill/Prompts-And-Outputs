# Prompt

I'd like to develop an LLM which could have access to my secrets store so that when I asked it to generate code I didn't have to manually update the variables every time. Any ideas for how to do this?

# Output

One possible solution could be to integrate your LLM with a secrets management system like HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager. This way, your LLM can securely access the necessary credentials and other sensitive information without exposing them in the generated code.

You could also consider creating a custom plugin for your LLM that interfaces with your secrets store. This plugin could handle the retrieval of secrets and automatically inject them into the code generation process, reducing the need for manual updates.

Additionally, you may want to explore using environment variables or configuration files to store and access sensitive information in a more secure manner within your LLM. By leveraging these methods, you can ensure that your secrets are kept safe and not hardcoded into your codebase.

Overall, integrating your LLM with a secrets store can help streamline your code generation process while maintaining security best practices.
