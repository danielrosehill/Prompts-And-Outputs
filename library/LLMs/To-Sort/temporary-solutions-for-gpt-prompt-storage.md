can you think of a simple stopgap solution i can use for saving my gpt prompts and outputs until my actual product is ready and implemented?

# Output

Certainly! Here are a few simple stopgap solutions you can use to save your GPT prompts and outputs until your "Output Hub" product is ready:

### 1. **Google Sheets**
   - **Overview:** Google Sheets is an accessible and easy-to-use tool where you can store your prompts and outputs in a structured manner.
   - **Implementation:**
     - Create a new Google Sheet with columns for `Prompt`, `Output`, `Date`, `GPT Configuration`, and `Notes`.
     - Manually enter your prompts and their corresponding outputs.
     - Use Google Sheets’ `Filter` and `Search` functionalities to organize and retrieve your data.

### 2. **Notion**
   - **Overview:** Notion can serve as a temporary database where you can create entries for each prompt and output.
   - **Implementation:**
     - Create a table in Notion with fields for `Prompt`, `Output`, `Date`, `GPT Configuration`, and `Tags`.
     - You can easily link related prompts and outputs and use tags to categorize them.
     - Use Notion’s rich text editor to format your data and keep everything organized in one place.

### 3. **Markdown Files in a GitHub Repository**
   - **Overview:** If you prefer a more developer-oriented approach, you can use Markdown files stored in a GitHub repository to save your prompts and outputs.
   - **Implementation:**
     - Create a folder structure in your repository, e.g., `/prompts` and `/outputs`.
     - Save each prompt in a Markdown file, with the corresponding output in a separate file.
     - Link the files together by adding a reference to the output file in the prompt file and vice versa.
     - Use GitHub's search and tagging features to manage your data.

### 4. **Obsidian**
   - **Overview:** Obsidian is a powerful note-taking tool that supports Markdown and allows for linking between notes.
   - **Implementation:**
     - Create a vault in Obsidian where you store your prompts and outputs.
     - Use a folder structure similar to the GitHub solution, or simply tag notes to link them.
     - Take advantage of Obsidian’s backlinking feature to connect prompts and outputs.
     - Use plugins like Dataview to query and filter your data.

### 5. **Airtable**
   - **Overview:** Airtable is a flexible, spreadsheet-like database tool that can be quickly set up for managing your prompts and outputs.
   - **Implementation:**
     - Create a new base with tables for `Prompts`, `Outputs`, and `GPT Configurations`.
     - Link related records between tables to reflect the relationships between prompts and outputs.
     - Airtable’s filtering and sorting options can help you manage and retrieve your data efficiently.

### 6. **Simple Web Form with Google Forms**
   - **Overview:** If you want a very quick and simple setup, you can use Google Forms to create a form for submitting prompts and storing outputs.
   - **Implementation:**
     - Create a Google Form with fields for `Prompt`, `Output`, `GPT Configuration`, and any additional notes.
     - Link the form to a Google Sheet where all submissions will be stored.
     - You can manually export the data from Google Sheets to another system later on.

### 7. **Evernote**
   - **Overview:** Evernote allows for easy note creation and tagging, making it a good option for storing and categorizing prompts and outputs.
   - **Implementation:**
     - Create a notebook specifically for GPT prompts and outputs.
     - For each prompt-output pair, create a new note with tags like `#Prompt`, `#Output`, `#GPTConfig`, etc.
     - Use Evernote’s search and tagging features to find and organize your data.

### Summary
For simplicity and ease of access, **Google Sheets** or **Notion** are likely your best bets. They both offer flexibility, are easy to set up, and allow you to start capturing data immediately with minimal overhead. Once your full system is ready, you can easily export or migrate the data to your new platform.
