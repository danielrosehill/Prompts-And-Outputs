The correct terminology for **custom GPTs**, where users define their own instructions for specific purposes, is typically referred to as **"Custom GPTs"** or **"Custom Models"** in the context of GPT itself.

In other **Large Language Models (LLMs)** or platforms, similar concepts might be referred to as:

- **Fine-tuned models**: Refers to LLMs that have been specifically trained or adapted for a particular task or dataset using additional training beyond the base model.
- **Prompt engineering**: This involves creating carefully structured instructions to guide the modelâ€™s behavior, though this generally refers more to the design of specific interactions than a fully customized model.
- **Agents**: Some platforms, especially in AI automation and task completion contexts, use the term "agents" for custom-defined AI setups that perform specific tasks based on user-defined prompts and configurations.
- **Custom assistants**: A general term used when building AI setups tailored for specific use cases, where the assistant follows predefined behaviors.
- **LLM applications** or **LLM-powered apps**: In some platforms, custom configurations or instances of LLMs designed for specific tasks might be called "apps" or "LLM-powered applications."

In most contexts, **custom GPTs** or **custom models** accurately describe user-defined configurations of GPT or similar models used for specific purposes.
