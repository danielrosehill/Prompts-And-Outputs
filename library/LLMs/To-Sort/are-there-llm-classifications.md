*Note: this repository consists of the outputs of large language models (LLMs). In many cases, these are unedited or minimally edited. The information provided is for demonstrative purposes only and is intended to highlight constraints and capabilities in LLM applications and prompt engineering strategies.*


# Prompt

How are LLMs classified formally? You talked about the "top models". Is that an informal term? And if so what models are typically understood as being in that bracket. Do you think it's fair to say that there are mid tier LLMs and up and coming LLMs?

# Output

The classification of LLMs is not strictly formalized, and the term "top models" is indeed somewhat informal. However, there are several ways the AI community and researchers typically categorize and rank LLMs:

## Performance-based Classification

LLMs are often classified based on their performance on standardized benchmarks and tasks:

1. **Top-tier Models**: These are the best-performing LLMs across a wide range of tasks. Currently, this bracket typically includes:
   - GPT-4
   - Claude 3 (Opus)
   - PaLM 2 (Google's model powering Gemini)

2. **Mid-tier Models**: These perform well but may not match the top tier in all areas:
   - GPT-3.5
   - Claude 2
   - Gemini Pro
   - Anthropic's earlier Claude models

3. **Emerging or Specialized Models**: These include promising new models or those excelling in specific domains:
   - Mistral AI's models
   - Meta's LLaMA 2
   - Specialized coding models like CodeLlama

## Size-based Classification

LLMs are also often categorized by their parameter count:

- **Large**: Models with billions of parameters (e.g., GPT-3 with 175B parameters)
- **Medium**: Models in the range of tens of billions of parameters
- **Small**: Models with fewer than 10 billion parameters, often designed for efficiency

## Accessibility Classification

1. **Closed-source Models**: Proprietary models with limited access (e.g., GPT-4, Claude)
2. **Open-source Models**: Freely available models (e.g., LLaMA, BLOOM)
3. **API-accessible Models**: Models available through commercial APIs

## Generational Classification

Informal terms like "next-gen" or "current-gen" are sometimes used to distinguish newer, more advanced models from their predecessors.

## Up-and-Coming LLMs

It's fair to say there are "up-and-coming" LLMs. These are often:

1. Models from newer companies or research labs showing promising results
2. Open-source models rapidly improving through community efforts
3. Specialized models pushing boundaries in specific domains

Examples include:
- Anthropic's Claude 3 series, which has shown significant improvements
- Open-source models like Mistral AI's offerings
- Specialized models like DeepMind's AlphaCode for programming tasks

The field of LLMs is rapidly evolving, with new models and improvements constantly emerging. Classifications and rankings can change quickly as new benchmarks are established and models are updated[1][2][3].
