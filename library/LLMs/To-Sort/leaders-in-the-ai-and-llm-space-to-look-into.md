# Prompt

Please provide me with a list of companies I should consider approaching given my growing focus in the world of AI and LLMs and how they can be leveraged in myriad ways in professional and personal contexts. Who's innovative and exciting in this space and is particularly focused on business use-cases like custom LLM agents. 

For each company you can think of, consider whether they might realistically have an interest in working with someone like me who's more of an ideator and explorer and not a developer (I'm open to roles in product and communications especially). 

Finally for the companies you find, see if they have an openeness to hiring remotely, especially for non-US-based people. 

For each company that you can find, please provide
