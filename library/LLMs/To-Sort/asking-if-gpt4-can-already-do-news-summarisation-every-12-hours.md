The information provided is for demonstrative purposes only and is intended to highlight constraints and capabilities in LLM applications and prompt engineering strategies.*


# Prompt

Here's what I'm looking for. You're familiar with the news monitoring project and what situational reports are (SITREPs). I'd love to have an LLM deliver an accurate one to me every 12 hours summarising the latest developments from a strictly pragmatic lens focused on military developments. Can GPT 4o do that already (with web browsing)? Are we nearing that capability?

# Output

As of now, GPT-4 with web browsing can assist in creating situational reports (SITREPs) on military developments by retrieving, analyzing, and summarizing the latest information from the web. However, there are some limitations and areas where this capability is improving but not yet fully autonomous.

### What GPT-4 with Web Browsing Can Do:

1. **Summarization**: GPT-4 can generate detailed summaries of the latest military developments by pulling in data from various sources like news websites, military analysis reports, and social media. By browsing the web, it can collect recent articles and public reports, which it then condenses into a clear, pragmatic SITREP.

2. **Focus on Specific Topics**: With specific prompts, you can direct GPT-4 to focus on key military aspects like troop movements, strategic shifts, geopolitical tensions, and even specific conflicts. It can identify patterns and trends in the data it retrieves, making it suitable for generating reports from a focused, analytical perspective.

3. **Recurring Updates**: You can prompt GPT-4 to deliver these SITREPs every 12 hours, ensuring you stay updated on recent developments.

### Limitations:

- **Data Freshness**: GPT-4 can only retrieve publicly available and indexed data. It might not capture **real-time information** that is highly sensitive or not covered in public news sources. This can lead to delays in providing updates on rapidly changing situations.
  
- **Depth of Military Analysis**: While GPT-4 is excellent at summarizing available information, it doesn't inherently have specialized military knowledge. It can generate practical summaries based on existing data, but it might lack the deep strategic insights that a military analyst or dedicated military intelligence system could provide.

- **Bias and Source Reliability**: GPT-4 relies on the sources it pulls from, which may vary in credibility or bias. This could affect the neutrality of your SITREP unless curated through verified, high-quality sources.

### Near-Term Possibilities:

1. **Improved Real-Time Access**: Tools combining LLMs with real-time data streams (such as through APIs from defense-related news agencies or governmental databases) are on the horizon. This would allow for more **timely, precise, and focused military situational reporting**.

2. **Automated Data Integration**: As LLMs become more sophisticated, the ability to autonomously access multiple data feeds (from public, private, and military sources) and synthesize them into reports will improve. This would make SITREPs generated by AI even more accurate and useful.

### Conclusion:
We’re **close to the capability** you’re describing with GPT-4 combined with web browsing, but it currently requires external tools and careful configuration. For now, it can help you generate **useful summaries** and recurring updates, but the next steps will involve better real-time integration and more specialized analysis feeds.
