*Note: this repository consists of the outputs of large language models (LLMs). In many cases, these are unedited or minimally edited. The information provided is for demonstrative purposes only and is intended to highlight constraints and capabilities in LLM applications and prompt engineering strategies.*


# Prompt
I have a growing Obsidian vault containing LLM agent configurations, outputs, and prompts. Does it make sense to try to categorise them into subfolders by grouping them like that? Is there a better organisational approach? If the subfolder idea is the best, can you think of any scripts I might be able to deploy that could do some of the classification work programatically?

# Output
Organizing your Obsidian vault by categorizing LLM agent configurations, outputs, and prompts into subfolders is a logical and structured approach. However, whether this is the best method depends on how you access and use the information. Here are some considerations and alternative approaches:

### **1. Subfolder Organization:**
   - **Grouping by Type**: Create subfolders like `Configurations`, `Outputs`, and `Prompts`. This is straightforward and keeps each type of content easily accessible.
   - **Grouping by Project or Use Case**: If your work involves distinct projects or use cases, organizing by project might make more sense, with each project folder containing its configurations, outputs, and prompts.

### **2. Tagging System:**
   - **Description**: Instead of or in addition to subfolders, you can use tags in Obsidian to categorize your content. Tags allow for cross-referencing, making it easier to find related content across different projects or types.
   - **How to Use**: Tags like `#config`, `#output`, `#prompt`, or project-specific tags can be used across your vault. You can then use Obsidianâ€™s search and filtering capabilities to quickly locate related content.

### **3. Metadata and Dataview:**
   - **Description**: Utilize metadata fields (YAML frontmatter) and the Dataview plugin to create dynamic views of your content.
   - **How to Use**: Add metadata to each note indicating its type, project, or any other relevant categories. Use Dataview to create queries that dynamically group and display your content based on this metadata.

### **4. Hybrid Approach:**
   - **Description**: Combine subfolders with tagging and metadata. Subfolders can hold broad categories, while tags and metadata provide more granular filtering and cross-referencing.

### **Automating Classification:**
   If you decide to go with subfolders or another structured approach, here are some ways to automate the classification process:

### **1. Bash Script for Classification:**
   - **Description**: A simple bash script can move files into the correct subfolders based on keywords in the file name or content.
   - **Example Script**:
     ```bash
     #!/bin/bash

     # Define directories
     CONFIG_DIR="Configurations"
     OUTPUT_DIR="Outputs"
     PROMPT_DIR="Prompts"

     # Create directories if they don't exist
     mkdir -p "$CONFIG_DIR" "$OUTPUT_DIR" "$PROMPT_DIR"

     # Move files based on keywords
     for file in *.md; do
         if grep -q "config" "$file"; then
             mv "$file" "$CONFIG_DIR"
         elif grep -q "output" "$file"; then
             mv "$file" "$OUTPUT_DIR"
         elif grep -q "prompt" "$file"; then
             mv "$file" "$PROMPT_DIR"
         fi
     done
     ```

### **2. Python Script with Natural Language Processing (NLP):**
   - **Description**: Use a Python script to classify files based on content, utilizing basic NLP techniques to determine the category of each note.
   - **Example Script**:
     ```python
     import os
     import shutil
     from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
     from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB

     # Define directories
     config_dir = "Configurations"
     output_dir = "Outputs"
     prompt_dir = "Prompts"

     # Create directories if they don't exist
     os.makedirs(config_dir, exist_ok=True)
     os.makedirs(output_dir, exist_ok=True)
     os.makedirs(prompt_dir, exist_ok=True)

     # Sample data and labels for training
     training_data = [
         ("This is a configuration file", "config"),
         ("This is an output of the model", "output"),
         ("This is a prompt used for the model", "prompt")
     ]
     texts, labels = zip(*training_data)

     # Vectorize the text data
     vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
     X_train = vectorizer.fit_transform(texts)

     # Train a simple classifier
     clf = MultinomialNB()
     clf.fit(X_train, labels)

     # Classify and move files
     for file in os.listdir("."):
         if file.endswith(".md"):
             with open(file, 'r') as f:
                 content = f.read()
             X_test = vectorizer.transform([content])
             prediction = clf.predict(X_test)[0]

             if prediction == "config":
                 shutil.move(file, config_dir)
             elif prediction == "output":
                 shutil.move(file, output_dir)
             elif prediction == "prompt":
                 shutil.move(file, prompt_dir)
     ```

### **3. Use of Obsidian Plugins:**
   - **Description**: Some Obsidian plugins might assist in automatically organizing content based on metadata or content patterns. Plugins like `Templater` or `MetaEdit` can help automate the process based on predefined rules.

### **Recommendation:**
   - **If your content is clearly distinct** (i.e., configurations, outputs, prompts are easy to distinguish), subfolders with an additional tagging or metadata system will likely be the best approach.
   - **If the boundaries are less clear** or you anticipate a lot of cross-referencing, a hybrid approach using tags, metadata, and Dataview might offer more flexibility and ease of use.

By combining automated scripts with a well-thought-out organizational structure, you can efficiently manage and retrieve your growing collection of LLM-related content in Obsidian.## Extracted Prompts
