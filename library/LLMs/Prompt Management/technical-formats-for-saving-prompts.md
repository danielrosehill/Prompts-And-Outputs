# Prompt

Nice work. What about technical formats. Best to save it as a JSON, markdown, both, something else?

# Output

It depends on how you plan to use and retrieve your prompts. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the advantages of each format:

### **Markdown**: 
- **Advantages**:
  - Readable and easy to modify.
  - Great for human interaction and organizing prompts in a text editor or document-based system.
  - Works well with many documentation tools like GitHub, Notion, etc.

  **Example**:
  ```markdown
  ## Small Business Management Tool Recommendations
  
  **Category**: Business Tools, SaaS Solutions
  
  **Use Case**: Request for business management software with specific features and requirements for a consultant.
  
  **Core Prompt**:  
  "I'm looking for a tool to help me manage my small business. ... *[remaining text]*"
  
  **Special Instructions**:  
  Exclude certain tools. Focus on SaaS solutions under $100/month.
  
  **Notes**:  
  Can be modified to ask for other business models (e.g., inventory-based, product-based).
  ```

### **JSON**: 
- **Advantages**:
  - Best for structured data storage and programmatic retrieval.
  - Easily parsed by software, useful if you're using databases or automating prompt handling.
  - Can integrate with code-based systems (e.g., for AI models or automation tools).

  **Example**:
  ```json
  {
    "title": "Small Business Management Tool Recommendations",
    "category": "Business Tools, SaaS Solutions",
    "use_case": "Request for business management software with specific features and requirements for a consultant.",
    "core_prompt": "I'm looking for a tool to help me manage my small business. ... *[remaining text]*",
    "special_instructions": "Exclude certain tools (Zoho, Odoo, Indian companies). Focus on SaaS solutions under $100/month.",
    "notes": "Can be modified to ask for other business models (e.g., inventory-based, product-based)."
  }
  ```

### **Both**:
- **Advantages**:
  - You get the best of both worlds: human readability from Markdown and structured data from JSON.
  - You can maintain the Markdown for documentation and export the JSON when programmatic access is needed.

If you're primarily using these prompts for manual reference or light automation, **Markdown** works well. If you're integrating these into more complex systems or automations (like NoCodeDB, Airtable, etc.), **JSON** will be more efficient.

If unsure, storing both formats ensures flexibility down the road!
