Fully autonomous code generation tools capable of understanding a tech definition from the user and producing compliant Python code are still a work in progress. While there are already code generation tools available that can assist in creating code based on user input, complete autonomy would require sophisticated artificial intelligence and natural language processing capabilities.

Some companies are working on advancing code generation technologies, such as OpenAI and GitHub's Copilot, which can assist programmers by automatically writing code snippets based on comments and inputs. However, these tools currently do not provide fully autonomous code generation.

If such a tool were to be developed in the future, it might be called an "autonomous code generator" or something similar. It is challenging to predict an exact timeline for when fully autonomous code generation tools will become a reality, as it depends on various factors such as advancements in AI, machine learning, and software development practices.
