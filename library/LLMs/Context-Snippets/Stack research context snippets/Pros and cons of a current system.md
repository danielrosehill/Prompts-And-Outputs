Sure! Here’s a quick document summarizing your current system, the frustrations you're experiencing, and what you're looking for.

### **Current System for Storing GPT Outputs**

You are currently using a combination of **ChatGPT** and **Obsidian** to store and manage outputs generated through GPT interactions. Here's how the system works:

1. **Prompt Generation and Interaction**:
   - You use **ChatGPT’s web UI** to interact with the model, inputting prompts and receiving outputs that help with ideation, brainstorming, and knowledge gathering.

2. **Saving Outputs**:
   - After interacting with GPT, you manually save both **prompts** and **outputs** into a dedicated **Obsidian vault** on your desktop. Obsidian is a markdown-based note-taking app that allows you to categorize and organize these interactions effectively.
   - Your Obsidian vault contains key folders:
     - **Agent Configs**: Stores configuration details for specific LLM agents.
     - **Prompts**: A collection of saved prompts.
     - **Outputs**: Stores the generated content from GPT.
     - **Context Snippets**: Stores various contextual data used to enhance prompts.

3. **Sync and Backup**:
   - The entire vault is synced to **Backblaze B2**, which acts as your primary backup system. This ensures that your data is safely stored and can be accessed from multiple devices.

### **Current Frustrations with the System**

While the system works well for generating and storing content, several pain points have emerged, especially related to mobile access and scaling:

1. **Obsidian’s Android App**:
   - The **Obsidian Android app** is not ideal for browsing through the large collection of GPT-generated outputs. The app’s user interface is clunky when it comes to reading through the markdown files, especially for reviewing long or complex notes.
   - The app lacks smooth **pagination** and navigation features (like back/forward arrows) that would make it easy to browse and navigate through the large vault on a mobile device.

2. **Local Storage Constraints**:
   - Syncing the entire vault to a smartphone using B2 becomes impractical as the vault grows larger. Mobile hardware, with its limited storage, makes it difficult to handle the increasing size of the vault, especially when the sync process downloads everything locally.

3. **Difficulty in Reviewing Outputs**:
   - Although you are able to save valuable outputs, it’s becoming increasingly hard to **review** or **revisit** them on your smartphone due to the limitations of the Obsidian app and the local sync process.

### **What You’re Looking For**

You are seeking a more **efficient and user-friendly** way to access and navigate through your saved GPT outputs, particularly on mobile devices. Specifically:

1. **Streaming Markdown Files**:
   - Instead of syncing the entire vault locally to the phone, you're looking for a way to **stream** markdown files from your B2 backup, allowing you to access the files on demand without downloading everything. The goal is to treat B2 as a **remote-mounted volume**, ideally with **read-only access**.

2. **A Better Mobile Reading Experience**:
   - You need an app or tool on Android that would allow for **easy navigation** through the outputs, including features like **pagination** or **back/forward arrows** to browse through your markdown notes without manually searching for files.

3. **Seamless Integration with B2**:
   - You would like to keep your current B2 backup system but enhance the way markdown files are accessed on Android. A solution that directly integrates with B2 and allows for **markdown file streaming** would solve the problem of local storage constraints.
