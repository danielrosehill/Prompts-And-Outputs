Yes, there are several programs and techniques that can automatically chunk long texts, such as PDFs, to ensure that each chunk remains within the input context token limit of a specific Large Language Model (LLM). These methods are essential for working with LLMs, which have strict token limits that cannot be exceeded in a single input.

### Techniques and Tools for Chunking Long Texts

1. **Manual Chunking Based on Token Limits**
   - You can manually split the text into smaller sections based on the token limit of the LLM you are using. For example, if you are working with GPT-3.5, which has a token limit of 4,096 tokens (around 3,072 words)\[3], you would divide your text into sections that fit within this limit. However, this method can be time-consuming and error-prone.
2. **Automated Chunking Tools**
   - There are several tools and libraries available that can automatically split long texts into smaller chunks based on token limits:
     - **LangChain**: This is a popular library for working with LLMs, which includes utilities for splitting documents into chunks while respecting token limits. LangChain can integrate with models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 and automatically handle chunking based on the model's token limit.
     - **GPT-3/4 Tokenizer (tiktoken)**: OpenAI provides a tokenizer library called `tiktoken`, which can be used to calculate the number of tokens in a piece of text. You can use this to programmatically split a document into chunks that fit within the model's token limit\[5].
     - **Recursive Summarization**: For very large documents, recursive summarization techniques can be employed. This involves summarizing sections of the document until the summary fits within the token limit\[4].
3. **Programmatic Solutions**
   - You can write custom scripts to split texts based on token counts using libraries like `tiktoken` (for OpenAI models) or other similar tokenizers for different models. The script would:
     1. Tokenize the text.
     2. Count tokens in each section.
     3. Split the text into chunks that fit within the specified token limit.
   Here's an example in Python using `tiktoken`:
   ```python
   import tiktoken

   def chunk_text(text, model="gpt-3.5-turbo", max_tokens=4096):
       # Initialize tokenizer
       encoding = tiktoken.encoding_for_model(model)
       
       # Tokenize text
       tokens = encoding.encode(text)
       
       # Split tokens into chunks
       chunks = [tokens[i:i + max_tokens] for i in range(0, len(tokens), max_tokens)]
       
       # Decode tokens back to text
       return [encoding.decode(chunk) for chunk in chunks]

   # Example usage:
   long_text = "Your long document here..."
   chunks = chunk_text(long_text)
   ```
4. **Specialized PDF Processing Tools**
   - Some tools specifically designed for handling PDFs can also help split content based on LLM token limits:
     - **PDF-to-Text Converters**: Convert PDF content to plain text and then apply automated chunking based on token limits.
     - **LangChain's Document Loaders**: LangChain offers document loaders that can process PDFs and automatically chunk them before sending them to an LLM.

### Considerations When Chunking Text

- **Token Calculation**: Different models tokenize text differently, so it's important to use the correct tokenizer for your model (e.g., `tiktoken` for OpenAI models).
- **Context Preservation**: When splitting long texts, ensure that each chunk maintains enough context to be meaningful on its own. Some methods allow overlapping chunks to preserve context between sections.

### Conclusion

There are several ways to automatically chunk long texts like PDFs to fit within an LLM's token limit:

- Use libraries like LangChain or `tiktoken` for automated chunking.
- Write custom scripts to handle large documents programmatically.
- Consider specialized tools for processing PDFs.

These methods ensure that your input stays within the model's context window, allowing you to work with large documents efficiently.
