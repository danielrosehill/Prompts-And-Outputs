Running a high-performance AI setup like the one described in a residential apartment would have significant implications in terms of **space, noise, and heat**. Here’s what you can expect:

### 1. **Space Requirements**

- **Physical Size of the Computer:**
  - A typical server-grade chassis (like a **4U rack-mountable server**) for housing multiple GPUs, CPUs, and other components would take up about the size of a large desktop tower or a small server rack.
  - **Dimensions**: 
    - Height: ~18 cm (7 inches)
    - Width: ~43 cm (17 inches)
    - Depth: ~65 cm (25 inches)
  - This means the computer would be about the size of a large desktop tower or small file cabinet. Depending on the cooling setup (especially if you use custom liquid cooling), you might need additional space for radiators or external cooling units.

- **Additional Components**:
  - If you opt for **liquid cooling**, the setup might include additional external radiators or reservoirs, which could take up more space.
  - If you need **networking equipment** (e.g., routers, switches for a multi-node setup), you’ll need a small additional space for those as well.

- **Placement**: You could place the computer in a corner of the room or under a desk, but with such a powerful setup, you might need proper clearance for airflow and ventilation. The overall setup, including any external cooling systems, would take up **about the size of a medium filing cabinet**.

### 2. **Noise Levels**

- **Noise from GPUs**:
  - High-end GPUs like the **A100** or **RTX 4090** generate a lot of heat, and their fans can get loud when running at full load. **Air-cooled setups** with multiple fans could reach noise levels of **50-60 dB** (about as loud as a normal conversation or a quiet office).
  - If you're using a **liquid cooling system**, it would be quieter, but the pumps and radiators could still generate some noise, typically around **40-50 dB**.

- **Noise from PSU and Fans**:
  - The **PSU** (power supply) and chassis fans can also generate significant noise, especially under heavy load when the system needs to be cooled down aggressively.
  - Expect the total noise to reach around **60-70 dB** under full load, which is comparable to a dishwasher or vacuum cleaner but more constant.

**Mitigation**: 
  - If noise is a concern, **liquid cooling** and **acoustic dampening** cases can help reduce sound levels. You could also consider placing the setup in a room you don’t spend a lot of time in to avoid disturbance.

### 3. **Heat Output**

Running this setup will generate a **significant amount of heat**, especially from the GPUs, which will be operating under heavy load.

- **Heat from GPUs**:
  - Each **A100** GPU or **RTX 4090** can output **300-500W** of heat. In total, with multiple GPUs running at full capacity, you could expect the system to generate around **1,000-1,500W** of heat, similar to running a space heater at full power.
  
- **Ambient Temperature Rise**:
  - In a small, 50 square meter apartment, this amount of heat can cause a noticeable rise in temperature. Over time, especially without good ventilation, the room could heat up by **5-10°C** (9-18°F), depending on the room’s airflow and external conditions.
  - In summer, without air conditioning, this might make the room uncomfortably warm.

**Mitigation**:
  - Proper ventilation is key. You might need to run **air conditioning** to manage the heat output and keep the room at a reasonable temperature.
  - Consider placing the setup near a window with good airflow or using exhaust fans to dissipate the heat outside the room.

### Conclusion

**Space**: The computer setup would take up the size of a **medium filing cabinet** (or a large desktop tower), especially if you include external cooling components. You can fit it in a corner or under a desk, but you'll need space for proper ventilation.

**Noise**: Expect **50-70 dB** of noise under full load, comparable to a quiet dishwasher or vacuum cleaner. **Liquid cooling** can help reduce noise, but it won't be silent.

**Heat**: The system will generate a **significant amount of heat** (1,000-1,500W), potentially raising the room temperature by **5-10°C**. You will likely need **air conditioning** or proper ventilation to manage the heat in a 50 square meter apartment.

If you’re planning to run this setup in your apartment, careful placement (preferably near a window or in a dedicated room) and noise management strategies will be crucial to maintaining comfort. Let me know if you need advice on mitigating these factors!
