# Prompt

I'd be interested in learning more about fine tuned LLM models. In this Human Eval comparison paper we can see a lot of what look liked fine tuned variants of GPT-4. How significantly can these vary from the base models?

# Output

Based on the information provided in the image and the additional context from the search results, I can offer some insights on fine-tuned LLM models and their performance compared to base models:

1. Performance Improvements:
The research paper mentioned in the search results (result [5]) indicates that fine-tuned models can significantly outperform base models. Specifically, they found that "4-bit LoRA fine-tuned models outperform base models by 34 points and GPT-4 by 10 points on average" across various tasks.

2. Variety of Fine-tuned Models:
The image shows several variants of models, including "O1-mini", "O1-preview", and different versions of GPT-4, all based on seed programs from Reflexion. This suggests that there can be multiple fine-tuned versions of the same base model, each potentially optimized for different tasks or domains.

3. Significant Performance Variations:
The performance scores in the image range from 95.1 to 99.39, indicating that fine-tuned models can indeed vary significantly in their capabilities compared to base models and each other.

4. Task-Specific Improvements:
Fine-tuning often leads to improved performance on specific tasks. For example, the models in the image are evaluated on a task called "Debug like a Human," suggesting they've been optimized for debugging-related tasks.

5. Efficiency of Fine-tuning:
The search results mention techniques like LoRA (Low Rank Adaptation) and PEFT (Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning), which allow for efficient fine-tuning of large models without needing to retrain all parameters. This enables the creation of multiple specialized versions of a model relatively quickly and cost-effectively.

6. Potential to Surpass GPT-4:
The results in both the image and the research paper suggest that fine-tuned models can potentially outperform even advanced models like GPT-4 on specific tasks.

7. Variability in Results:
The image shows different scores for what appear to be variations of the same model (e.g., different GPT-4 based models), indicating that the fine-tuning process and the specific data used can lead to varying results even with the same base model.

In summary, fine-tuned LLM models can vary significantly from their base models, often showing substantial improvements in task-specific performance. The extent of variation depends on factors such as the fine-tuning technique used, the specific task or domain targeted, and the quality and quantity of the fine-tuning data.
