title: "Setting up an LLM 'teacher' that knows your learning style preference"
---

# Prompt

Let's say that I wanted to learn Python. I might find conversing with an LLM to be a very natural way to do that. But I may wish to have the LLM follow specific directions about how to "teach." What would be the easiest way for me to build a tool for myself like this?

# Output

You want to create a tool that uses a large language model (LLM) to teach Python in a way that follows specific directions or teaching styles. This can be done by building a conversational agent tailored to your preferences. Here's how you can approach it:

## Steps to Build a Custom Python Learning Tool Using an LLM

### 1. Define the Purpose and Scope

Start by clearly defining what you want the tool to achieve:

- **Personalized Learning**: Should the LLM adapt to your learning pace and style, providing feedback and adjusting difficulty?
- **Teaching Style**: Do you want a Socratic method (asking questions), step-by-step tutorials, or interactive coding challenges?
- **Content Focus**: Will the tool cover basic Python syntax, advanced topics, or specific libraries?

This step will guide the development process and ensure that the LLM's behavior aligns with your learning goals\[5]\[7].

### 2. Choose the Right Framework and Tools

To create a conversational agent using Python, you can leverage existing frameworks and libraries designed for building LLM-powered chatbots.

- **LangChain**: This is a popular framework for creating conversational agents using LLMs like OpenAI’s GPT models. It allows you to define workflows and integrate various tools like embeddings and vector stores for memory\[1].
- **ChatterBot**: A simpler option if you want to focus on rule-based responses or predefined conversations. ChatterBot is easy to set up and train with specific datasets\[2].

For example, if you're using LangChain:

```python
pip install langchain openai
```

Then, set up your API key:

```python
import os
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "your-api-key"
```

### 3. Customize the Teaching Method

Once you've chosen a framework, you can customize how the LLM interacts with you:

- **Personalized Feedback**: Use adaptive learning techniques where the chatbot adjusts its responses based on your progress. For instance, it can offer more complex challenges as you improve\[4]\[7].
- **Interactive Coding Sessions**: You can integrate coding environments like Jupyter Notebooks into the chatbot so that it can run code snippets and provide feedback on your attempts.
- **Questioning Techniques**: Implement different pedagogical roles such as acting as a *learning coach* (guiding through concepts) or *teachable companion* (asking questions to encourage critical thinking)\[7].

### 4. Train or Fine-Tune Your Model

If you want the LLM to follow specific teaching methods or use particular terminology, you may need to fine-tune it:

- **Fine-tuning** involves training the model on specific datasets that reflect your desired teaching style.
- Alternatively, you can provide example prompts that guide the LLM’s behavior without full retraining.

For instance, if you're using OpenAI's GPT models, you could fine-tune it with prompts like:

```
Q: How do I create a list in Python?
A: A list in Python is created using square brackets. For example: `my_list = [1, 2, 3]`. Would you like to try creating one yourself?
```

### 5. Implement Memory for Contextual Learning

To make the learning experience more dynamic, consider adding memory so that the LLM remembers past interactions. This allows it to track your progress and adapt accordingly.

- **Vector Stores** like Chroma or Pinecone can store conversation history and embeddings, allowing the chatbot to recall previous lessons and adjust future interactions\[1].

### 6. Test and Iterate

Once your tool is built, continuously test it by interacting with it as a learner:

- Does it follow your preferred teaching style?
- Is it providing helpful feedback?
- Are there areas where it could be more interactive or clearer?

You can also gather feedback from others if you're building this for broader use.

### 7. Keep Improving

LLMs evolve quickly, so keep an eye on new developments in AI education tools. Regularly update your system with new features such as better personalization algorithms or improved natural language understanding\[6].

## Conclusion

Creating an educational tool powered by an LLM is feasible with frameworks like LangChain or ChatterBot. By defining clear goals (e.g., personalized learning paths), selecting appropriate technologies, and customizing the interaction style, you can build a Python tutor tailored to your specific needs.
