Here’s a table that provides examples of what types of text can fit within different token limits, based on the average conversion rate of 1 token ≈ 4 characters or 1 token ≈ 0.75 words. The examples range from short stories to entire novels, reports, and other types of documents:

| **Token Limit**    | **Max Words**  | **Max Characters**   | **Example Text Type**                                                                                      |
| ------------------ | -------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1,000 tokens**   | \~750 words    | \~4,000 characters   | A short essay, blog post, or a chapter from a children's book (e.g., a chapter from *Winnie the Pooh*)\[3] |
| **4,096 tokens**   | \~3,000 words  | \~16,000 characters  | A long-form article, research paper, or a short story (e.g., *The Great Gatsby* is about 47,094 words)\[1] |
| **8,192 tokens**   | \~6,000 words  | \~32,000 characters  | A novella or long report (e.g., *The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe* at 38,421 words)\[1]                |
| **16,384 tokens**  | \~12,000 words | \~64,000 characters  | A short novel or detailed report (e.g., *The Hobbit* at 95,356 words)\[1]                                  |
| **32,768 tokens**  | \~24,000 words | \~128,000 characters | A medium-length novel or a lengthy academic thesis (e.g., *To Kill a Mockingbird* at 100,388 words)\[1]    |
| **64,000 tokens**  | \~48,000 words | \~256,000 characters | A long novel (e.g., *A Clash of Kings* by George R.R. Martin at 326,000 words)\[1]                         |
| **128,000 tokens** | \~96,000 words | \~512,000 characters | An epic novel or multiple books (e.g., *War and Peace* by Leo Tolstoy at 561,304 words)\[1]\[2]            |

### Explanation:

- **Shorter Texts (up to 4K tokens)**: These limits are suitable for shorter works such as essays or articles. For example:
  - A blog post of around 750 words fits comfortably within a 1K token limit.
  - A short story like *The Great Gatsby* (\~47K words) would require around 4K tokens.
- **Medium-Length Texts (8K - 32K tokens)**: These limits can handle novellas or detailed reports. For instance:
  - *The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe* (\~38K words) fits within an 8K token window.
  - Novels like *The Hobbit* (\~95K words) can be processed with around 16K tokens.
- **Longer Texts (32K - 128K tokens)**: These larger limits are ideal for processing entire novels or even multiple books. For example:
  - With a limit of around 32K tokens (\~24K words), you could input a novel like *To Kill a Mockingbird*.
  - At the upper end (128K tokens), you could input very large works like *War and Peace*, which is over half a million words.

These examples should give you a clearer idea of what kinds of texts can fit within various token limits in large language models.
