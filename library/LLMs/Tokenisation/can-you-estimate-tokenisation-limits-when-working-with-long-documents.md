# Prompt

Is there any reliable way of calculating where the token limits might fall within a sample document? Let's say that I wanted to use a PDF with GPT 4o Turbo. I might want to know exactly where the token limit "hits" in the text so to speak. Are there any reliable tools for estimating this?

# Output

Yes, there are reliable ways to estimate where token limits might fall within a document, especially if you're working with PDFs or text that needs to be processed by GPT models like GPT-4 Turbo. Here’s how you can estimate token usage and determine where the token limit will hit:

### 1. **Use OpenAI's Tokenizer Tool**:
   OpenAI provides a [Tokenizer tool](https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer) that allows you to copy and paste text into a browser interface. The tool will tell you how many tokens the text uses, making it easy to identify how much text can fit within a given token limit. To use this:

   - Copy and paste portions of your document into the Tokenizer tool.
   - It will give you the exact number of tokens the pasted text takes up.
   - You can keep splitting and pasting the text until you reach the token limit (e.g., 128,000 tokens for GPT-4 Turbo).

   **Steps**:
   - Upload the text from the PDF into the tool.
   - Look for where the token count approaches your desired limit (e.g., 128,000 tokens).
   - Split the document accordingly.

### 2. **Use Python Libraries to Count Tokens**:
   You can automate this process using Python libraries such as `tiktoken`, the tokenizer used by OpenAI. With this, you can programmatically count tokens in a given document (including PDFs). This method can give you an exact idea of how many tokens a given block of text or document will consume.

   **Example Code**:
   ```python
   import tiktoken

   # Load the encoding for GPT-4 Turbo
   enc = tiktoken.encoding_for_model("gpt-4-turbo")

   # Open the document and read the content
   with open("your_document.txt", "r", encoding="utf-8") as file:
       document_text = file.read()

   # Encode the document to calculate tokens
   tokens = enc.encode(document_text)

   # Print the number of tokens
   print(f"Total tokens: {len(tokens)}")
   
   # Optionally, chunk the text based on token limits (e.g., 8000 tokens)
   chunk_size = 8000
   for i in range(0, len(tokens), chunk_size):
       chunk = tokens[i:i+chunk_size]
       print(f"Chunk {i//chunk_size + 1}: {len(chunk)} tokens")
   ```

   You can adjust the chunk size (e.g., 128,000 for GPT-4 Turbo) to see exactly where token limits would hit and how to break the document up.

### 3. **Convert PDFs to Text and Measure Tokens**:
   If your document is in PDF format, you’ll need to convert it to plain text first. Once converted, you can apply the above methods to calculate the token count:

   - **Use a PDF to text converter**: Tools like `PyPDF2` or `pdfplumber` can extract text from PDFs. Once extracted, you can feed this text into a tokenizer tool (like `tiktoken`) to calculate token usage.

   **Example for PDF Extraction**:
   ```python
   import PyPDF2
   import tiktoken

   # Initialize tokenizer
   enc = tiktoken.encoding_for_model("gpt-4-turbo")

   # Extract text from PDF
   with open("your_document.pdf", "rb") as file:
       reader = PyPDF2.PdfReader(file)
       document_text = ""
       for page in reader.pages:
           document_text += page.extract_text()

   # Encode the text to calculate tokens
   tokens = enc.encode(document_text)
   print(f"Total tokens: {len(tokens)}")
   ```

### 4. **Estimate Based on Word Counts**:
   A rough rule of thumb for tokenization is:
   - **1 token ≈ 4 characters** of English text.
   - **1 token ≈ 0.75 words**.

   For example:
   - 1,000 tokens ≈ 750 words.
   - 8,000 tokens ≈ 6,000 words.

   You can use word count as a rough estimation, then split your document accordingly. However, this approach can be inaccurate because tokens don’t directly correspond to words in all languages or contexts.

### 5. **Tools like LangChain**:
   LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models and includes utilities for token management. You can use it to split large texts into smaller chunks based on token limits. LangChain’s token handling can be customized to split at logical breaks (e.g., paragraphs or sentences), helping you to prepare a long document for use in models like GPT-4 Turbo.

   **Example for Text Chunking in LangChain**:
   ```python
   from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter

   # Initialize text splitter
   text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=8000, chunk_overlap=200)

   # Split document into chunks
   chunks = text_splitter.split_text(document_text)

   # Print the first chunk
   print(chunks[0])
   ```

   This method allows you to chunk text automatically, ensuring each part stays within token limits.

### 6. **Using OpenAI API**:
   If you are interacting with GPT through the API, you can track token usage during the requests. The API will return the number of tokens used in each request, so you can monitor how many tokens your inputs consume in real-time.

By using these tools, you can accurately estimate and manage token usage when working with long documents, ensuring that your inputs stay within the limits of the model’s capabilities.
