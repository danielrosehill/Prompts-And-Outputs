You are looking for local large language models (LLMs) that can run on your hardware and support an unusually large input context window. Based on your system specifications, which include an Intel Core i7-12700F CPU, 64GB of RAM, and an AMD Radeon RX 7700 XT GPU, you have a capable setup for running mid-sized LLMs locally.

Here are some LLMs that would fit your requirements:

## 1. LLaMA-3-8B

- **Context Window**: 8,192 tokens
- **Model Size**: 8 billion parameters
- **Why it fits**: LLaMA models are optimized for running on consumer hardware and have good performance with relatively large context windows. The 8B version should run smoothly on your hardware given the available RAM and GPU power.
- **Use Case**: General-purpose tasks, coding assistance, and summarization\[2]\[6].

## 2. XGen-7B-8K

- **Context Window**: 8,000 tokens
- **Model Size**: 7 billion parameters
- **Why it fits**: XGen is designed to handle longer context windows efficiently while maintaining a smaller parameter count. This makes it suitable for tasks requiring long input sequences without overwhelming your hardware\[3].
- **Use Case**: Suitable for longer text processing tasks like summarization or document analysis.

## 3. Mistral 7B

- **Context Window**: Up to 32,000 tokens (depending on variant)
- **Model Size**: 7 billion parameters
- **Why it fits**: Mistral models are known for their efficiency in handling long context windows while maintaining high performance. The smaller size compared to larger models like Falcon or LLaMA allows it to run well on mid-range hardware like yours\[4]\[5].
- **Use Case**: Ideal for long-context reasoning tasks such as summarizing or analyzing large documents.

## 4. Falcon 40B (Quantized)

- **Context Window**: Up to 32,000 tokens
- **Model Size**: 40 billion parameters (can be quantized to reduce memory usage)
- **Why it fits**: Falcon models are powerful open-source LLMs that support long context windows. By quantizing the model, you can reduce its memory footprint, making it feasible to run on your hardware\[3].
- **Use Case**: Complex NLP tasks requiring extensive context, such as legal document analysis or scientific research.

## 5. Nous-Capybara 34B

- **Context Window**: Up to 200,000 tokens
- **Model Size**: 34 billion parameters (can be quantized)
- **Why it fits**: This model is designed specifically for handling extremely long contexts, making it ideal if you need to process very large inputs. Quantization will help make it runnable on your system\[6].
- **Use Case**: Tasks involving massive inputs like book summarization or large-scale data analysis.

### Tools for Running Local LLMs:

To run these models locally, you can use tools such as:

1. **Ollama** – A user-friendly tool that supports many models like LLaMA and Falcon\[4].
2. **LM Studio** – A desktop app that allows you to easily download and run local LLMs\[4].
3. **Llama.cpp** – A lightweight framework for running LLaMA-based models efficiently on consumer hardware\[4].

### Conclusion:

Given your hardware setup, models like LLaMA-3-8B, XGen-7B, and Mistral 7B should run efficiently while providing the longer context windows you need. For even larger contexts, consider quantizing bigger models like Nous-Capybara or Falcon to fit within your system's constraints.
