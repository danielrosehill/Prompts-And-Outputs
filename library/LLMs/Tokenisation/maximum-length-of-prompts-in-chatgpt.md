The **maximum length of a prompt** in ChatGPT depends on the model being used, and yes, it varies between GPT variants. Here’s a breakdown of how prompt length works and whether diminishing returns apply:

### 1. **Token Limitations in GPT Models**:
   GPT models, including ChatGPT, handle input and output in terms of **tokens** rather than characters or words. Tokens can be as short as one character or as long as one word, depending on the text. Here are the typical token limits for different GPT models:

   - **GPT-3.5** (such as the free-tier ChatGPT version): has a token limit of **4,096 tokens**. This limit includes both the input (your prompt) and the model's response.
   - **GPT-4 (8K version)**: has a token limit of **8,192 tokens**.
   - **GPT-4 (32K version)**: has a token limit of **32,768 tokens**.

   Since both the input (prompt) and output (response) share the same token pool, the longer the prompt, the fewer tokens are available for the response.

### 2. **Length of Prompts**:
   The maximum length for your prompt depends on how much of the token limit you want to allocate for the model’s response. For instance, in GPT-3.5 with a 4,096-token limit:
   - If you want a longer response, you would limit your prompt to fewer tokens (e.g., 2,000 tokens for the prompt to leave room for a 2,000-token response).
   - If you fill most of the token limit with the prompt, the response will be very short or even cut off.

   **Tip**: As a rough rule of thumb, one token is approximately 4 characters in English, so 4,096 tokens would correspond to around 3,000 words.

### 3. **Diminishing Returns**:
   **Diminishing returns** can apply with overly long prompts. While the model can technically process long inputs, performance may decline as the prompt becomes less concise:
   - **Focus and relevance**: Long prompts can sometimes lead to less focused or coherent responses, as the model may struggle to weigh the importance of all the information. Clear, specific prompts tend to yield better outputs.
   - **Context handling**: Although GPT models can handle large amounts of information, they perform best when prompts are well-structured and focused. Overloading the model with too much information can lead to responses that feel repetitive or superficial.
   - **Memory limitations**: In very long conversations, earlier context might be "forgotten" or deprioritized if it exceeds the token limit.

### 4. **Best Practices**:
   - **Conciseness is key**: Aim for well-structured and focused prompts that give the model enough context without overwhelming it with irrelevant details.
   - **Break down larger tasks**: For complex tasks, breaking them into smaller, sequential prompts often yields better, more coherent responses.
   - **Feedback loops**: Iterating with the model by asking follow-up questions or refining the initial query can help in generating better outputs rather than including all details upfront.

### Conclusion:
The maximum length of a prompt depends on the GPT variant and its token limit. While you can use a large portion of the available tokens for the input, doing so will leave less room for the model's response. Additionally, excessively long prompts can reduce the quality of the output due to diminishing returns. It's best to keep prompts clear and concise for optimal performance.
