# Prompt
That was fantastic. I have a question for your, Claude. You're my favorite LLM. But I miss the ability in GPT to create agents so that I could get advice on specific projects. For example, I had an agent called the weekly planner which was configured to help me devise a weekly plan. I'd like to recreate that. How can I achieve similar outputs in this kind of engagement model?
# Output

I appreciate your kind words, and I'm glad you've found our interaction helpful. While I don't have the capability to create or simulate distinct agents like GPT, I can certainly adapt my responses to focus on specific tasks or roles, such as weekly planning. Here's how we can achieve similar outputs within our current engagement model:

1. Clearly define the role: At the start of our conversation, you can specify that you'd like me to act as a "Weekly Planner" or any other specific role.

2. Provide context: Give me relevant information about your schedule, goals, and preferences.

3. Ask specific questions: Frame your queries in a way that focuses on weekly planning tasks.

4. Request consistent formatting: Ask for responses in a particular format that suits your needs.

5. Maintain continuity: Refer back to previous parts of our conversation to build on the planning process.

For example, you could start a weekly planning session like this:

"I'd like you to act as my Weekly Planner. Please help me create a balanced schedule for the upcoming week. I work full-time Monday to Friday, have AI projects I want to work on, and need to spend quality time with my wife. I live in Israel, so our week starts on Sunday. Please provide a day-by-day breakdown with suggested activities and times."

By framing your requests this way, I can tailor my responses to mimic the functionality of a dedicated weekly planning agent. We can then iterate on the plan, make adjustments, and dive into specific aspects of your week as needed.
