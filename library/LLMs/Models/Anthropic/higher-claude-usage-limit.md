# Prompt

As you may have noticed, I am an intensive user of Claude! I would love to keep running prompts & outputs but I frequently run into the usage limits. Are there any ways to access this model on a more usage-intensive basis? perhaps through the API or some other method? As you know, I am concerned with storing the outputs for later retrieval and much of my prompting is related to my job - so being able to scale past this constraint would be helpful

# Output

I appreciate your enthusiasm for using Claude! Unfortunately, I don't have specific information about Anthropic's pricing plans, API access, or usage limits beyond what is publicly available. As an AI assistant, I don't have insider knowledge about Anthropic's business operations or future plans.

For the most up-to-date and accurate information on accessing Claude for more intensive usage, I'd recommend checking Anthropic's official website or contacting their sales team directly. They would be best equipped to advise you on options for higher usage limits, API access, or enterprise solutions that might fit your professional needs.

Regarding your concern about storing outputs, it's worth noting that many enterprise AI solutions offer features for logging and retrieving conversation history. However, I can't confirm if such features are available for Claude specifically.

If you're using Claude for work-related tasks, you might also want to explore whether your employer has or could obtain an enterprise license that would allow for higher usage limits and potentially address your data storage needs.

Remember, while I strive for accuracy, my knowledge about Anthropic's offerings may not be current, so it's always best to verify with official sources. Is there anything else I can assist you with regarding your use of AI tools for your work?
