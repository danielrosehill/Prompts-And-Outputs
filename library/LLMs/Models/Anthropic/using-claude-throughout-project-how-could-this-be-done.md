# Prompt

I'd love to begin working on my Output Hub redesign as we've specced it out so far. However, I'm using Claude via Perplexity AI and if I loose this chat all the context will be lost. I would love to find a way to use Claude to guide me through the whole project without having that worry. Do you have any ideas for how I might do this?

# Output

Given your situation of using Claude via Perplexity AI and wanting to maintain context throughout your Output Hub redesign project, here are some suggestions to help you preserve the conversation and guidance:

1. Export or Save Conversations:
   Check if Perplexity AI offers any options to export or save your conversations. Some AI platforms allow you to download chat logs or transcripts.

2. Manual Logging:
   After each significant part of the conversation, copy and paste the key points, specifications, and instructions into a separate document. This could be a text file, Google Doc, or even a note in your Obsidian vault.

3. Project Documentation:
   Create a dedicated project document where you summarize the key decisions, specifications, and steps outlined so far. Update this document regularly as you progress through the project with Claude's guidance.

4. Use a Version Control System:
   Consider using a Git repository to store your project documentation and code. This allows you to track changes over time and revert if needed.

5. Incremental Development:
   Break down the project into smaller, manageable tasks. After completing each task, document the process and outcomes. This way, even if you lose the conversation, you have a record of your progress.

6. Regular Recaps:
   At the beginning of each new session with Claude, provide a brief recap of where you left off. This helps maintain context and allows Claude to provide consistent advice.

7. Structured Q&A Sessions:
   Instead of having long, continuous conversations, structure your interactions with Claude into specific Q&A sessions focused on particular aspects of the project. Document each session separately.

8. Use Project Management Tools:
   Consider using tools like Trello or Notion to create boards or pages that outline the project structure, tasks, and Claude's advice. Update these as you progress.

9. Periodic Summaries:
   Ask Claude to provide periodic summaries of the project's current state, key decisions, and next steps. Save these summaries in your project documentation.

10. Local AI Assistants:
    If possible, consider using a local AI assistant or a different platform that allows for longer context retention or conversation saving.

Remember, while these methods can help preserve context and guidance, they also require consistent effort on your part to document and organize the information. Choose the methods that best fit your workflow and project needs.
