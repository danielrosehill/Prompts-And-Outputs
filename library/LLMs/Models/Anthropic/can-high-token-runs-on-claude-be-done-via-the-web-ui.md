Yes, Claude 3’s **100,000-token limit** is available through both the **API** and the **web UI**. Initially, the extended context window was only accessible via the API, but it has since been made available in the **web UI** as well, allowing users to leverage the full token capacity in a browser environment. This makes it particularly useful for analyzing long documents or engaging in extended conversations directly on the web platform, without needing API integration.

If you are using **Claude Pro** on the web interface, you should have access to this larger token window, making it possible to input up to 100K tokens (roughly equivalent to 75–100 pages of text)
