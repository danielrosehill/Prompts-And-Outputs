# Prompt
ChatGPT pointed me in the direction of a couple of extensions but I'm a bit dissuaded by the poor reviews they get. Situation: I love adding markdown docs to my repos. Sometimes for jotting down notes for myself. And in other instances for adding documentation to the repo itself. Sometimes (naturally) I'll include images. The problem: The paths are fixed and sometimes (esp as the repo grows) I need to do some reorganising of the file structure. I might start out with a very basic structure like: `/images/1.png` But after a while might want to switch to something slightly more elaborate like `/images/home/1.png` Of course, it's possible to do find and replace operations but I would love to have this happen automatically. Can anyone recommend an extension for this purpose? Thank you!

# Output
Thank you for sharing your situation and the challenge you're facing with managing image paths in Markdown documents within your repositories. While I can't directly recommend specific extensions due to my knowledge cutoff and inability to browse current extensions, I can suggest a few approaches that might help address your issue:

1. Relative paths:
   Instead of using absolute paths from the root of your repository, consider using relative paths in your Markdown files. This way, if you move both the Markdown file and its associated images together, the links won't break.

   For example:
   ```markdown
   ![Image](./images/1.png)
   ```

2. Script-based solution:
   You could create a simple script (in Python, Bash, or any language you're comfortable with) that updates the image paths in your Markdown files when you reorganize your directory structure. This script could be run manually or integrated into your development workflow.

3. Git hooks:
   Implement a pre-commit or post-commit Git hook that checks for broken image links and either warns you or automatically updates them based on the new file structure.

4. Custom VSCode extension:
   If you're comfortable with JavaScript/TypeScript, you could create a custom VSCode extension that handles this specific use case. This would give you full control over the functionality and behavior.

5. Symbolic links:
   In some cases, you might consider using symbolic links in your repository to maintain backwards compatibility with old paths while allowing for a new directory structure.

6. Documentation as code tools:
   Consider using documentation-as-code tools like MkDocs, Sphinx, or Jekyll, which often have built-in features or plugins to handle asset management more robustly.

If you'd like me to elaborate on any of these approaches or discuss how to implement them, please let me know. Additionally, if you have a specific programming language or tool you prefer working with, I can provide more targeted suggestions.

# Input

The problem is that I frequently won't move the markdown and images together. I may wish to keep the markdown file in place and just move the images.

# Output

I see, thank you for clarifying that. You're right that this adds complexity to the problem, as the relative paths approach I suggested earlier wouldn't solve it. Let's consider some alternative approaches that might work better for your specific situation:

1. Centralized image repository:
   Instead of scattering images throughout your project, you could maintain a centralized image repository. This way, even if you reorganize your markdown files, the image paths remain constant.

   

   ```python
import os
   import shutil
   import hashlib

   def hash_file(filename):
       """Generate a hash for the file content."""
       h = hashlib.sha256()
       with open(filename, 'rb') as file:
           chunk = 0
           while chunk != b'':
               chunk = file.read(1024)
               h.update(chunk)
       return h.hexdigest()

   def manage_images(source_dir, target_dir):
       """Move images to a centralized directory and return a mapping of old to new paths."""
       path_mapping = {}
       
       for root, _, files in os.walk(source_dir):
           for file in files:
               if file.lower().endswith(('.png', '.jpg', '.jpeg', '.gif')):
                   source_path = os.path.join(root, file)
                   file_hash = hash_file(source_path)
                   extension = os.path.splitext(file)[1]
                   new_filename = f"{file_hash}{extension}"
                   target_path = os.path.join(target_dir, new_filename)
                   
                   if not os.path.exists(target_path):
                       shutil.copy2(source_path, target_path)
                   
                   rel_source_path = os.path.relpath(source_path, source_dir)
                   rel_target_path = os.path.relpath(target_path, source_dir)
                   path_mapping[rel_source_path] = rel_target_path
       
       return path_mapping

   def update_markdown_files(directory, path_mapping):
       """Update image paths in markdown files."""
       for root, _, files in os.walk(directory):
           for file in files:
               if file.endswith('.md'):
                   filepath = os.path.join(root, file)
                   with open(filepath, 'r') as f:
                       content = f.read()
                   
                   for old_path, new_path in path_mapping.items():
                       content = content.replace(old_path, new_path)
                   
                   with open(filepath, 'w') as f:
                       f.write(content)

   # Example usage
   if __name__ == "__main__":
       source_directory = "./project"
       image_directory = "./project/centralized_images"
       os.makedirs(image_directory, exist_ok=True)
       
       path_mapping = manage_images(source_directory, image_directory)
       update_markdown_files(source_directory, path_mapping)
   
```

   This script does the following:
   - Moves all images to a centralized directory
   - Renames images based on their content hash to avoid duplicates
   - Updates all markdown files with the new image paths

   You could run this script whenever you reorganize your project structure.

2. Database-backed image management:
   For a more robust solution, you could create a small database (even a simple SQLite database would work) to keep track of image locations. Your markdown files would reference images by a unique identifier, and a custom script or extension would resolve these identifiers to the correct paths at runtime or during a build process.

3. Custom VSCode extension:
   Building on the previous idea, you could create a VSCode extension that manages image paths for you. It could provide commands to move images and automatically update references in markdown files.

4. Git LFS (Large File Storage):
   If your images are large, consider using Git LFS. While it doesn't solve the path problem directly, it does make it easier to manage large binary files in your repository.

5. Pre-commit hook with interactive prompts:
   Implement a Git pre-commit hook that checks for image moves and prompts you to update markdown files accordingly before allowing the commit.

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these approaches? Or perhaps you'd prefer to discuss how to implement one of these solutions in more detail?

# Input

This is getting interesting. In Github, external images will display right?

# Output

Yes, that's correct. GitHub does support displaying external images in Markdown files, including in README files and other documentation within your repository. This opens up some interesting possibilities for managing your images. Let me elaborate on this:

1. GitHub Image Rendering:
   GitHub will render images from external URLs in Markdown files. This includes:
   - Images hosted on GitHub itself (in the same or different repositories)
   - Images hosted on other public image hosting services
   - Any publicly accessible image URL

2. Advantages of External Hosting:
   - Flexibility: You can move or reorganize your local directory structure without affecting the image links in your Markdown files.
   - Reduced Repository Size: If you're dealing with many or large images, keeping them out of your main repository can help manage its size.
   - Easier Sharing: Images are accessible even to those who don't have your full repository.

3. Potential Approaches:

   a. GitHub-hosted Images:
      You could store your images in a dedicated GitHub repository or in a specific branch of your current repository, then reference them using raw GitHub URLs.

      For example:
      ```markdown
      ![Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/username/repo/branch/path/to/image.png)
      ```

   b. Using GitHub Issues:
      An interesting hack is to upload images to a GitHub issue (even in a private repository), then use the provided URL in your Markdown files. These URLs are persistent even if you never publish the issue.

   c. External Image Hosting:
      You could use a service like Imgur, Cloudinary, or AWS S3 to host your images and then reference them by URL.

4. Automated Solution:

   Given this information, we could create a script that uploads images to a chosen location (like a specific GitHub repository) and updates your Markdown files accordingly. Here's a conceptual example:

   

   ```python
import os
   import base64
   import requests
   from github import Github
   
   def upload_image_to_github(image_path, repo_name, token):
       g = Github(token)
       repo = g.get_user().get_repo(repo_name)
       
       with open(image_path, "rb") as image_file:
           content = base64.b64encode(image_file.read())
   
       file_name = os.path.basename(image_path)
       branch = "main"  # or whichever branch you prefer
       
       try:
           repo.create_file(f"images/{file_name}", f"Add image {file_name}", content, branch=branch)
           return f"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/{repo.full_name}/{branch}/images/{file_name}"
       except:
           contents = repo.get_contents(f"images/{file_name}", ref=branch)
           repo.update_file(contents.path, f"Update image {file_name}", content, contents.sha, branch=branch)
           return f"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/{repo.full_name}/{branch}/images/{file_name}"

   def update_markdown_files(directory, old_path, new_url):
       for root, _, files in os.walk(directory):
           for file in files:
               if file.endswith('.md'):
                   file_path = os.path.join(root, file)
                   with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
                       content = f.read()
                   
                   # Update both relative and absolute paths
                   content = content.replace(old_path, new_url)
                   content = content.replace(os.path.abspath(old_path), new_url)
                   
                   with open(file_path, 'w') as f:
                       f.write(content)

   # Example usage
   if __name__ == "__main__":
       token = "your_github_token"
       repo_name = "your_image_repository"
       project_directory = "./your_project_directory"
       
       for root, _, files in os.walk(project_directory):
           for file in files:
               if file.lower().endswith(('.png', '.jpg', '.jpeg', '.gif')):
                   image_path = os.path.join(root, file)
                   new_url = upload_image_to_github(image_path, repo_name, token)
                   update_markdown_files(project_directory, image_path, new_url)
                   print(f"Uploaded and updated references for {file}")
   
```

   This script does the following:
   1. Walks through your project directory
   2. Uploads each image to a specified GitHub repository
   3. Updates all Markdown files, replacing local image paths with the new GitHub URLs

   To use this script, you'd need to:
   - Install the `PyGithub` library (`pip install PyGithub`)
   - Create a GitHub personal access token with appropriate permissions
   - Create a repository to host your images (or use an existing one)

   Remember to handle this token securely and not expose it in your public repository.

5. Considerations:
   - Bandwidth: If you're using external hosting, be mindful of bandwidth usage and any associated costs.
   - Persistence: Ensure your chosen hosting solution is reliable for long-term storage.
   - Privacy: Be cautious about sensitive images, as externally hosted images are typically public.
