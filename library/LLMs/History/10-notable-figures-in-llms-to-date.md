Here's a list of 10 notable figures who have significantly contributed to the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), along with brief biographies and their key contributions:

1. Yoshua Bengio
Biography: Canadian computer scientist, professor at the University of Montreal, and scientific director of the Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms.
Contribution: Pioneered deep learning research and made fundamental contributions to neural network architectures that underpin modern LLMs. His work on neural probabilistic language models laid the groundwork for subsequent developments in language modeling.

2. Geoffrey Hinton
Biography: British-Canadian cognitive psychologist and computer scientist, professor at the University of Toronto and engineering fellow at Google.
Contribution: Known as the "Godfather of AI," Hinton's work on backpropagation and deep learning has been crucial to the development of neural networks used in LLMs. His research on distributed representations and neural network training techniques has significantly influenced the field.

3. Yann LeCun
Biography: French computer scientist, professor at New York University, and Chief AI Scientist at Meta (formerly Facebook).
Contribution: Developed convolutional neural networks, which have been adapted for use in some language processing tasks. His work on deep learning and neural networks has been foundational to the development of modern AI, including LLMs.

4. Ilya Sutskever
Biography: Israeli-Canadian computer scientist, co-founder and Chief Scientist of OpenAI.
Contribution: Co-invented the transformer architecture, which is the basis for models like GPT. He has been instrumental in the development of OpenAI's language models, including GPT-3 and its successors.

5. Ashish Vaswani
Biography: Computer scientist and researcher, currently working at Google Brain.
Contribution: Lead author of the seminal paper "Attention Is All You Need," which introduced the transformer architecture. This breakthrough has been fundamental to the development of modern LLMs like BERT, GPT, and their variants.

6. Jacob Devlin
Biography: Research scientist at Google AI Language.
Contribution: Lead developer of BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), which revolutionized natural language processing and served as a foundation for many subsequent LLMs.

7. Alec Radford
Biography: Research scientist at OpenAI.
Contribution: Key contributor to the development of the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) series of models. He has been involved in the design and implementation of GPT, GPT-2, and GPT-3, which have set new benchmarks in language modeling capabilities.

8. Dario Amodei
Biography: Former research scientist at OpenAI and Google Brain, currently VP of Research at Anthropic.
Contribution: Led the development of GPT-3 at OpenAI and has been instrumental in advancing large language models. At Anthropic, he continues to work on pushing the boundaries of AI capabilities and safety.

9. Percy Liang
Biography: Professor of Computer Science at Stanford University and director of the Center for Research on Foundation Models.
Contribution: His work focuses on making AI systems more reliable and interpretable. He has made significant contributions to the understanding and improvement of large language models, particularly in areas of robustness and transparency.

10. Emily M. Bender
Biography: Professor of Linguistics at the University of Washington.
Contribution: While not directly involved in developing LLMs, Bender has been a crucial voice in critically examining these models. Her work, including the influential paper "On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots" co-authored with Timnit Gebru, has highlighted important ethical considerations and limitations of LLMs, contributing to a more nuanced understanding of these technologies.

These individuals represent a mix of pioneers in neural network research, key developers of specific LLM architectures, and critical thinkers who have shaped our understanding of these powerful technologies. Their collective work has been instrumental in bringing LLMs to their current state of capability and prominence in the field of AI.
