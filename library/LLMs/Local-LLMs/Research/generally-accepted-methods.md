You are asking how to estimate the largest machine learning model that your hardware can handle, based on the specifications you provided. The key factors for determining the maximum model size are primarily **VRAM (GPU memory)** and **RAM (system memory)**, as these dictate how much of the model's parameters and data can be loaded and processed at once.

### Your Hardware Summary:

- **CPU**: Intel Core i7-12700F (12 cores, 25MB cache)
- **RAM**: 64GB DDR5
- **GPU**: AMD Radeon RX 7700 XT (12GB VRAM)
- **Storage**: 1.1TB NVMe SSD, 2TB SSD (BTRFS)
- **OS**: OpenSUSE Tumbleweed with KDE Plasma

### Key Considerations for Model Size:

1. **Model Parameters and Precision**:
   - Modern large language models (LLMs) typically store weights in `float16` or `bfloat16` precision, meaning each parameter takes **2 bytes**.
   - For quantized models (e.g., `8-bit` or `4-bit`), memory requirements are reduced significantly. For example, an 8-bit quantized model would take about **1 byte per parameter**, and a 4-bit quantized model would take about **0.5 bytes per parameter**.
2. **VRAM Limitations**:
   - Your GPU has **12GB of VRAM**, which is crucial for running inference on large models. Typically, a **7B parameter model** can fit into 8GB VRAM using 4-bit quantization, so your GPU should comfortably handle models up to around **13B parameters** with some layers offloaded to CPU RAM\[2].
   - However, if you use higher precision or non-quantized models, the VRAM will limit you to smaller models like a **6B parameter model** in full precision (`float16`)\[2].
3. **RAM Considerations**:
   - You have **64GB of system RAM**, which is ample for offloading larger portions of the model that cannot fit into your GPU's VRAM.
   - For instance, a non-quantized model with **30B parameters** would require about **60GB of RAM** (since each parameter takes 2 bytes in `float16`). With quantization (e.g., 4-bit), this requirement could be halved or quartered\[2].

### Estimating Maximum Model Size:

| Precision | Approximate Model Size (in Parameters) | Memory Requirements |
| --------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| `float16` | \~6B parameters                        | \~12GB VRAM         |
| `8-bit`   | \~13B parameters                       | \~12GB VRAM         |
| `4-bit`   | \~30B parameters                       | \~60GB RAM          |

Given your hardware setup:

- For GPU-based inference with full precision (`float16`), you should be able to run up to a **6B parameter model** entirely on your GPU.
- With quantization (e.g., 4-bit), you could potentially run models up to around **30B parameters**, but this would require offloading significant portions of the model to system RAM.

### Benchmarking Tools:

To benchmark your system and determine the actual limits more precisely, you can use tools like:

- MLCommons' [MLPerf](https://mlcommons.org/benchmarks/) benchmarks to measure inference performance\[3].
- Hugging Face's [Model Memory Calculator](https://huggingface.co/spaces/hf-accelerate/model-memory-calculator) for estimating memory requirements based on model size\[5].

In summary, based on your hardware, you should comfortably handle models up to around **6B parameters in full precision**, and with quantization techniques, you could push this limit to around **30B parameters**, utilizing both GPU and system RAM.
