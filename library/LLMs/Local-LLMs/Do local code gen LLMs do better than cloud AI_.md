Title: "Mainstream vs. fine-tuned local LLMs for code generation"
---


## Performance Reality

**Cloud Models Still Lead**

- GPT-4 and Claude generally outperform local LLMs for code generation\[6]\[7]
- Cloud models offer superior accuracy and more sophisticated responses
- Local models can approach GPT-3.5 level but don't match GPT-4\[6]

## DeepSeek Coder V2 Specifics

**Advantages**

- The 15.7B Lite version would run well on your hardware
- Supports 338 programming languages
- Achieves 81.1% on HumanEval benchmark\[5]
- Zero cost and complete privacy

**Disadvantages**

- Still falls short of GPT-4's capabilities
- May require more prompting to get optimal results
- Limited context compared to cloud models

## Practical Recommendation

For Python code generation:

- Use cloud models (GPT-4, Claude) when accuracy is critical
- Use DeepSeek Coder V2 Lite locally when:
  - You need privacy
  - You want zero cost
  - You need offline capability
  - Quick iterations are important

The reality is that while local models like DeepSeek Coder V2 are impressive, they still don't match the sophistication of top cloud models for code generation\[7]. However, they can be very useful as complementary tools, especially when privacy or cost is a concern.
