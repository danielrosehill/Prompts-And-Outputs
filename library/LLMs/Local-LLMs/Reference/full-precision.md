In this context, **"full precision"** refers to using **32-bit floating-point numbers (FP32)** for model parameters and computations. This is the default and most precise format used in deep learning tasks. Each parameter in the model is stored as a 32-bit number, which ensures high accuracy but also requires more memory and computational power.

### Key Points about Full Precision (FP32):

- **Memory Usage**: Since each parameter is represented by 32 bits (4 bytes), models in full precision take up more memory compared to lower precision formats.
- **Accuracy**: FP32 offers the highest numerical precision, which can be important for tasks that require very accurate calculations, such as scientific computing or highly sensitive machine learning models.
- **Performance**: Using FP32 is slower and more memory-intensive than lower precision formats like FP16 or INT8. This can lead to longer training times and higher resource consumption during inference.

### Comparison with Lower Precision Formats:

- **FP16 (Half Precision)**: Uses 16 bits (2 bytes) per parameter, which reduces memory usage and speeds up computation but may introduce some loss of precision.
- **INT8/INT4 (Quantized Models)**: These formats use 8-bit or 4-bit integers, significantly reducing memory requirements and increasing speed. However, they may introduce even more approximation errors.

In your case, with a **12GB VRAM GPU**, using full precision would limit the size of the model you can run comfortably. For instance, a model with **6 billion parameters** would require roughly 12GB of VRAM in FP32. If you switch to lower precisions like FP16 or quantized formats, you could fit larger models within the same memory constraints while sacrificing some precision.

For most large language models (LLMs), **FP16** or quantized formats are preferred for inference because they offer a good balance between performance and memory efficiency without significant loss in output quality\[2]\[3].
