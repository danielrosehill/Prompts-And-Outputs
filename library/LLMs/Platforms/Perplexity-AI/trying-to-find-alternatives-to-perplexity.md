# Prompt

Perplexity AI is an interesting tool that allows you to use several LLMs in a conversational interface. I'd be interested in knowing if there are other tools like it, especially those which integrate with Claude (but ideally also GPT and Gemini). Could you provide a list of options and give me details on their pricing?
