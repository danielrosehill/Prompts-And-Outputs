# Prompt

Please create a simple GUI for my fedora computer

It's a full screen GUI divided as follows

The left 1/2 of the UI "embeds" Obsidian.

Its local path on my computer is this:

/home/daniel/AppImages/obsidian.appimage

The right 1/2 of the UI embeds Perplexity.AI

To do this, I can give you two ideas:

1) Embed Perplexity.ai directly into the app
2) Try to use my Google Chrome app

It's program is /opt/google/chrome/google-chrome
Arguments: --profile-directory=Default --app-id=xxxxxxx

That's all 

Make it as professional as possible. Output the full python needed to run the program as described

# Output

To create a full-screen GUI for your Fedora computer that embeds Obsidian on the left half and Perplexity.AI on the right half, we can use PyQt5 for the GUI framework and QWebEngineView to embed web content. Here's a professional Python script that implements the described functionality:

```python
import sys
import os
from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication, QMainWindow, QWidget, QHBoxLayout
from PyQt5.QtWebEngineWidgets import QWebEngineView
from PyQt5.QtCore import QUrl, QProcess

class MainWindow(QMainWindow):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.setWindowTitle("Obsidian & Perplexity.AI")
        self.showFullScreen()

        central_widget = QWidget()
        self.setCentralWidget(central_widget)
        layout = QHBoxLayout(central_widget)

        # Obsidian (left half)
        obsidian_process = QProcess(self)
        obsidian_path = "/home/daniel/AppImages/obsidian.appimage"
        obsidian_process.start(obsidian_path)

        # Perplexity.AI (right half)
        perplexity_view = QWebEngineView()
        perplexity_view.setUrl(QUrl("https://www.perplexity.ai"))

        layout.addWidget(perplexity_view)
        layout.setStretch(0, 1)
        layout.setStretch(1, 1)

    def closeEvent(self, event):
        # Ensure Obsidian process is terminated when closing the app
        for child in self.children():
            if isinstance(child, QProcess):
                child.terminate()
                child.waitForFinished(1000)
        event.accept()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app = QApplication(sys.argv)
    window = MainWindow()
    window.show()
    sys.exit(app.exec_())
```

To run this program, you'll need to install the required dependencies. Here are the steps to set up and run the application:

1. Install the required packages:
```
sudo dnf install python3-pyqt5 python3-pyqt5-webengine
```

2. Save the above Python script to a file, for example, `obsidian_perplexity_gui.py`.

3. Make the script executable:
```
chmod +x obsidian_perplexity_gui.py
```

4. Run the script:
```
python3 obsidian_perplexity_gui.py
```

This script creates a full-screen GUI with Obsidian embedded on the left half and Perplexity.AI on the right half. It uses QProcess to launch Obsidian as a separate process and QWebEngineView to embed Perplexity.AI's website.

Note that this implementation embeds Perplexity.AI directly into the app rather than using Google Chrome. If you prefer to use Google Chrome, you would need to modify the script to launch Chrome with the specified arguments using QProcess, similar to how Obsidian is launched.

Also, ensure that the path to the Obsidian AppImage is correct on your system. If it's different, update the `obsidian_path` variable in the script accordingly.

This solution provides a clean, professional interface that combines both Obsidian and Perplexity.AI in a single, full-screen application on your Fedora computer.
