title: "Which APIs currently provide access to CodeLlama Python?"
---

Yes, you can access **CodeLlama - Python** via an API through several cloud platforms. This allows you to leverage the model's capabilities without needing to run it locally. Here are some of the best options:

### 1. Replicate

Replicate offers a straightforward way to run **CodeLlama - Python** via an API. You can interact with the model using their Python, JavaScript, or cURL clients, making it easy to integrate into your development environment.

- **Steps to use Replicate API**:
  1. Sign up for Replicate and get your API token.
  2. Install the client for your preferred language (e.g., Python: `pip install replicate` or JavaScript: `npm install replicate`).
  3. Set your `REPLICATE_API_TOKEN` environment variable.
  4. Use the following Python code to generate Python scripts:

```python
import replicate

output = replicate.run(
    "meta/codellama-70b-instruct:a279116fe47a0f65701a8817188601e2fe8f4b9e04a518789655ea7b995851bf",
    input={"prompt": "Write a Python function that calculates factorial recursively."}
)

print("".join(output))
```

This will send a prompt to the **CodeLlama - Python** model and return the generated Python code\[1].

### 2. AIMLAPI

AIMLAPI provides access to multiple models, including **CodeLlama - Python (70B)** and **CodeLlama - Python (34B)**, via a unified API. This service specializes in generating and optimizing Python code, making it ideal for developers who need high-quality code generation.

- **Key Features**:
  - Supports complex coding tasks, including algorithm generation and real-time code corrections.
  - Offers an API for seamless integration into your applications\[2]\[3].

### 3. Clarifai

Clarifai also offers access to CodeLlama models via their API. You can use their client libraries (Python, JavaScript, cURL, etc.) to interact with **CodeLlama - Python**.

- **Steps to use Clarifai API**:
  1. Sign up for Clarifai and get an API key.
  2. Install the Clarifai client (e.g., `pip install clarifai`).
  3. Use the API to send prompts and receive Python script outputs.

Clarifai supports multiple programming languages and provides a user-friendly API for generating code snippets or full scripts\[5].

### 4. Amazon SageMaker

If you prefer using AWS infrastructure, you can deploy **CodeLlama - Python (70B)** on Amazon SageMaker and interact with it via an API endpoint.

- **Steps to use SageMaker**:
  1. Deploy CodeLlama on SageMaker JumpStart.
  2. Use the AWS SDK (`boto3`) to interact with the model by sending prompts and receiving generated code.

This is an excellent option if you're already using AWS services for your development workflows\[4].
