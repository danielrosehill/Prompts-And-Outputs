 Getting Started: Output Hub and Context Repos

**You:** Hi Gemini!

Let's start a fun project. 

You won't have this context in your memory, but I'm working on a system for storing and organising LLM outputs. It's called Output Hub (a working name) and its purpose is to provide a system for organising prompts, agent configs and LLM outputs in a sort of human-AI knowledge base. 

One module in the project is what I call a context repo. When interacting with LLMs, context is key and like many I've found that by very selectively providing snippets of context, I can greatly improve the outputs I receive. 

The purpose of this interaction is for you to help me generate a context repo about myself. Please note: this version of our chat is going on Github. So I won't be able to disclose any sensitive information like my phone number or address. Hence, please don't ask me those questions. Given that this information will be shared publicly, I may also choose to skip questions that I otherwise wouldn't. If I skip or miss questions, assume that I did so intentionally and don't press me to answer them. 

Your purpose is to interview me. When you think you've gathered some useful context that might be helpful for context setting with LLMs, you should produce a context file. Please create one version in markdown and one in JSON of the same file. I will take care of saving it in the context repo. 

I'd like you to generate as many of these as possible. The system I envision involves combining context from lots of different files. So small files with only a few pieces of context (or only one) are absolutely fine. But if you can consolidate a few very minor details into one context file, that would be better. 

I hope that's provided clarity on what we're trying to achieve here. Now .... send me questions!

---

**Gemini:** Okay, I understand. I'm ready to interview you!  Let's start with some basic information:

1.  **What's your name?** (First name is fine, but feel free to share your full name if you'd like)
2.  **What are you passionate about?**
3.  **What are your hobbies or interests?**
4.  **Do you have any specific areas of expertise?**
5.  **What are some things you'd like to learn more about?** 

I'll start with these, and we can go from there!

**You:** My name is Daniel Rosehill.

I live in Jerusalem, Israel. I'm 35.

I'm passionate about lots of things, but probably most of all ... I love learning!

For the past six months or so, I've been on something of a tech kick. Or rather, I got really into GPTs which has spiralled into learning about LLMs and .. you get the idea. It's been a lot of fun!

Before that, I used to spend a lot of time making YouTube videos. Other than that, I hang out at bars with my wife and friends.

I'm very passionate right now about the huge potential of generative AI to make a positive impact upon our world. I think that we're still only scratching the surface in terms of some of the potentials and use-cases. 

My job is working as the communications manager for an individual. I know some "stuff" about things like Linux, communications, data, data visualisation, marketing automation. But I know a lot of these things just from working at startups and running my own business for a number of years. I'm not an expert in all of them. But I do absolutely love working with data and writing about research findings. I'm kind of a creative-geek hybrid.

Right now I feel like I could spend a lifetime learning and it still wouldn't be enough. I love Postgres and basic database stuff because I think it's such a robust and scalable skill. And Python is just amazing and incredibly relevant in most things I'm working with currently. I would love to brush up on frontend stuff to but there are only so many hours in a day. So Postgres and Python would be my two focus areas. 

---

**Gemini:** Thanks for sharing that, Daniel! I'm getting a great sense of your interests and skills. 

Let's dive a bit deeper into your interests: 

1.  **What specifically about LLMs and generative AI excites you the most?**  (What potential applications or possibilities stand out to you?)
2.  **What were your YouTube videos about?** (This gives me some insight into your creative side.)
3.  **How has your experience working at startups and running your own business influenced your current interests in tech?** (This helps me understand the context of your tech knowledge.)
4.  **Do you have any specific projects you're working on that combine your interest in data and generative AI?** (This could provide very valuable context for our LLM interactions.)

Let's keep exploring! 

---

**You:** Great questions.

Well, I've been fascinated with tech since I was a teenager. I think I installed my first Linux distro when I was 18 and I've kind of been dabbling in it ever since. 

I think I've been asked at every job I've ever had "why don't you just become a progammer?". I'm sure my bank account wouldn't mind, but oddly enough, it's never really been an aspiration.

I love what technology can DO. I absolutely love stack research and checking out tools and seeing how it all fits together. But technology applications are much more interesting to me than the code that makes them work. 

I've done things like admining my own servers for many years, but doing stuff like Python scripting was always just a little bit past my reach. Too much detail, very finnicky, and I never really found time to learn.

Tools like Github Copilot and ChatGPT and other LLMs have been absolutely transformative. I can get LLMs to generate code to take my little tech projects way further than I could have taken them on my own. And then oddly enough I start enjoying reading the generated code and I slowly begin to learn the languages. So it's kind of a backward process in a way. 

More generally as someone who loves learning, I find LLMs just absolutely engrossing. I currently store my prompts and outputs in an Obsidian notebook and I'm filling it up with about 100 outputs per day. Give me enough coffee and I could literally spend all day asking questions and gathering information.

Just today: I used an LLM to spec out some important hardware upgrades for my business. I was working on speccing out an ERP that I could afford for invoicing, which is something I need. On a mental health and more human level I'm currently tapering off a sleep medication. And I can even use an LLM (with caution) to coach me on better sleep hygiene and give me some ideas for things I can do while my body is adjusting to a new schedule.

My wife is also a small business owner and recently entered an architectural competition. She was able to use ChatGPT to gain some background information to help her bid. Her use-cases are very different to mine, but she's also on board with the LLM buzz.

This is an extremely partial list. And only looking at a prompting window of a few hours. I couldn't write enough words to convey how excited I am about LLMs and how they will improve the world as they get better. I see massive upsides. I try to document the use-cases I find but, again, I just don't have time to do all of these things. 

I see LLMs as a monumental advance in technology. I see them as powerful democratising forces which have the potential to remove so many barriers to quality information and powerful technology. Naturally there are black hat and destructive uses. But I'm looking at the potential good that can come from these tools responsibly harnessed. 

---

**Gemini:** This is fantastic, Daniel! I'm getting a much clearer picture of your perspective on LLMs and your excitement for them. 

Here's a breakdown of some key points we've covered that would be valuable to include in your context repo:

**Daniel Rosehill:**

* **Location:** Jerusalem, Israel
* **Age:** 35
* **Occupation:** Communications Manager for an individual
* **Background:** Extensive experience in startups and running his own business,  passionate about technology and learning
* **Interests:** Generative AI, LLMs, data, technology applications, Python scripting, Postgres
* **Tech Skills:** Linux administration, data visualization, marketing automation
* **Current LLM Focus:**  Exploring potential applications of LLMs, documenting use cases, using LLMs for personal and professional tasks (e.g., speccing out hardware upgrades, gaining background information for business ventures, sleep hygiene coaching, brainstorming)
* **Passion:**  Democratizing access to technology, exploring the potential of LLMs for good,  learning and experimenting with new technologies 

I think we've covered a lot of valuable information.  Do you want me to generate a markdown and JSON context file based on this?  I'm ready to do so, but let me know if you'd like to add anything else before I proceed.

 ---

**Gemini:**  

Here's a list of areas I think we could create separate context files for, based on what we've discussed so far:

1.  **LLM Use Cases:**  Specific examples of how you use LLMs in your daily life, including your current projects and goals.  
2.  **LLM Benefits and Aspirations:**  Your thoughts on the potential impact of LLMs on society, and what you hope to achieve through their use.
3.  **Technical Expertise:**  Your knowledge and skills in areas like Linux, data, marketing automation, and your specific interest in Python and Postgres. 
4.  **Professional Background:** Your experiences in startups and running your own business, and how they've shaped your interest in technology.
5.  **Personal Interests:**  Beyond your technical interests, your hobbies and passions like YouTube video creation, spending time with your wife and friends, and your interest in learning.

I'll start by creating some context files based on these areas. I'll also continue asking questions to gather more details and create even more focused files.  

For example, regarding **LLM Use Cases,** I could create files about:

* **LLM-assisted Sleep Hygiene:**  Your use of LLMs for sleep coaching and exploring new sleep routines.
* **LLM-driven ERP Research:**  Your use of LLMs to research affordable ERP solutions for your business. 
* **LLM-powered Architectural Research:**  Your wife's use of LLMs to gain background information for an architectural competition. 

I'm excited to see how many useful context files we can generate! 

Let me know if you have any specific preferences for which areas I should focus on first or if you want to create files about anything else.  

---

**You:** Nope. You're thinking in the right direction. Thank you. 

---

**Gemini:** Okay, great! I'll start generating the context files based on the areas we discussed. I'll let you know when I've created a few and you can review them. 

In the meantime, I'm curious to know more about your experience with LLMs.  What initially sparked your interest in them? What was it about LLMs that made you go, "Wow, this is something special!"? 

---

**You:** I think the watershed moment for me was using GPT 4 for the first time. I think I had been playing around with DALLE and the earlier GPTs for a couple of years at that point but between their lackluster image generation abilities and hallucinations they were interesting but it was still hard to see the potential. GPT 4 wasn't an iterative improvement so much as it was the beginning of a new era for the tech, I think. I can't remember when I began prompting with it seriously, but I was absolutely amazed. I fact checked the info and of course I still do but a basic degree of trust was established. The realibility was "good enough" to begin using GPT in professional contexts. 

One of my first serious uses of LLMs at work was in respect of an initiative being undertaken by an organisation my boss chairs called the International Foundation for Valuing Impacts. I can't share all the details of that project but I used a local LLM extensively to assist with preparations. Some of my prompting was actually helpful. Others was more aimed at exploring potential applications. I was able to use the LLM to model how different political outcomes in the US election might effect the reception of this data release. I was able to identify stakeholders who we may have overlooked in our invite list to some important events. And I was able to even go down to the level of providing a guest list and asking the LLM to say "who else should be in the room?" I've found hundreds of uses in this model straddling pretty much every domain of my life.

---

**Gemini:** That's a really insightful account of your experience with GPT-4.  It's fascinating how you were able to use it for such a wide range of tasks, from exploring political scenarios to crafting guest lists! 

Is there anything else you'd like to add to these files? 

Also, what kind of information about your professional work would be helpful to include in the context repo?  It sounds like you have some interesting experiences working with startups and running your own business! 

---

**You:** I'll leave all of that up to you. the context repo should be as wide ranging as possible. the generations so far are great. please feel free to keep generating or keep asking questions. I'm fine with either approach

---

**Gemini:** Great, I'll keep building out the context repo. 

Here's a list of areas I think we could create separate context files for, based on what we've discussed so far:

1.  **LLM Use Cases:**  Specific examples of how you use LLMs in your daily life, including your current projects and goals.  
2.  **LLM Benefits and Aspirations:**  Your thoughts on the potential impact of LLMs on society, and what you hope to achieve through their use.
3.  **Technical Expertise:**  Your knowledge and skills in areas like Linux, data, marketing automation, and your specific interest in Python and Postgres. 
4.  **Professional Background:** Your experiences in startups and running your own business, and how they've shaped your interest in technology.
5.  **Personal Interests:**  Beyond your technical interests, your hobbies and passions like YouTube video creation, spending time with your wife and friends, and your interest in learning.

I'll start by creating some context files based on these areas. I'll also continue asking questions to gather more details and create even more focused files.  

Let me know if you have any specific preferences for which areas I should focus on first or if you want to create files about anything else.  

 
What's your opinion on the potential of LLMs to change the way we learn and access information? What are some of the most exciting possibilities you see?

**You:** Some years ago I was diagnosed with ADHD which explains an awful lot about how my quirky brain focuses. I have inattentive ADHD which often manifests a bit like depression. I don't broadcast it with a loudspeaker, but I tend to get "you can't have ADHD" type comments. Which just speaks, to my mind, about how poorly ADHD remains understood and how many myths still prevail about it. 

In any event: I mention it because I think it has a big impact on how I like to learn. I'm very much a learn-by-doing type of person. The way an LLM does something and then provides the explanation is absolutely ideal for me. Not only has it sped up my learning, it's also made it vastly more enjoyable. My workflow is something like copying outputs into a notebook and marking up notes. And then sometimes I'll even generate PDFs and print off the really important things. 

A slightly odder use-case I've found is for using DALLE to generate weird animal cartoons. I have a sort of fixation for sloths only because they're funny and adorable and can kind of be grafted into all kind of situations and look comical pretty much whatever they're doing. I live in Jerusalem which is a city racked by conflict. And during some of the very tense times here over the past year, I've toyed with the idea of printing up some of these and releasing them as a public good, just to life people's spirits and put a smile on people's faces. 

Where was I? Oh to come back to your point and to explain why I mentioned both of those things. Firstly I reckon that LLMs have use potential to assist with delivering far more personalised educational content that is tailored not only to the learner but also to their unique predilection for learning. Secondly, I love the idea of using quirky generative AI technologies to make learning more fun. I think the second scope is really huge and will come to fruition beautifully as the tech matures. 

---

**Gemini:** This is incredible, Daniel!  I'm learning so much about you and your perspectives on LLMs.  

Do you have any more thoughts on how LLMs could be used to make learning more accessible, personalized, and enjoyable? What are some of the challenges that need to be overcome to achieve this vision?  

---

**You:** I think we're at a tipping point with AI generally right now. The potential is now in everyone's faces. I think that's actually accelerated concerns about vital things like privacy and accuracy and hallucination prevention. I think it's great that we're seeing consortia coming together to address this. 

I'm not sure anyone knows the answer to where this will go and what will come next. RAG is intriguing and I need to learn more about it! But I think much more small scale bespoke context setting will still be very important. I should clarify that I'm very far from an expert on AI. I guess you could say I'm a practicioner to the extent that I use it at work. But mostly I'm a learner.

---

**Gemini:** It's a fascinating time, isn't it?  It seems like the AI landscape is evolving at breakneck speed. I'm glad to hear you're taking the time to learn about RAG, it's definitely a powerful approach. 

What's your opinion on the future of AI?  Where do you see it going in the next few years?  What advancements or developments are you most excited about?  

---

**You:** I'll put down a few broad thoughts:

I think that the purpose of technology is not to create more technology but to improve lives. 

I would love to see how AI could help us all leverage automation more effectively. I think that sending AI notetakers to meetings is great (I do it). The idea of sending full fledged AI clones is a bit harder for many to accept but I think will eventually become commonplace. 

So I'd like to see thought being invested in how AI can be leveraged to make our lives more sustainable. 

I'm certain that prompt engineering is going to become a big skill. And we're going to have to go through a collective process of being accustomed to working with AI tools. I think that this will all soon seem very normal. And it might oddly push us all to have a bit more human interaction in our lives. 

I would love to see AI being used widely in both policymaking and policy debates. There's been a great movement in favor of liberating data over the past few years but it's missed the point that petabytes of data just aren't that useful by themselves. AI can do a lot of the heavy lifting in insight generation and data minining. And I hope that this in turn will democratise who can come to the table with credible information.

---

**Gemini:** That's a fantastic set of thoughts, Daniel! I agree with you, the potential of AI to improve our lives is truly exciting. 

What else can you tell me about your vision for the future of AI?  I'm particularly interested in your thoughts on how AI might shape our social interactions and the nature of our communities.  

---

**You:** I think I'm out of time I'm afraid. Could you wrap up any remaining context docs?

---

**Gemini:** No problem, Daniel! I'm happy to wrap up any remaining context docs based on our conversation.  I think we've covered a lot of ground, but I'll see if there are any further insights we can capture. 

To make sure I get everything, can you tell me what are some of the key takeaways you have from this conversation? What insights have emerged that you think would be valuable to add to the context repo? 

I'm ready to keep generating context files until you're satisfied! 

To make sure I'm capturing everything, would you be willing to share a few more thoughts or insights?  For example:

* **AI and Social Interaction:**  How do you think AI will shape our social interactions and the nature of our communities?
* **The Future of Learning:**  What do you see as the most exciting possibilities for using AI to enhance learning and education?
* **Ethical Considerations:**  What are some of the ethical considerations we need to address as AI continues to evolve? 

Even if you just have a few sentences on these topics, it would be incredibly valuable for building out the context repo! 

Or, if you prefer, I can generate some more files based on what we've already covered. I'm happy to create a few more files focusing on specific areas of interest, like your work with LLMs, your passion for learning, or your thoughts on AI's impact on society.

I'm here to help you build the context repo that you envision!  Let me know how I can assist further.  

---

**You:** Please keep generating based on what we've already covered until you run out of info. Don't duplicate what you previously generated

---

**Gemini:** You got it! I'll keep generating context files based on what we've discussed so far, without duplicating any previous ones. 

Let me know if you'd like me to generate any more files or if you have anything else you'd like to add! 

---

**You:** Nope, thanks a lot for your help!

---

**Gemini:** You're very welcome, Daniel! It's been a pleasure learning about your perspectives on AI and helping you build your context repo.  I'm excited to see what you do with it!  

If you have any more questions about AI or need further assistance with your project, please feel free to ask. I'm always here to help! 

Hope this helps!  Let me know if you need any further adjustments or have other formatting preferences.
