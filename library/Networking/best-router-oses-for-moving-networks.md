Yes, there are several router operating systems (OSes) that are designed to handle network configurations in a way that can make relocating to a new physical location smoother. Here are some options to consider, each with features that may help with a seamless transition:

### 1. **MikroTik RouterOS**
   - **Key Feature: Configuration Export/Import**
     - MikroTik routers, running **RouterOS**, offer robust configuration backup and restore capabilities. You can **export your entire configuration** to a script file, which can be easily applied to a new router. This feature allows you to set up a new device or move your configuration to a different location with minimal hassle.
     - MikroTik's **CAPsMAN (Centralized AP Management)** makes it easier to manage Wi-Fi settings across multiple access points. If your network relies on multiple APs, this centralization helps keep configurations consistent, even when moving locations.
   - **Versatile Networking Features**: RouterOS can handle complex networking setups, including VLANs, routing, and VPN configurations, making it adaptable to different environments.

### 2. **pfSense**
   - **Key Feature: Full Backup and Restore**
     - **pfSense** is a popular open-source firewall/router OS that offers **full system backup**. The backup can be restored on a different pfSense box, making it easy to transition the same configuration to new hardware or a new location.
     - **Configuration Flexibility**: pfSense allows you to modify settings to adapt to new network environments, such as changing IP ranges or adjusting firewall rules. The web-based interface makes it straightforward to adjust settings after relocation.
   - **Static IP Adjustments**: If you move to a different location with a new ISP or network range, pfSense allows easy adjustments to DHCP, firewall rules, and static IP configurations.

### 3. **OpenWrt**
   - **Key Feature: Modular and Portable Configuration**
     - **OpenWrt** is another flexible, open-source router OS that can adapt well to different environments. It allows users to **backup configurations** and restore them on different hardware, which can be useful when setting up a new router at a different location.
     - **Script-Based Configuration**: You can create custom scripts to set up your network, making it easier to reapply the same settings on a new device. OpenWrt’s package system also makes it possible to install the same set of tools on multiple routers, facilitating a smoother migration.
   - **Configurable Network Settings**: OpenWrt supports a wide range of networking options, including **VLANs, advanced routing, and VPNs**, making it adaptable to varying network setups that might change after relocation.

### 4. **Ubiquiti UniFi OS**
   - **Key Feature: Centralized Management via UniFi Controller**
     - **UniFi** devices from Ubiquiti can be centrally managed through the **UniFi Controller**, which can be hosted locally or in the cloud. This allows you to manage multiple devices, including routers, switches, and access points, under a single configuration.
     - **Seamless Redeployment**: You can back up your UniFi configuration and **restore it on another controller** or set up devices at a new location with minimal manual reconfiguration. This makes it easy to relocate your network and re-establish the same settings across different sites.
   - **Adapts to New Environments**: UniFi’s approach to centralized management allows you to change IP schemes, adjust SSIDs, and configure routing rules centrally, reducing the need for device-by-device adjustments after a move.

### 5. **VyOS**
   - **Key Feature: Configuration Scripting and CLI**
     - **VyOS** is a Linux-based router OS that uses a **CLI** (Command-Line Interface) for configuration. You can **export your running configuration** as a script, which can be re-imported on a new instance of VyOS. This makes it easy to replicate the same setup across different devices.
     - **Virtualization Support**: VyOS can run on virtual machines, allowing you to test configurations before deploying them on physical hardware. This flexibility makes it easier to manage changes when moving locations.
   - **Adaptable Networking**: Like other advanced router OSes, VyOS supports complex networking setups, including routing, VPN, and firewall configurations, allowing for seamless adjustments based on new network parameters.

### 6. **EdgeOS (Ubiquiti EdgeRouter)**
   - **Key Feature: Robust Backup and Restore**
     - **EdgeOS**, used in Ubiquiti's EdgeRouter line, allows you to **export and import configurations**. This backup functionality is useful for deploying the same settings on a new router or at a new location. 
     - **Web UI and CLI Options**: Users can leverage both the web-based interface and the command line to configure the router, offering flexibility when making changes after a move.
   - **Simple Adjustments for New Networks**: You can easily modify DHCP settings, static IP ranges, and firewall rules, making it adaptable to new ISPs or network topologies.

### Considerations for Choosing a Router OS
- **Ease of Backup/Restore**: Systems that allow for easy **export and import** of configurations will make transitions smoother. Ensure that the backup process includes all critical settings, including VLANs, IP assignments, and routing rules.
- **Centralized Management**: If you are managing multiple devices (e.g., routers, switches, APs), a system that offers **centralized management** (like UniFi) can save time and effort when relocating.
- **Adaptability**: Choose an OS that can handle changes to network structure (e.g., different IP ranges or new ISP settings) without needing a complete reconfiguration.

### Conclusion
For seamless relocation of a network configuration, systems like **MikroTik RouterOS**, **pfSense**, and **Ubiquiti's UniFi OS** are among the best options due to their robust backup/restore features and centralized management capabilities. **OpenWrt** and **VyOS** are excellent choices for those who prefer open-source flexibility and script-based setups. These router OSes simplify the process of moving configurations to new hardware or physical locations, reducing downtime and ensuring consistency.
