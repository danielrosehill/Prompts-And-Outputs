# Prompt

Now that we've established that it's ZFS, could you give me a command which will show ideally all of these details: current disk usage, current disk remaining. ZFS status. Last scrub. List of all discs in the server.

# Output

To display all the requested details about your **ZFS** pool and the disks in your server, you can use the following **commands**. Each command provides specific information about the pool's status, disk usage, and hardware:

### 1. **ZFS Pool Status, Scrub Information, and Disk Usage**
This command will provide the **current status**, **scrub history**, and **disk usage** (used/available space) for the ZFS pool:

```bash
zpool list -v
```

- This will show:
  - **Size**: Total size of the ZFS pool.
  - **Alloc**: Allocated (used) space.
  - **Free**: Remaining free space.
  - **Health**: Health of the ZFS pool.

You can also use the following to get a more detailed status (including the last scrub and individual disk health):

```bash
zpool status
```

- **Scan** field will show the date and result of the last scrub.

### 2. **Detailed Disk Usage Information**
For detailed usage statistics of each dataset within the ZFS pool, including **used** and **available** space, run:

```bash
zfs list
```

- This will show how much space is used by each dataset and how much remains available.

### 3. **List All Disks on the Server**
To list **all disks** currently connected to the server (whether or not they are part of the ZFS pool), use:

```bash
lsblk
```

- This will list all block devices, including mounted and unmounted drives, and show their sizes, mount points, and partitions.

Alternatively, for more detailed information, including **UUIDs** and partitions:

```bash
fdisk -l
```

This command will show detailed partition and disk information for all drives on the server.

### Combined Workflow

If you want to combine the most relevant commands into one workflow to display current **ZFS status**, **disk usage**, and all **disks** on the server, hereâ€™s an ideal command sequence:

```bash
echo "ZFS Pool Status:" && zpool status && echo -e "\nZFS Pool Usage:" && zfs list && echo -e "\nDisks on Server:" && lsblk
```

- **`zpool status`**: Shows ZFS status, including last scrub.
- **`zfs list`**: Shows detailed usage statistics of the ZFS pool.
- **`lsblk`**: Lists all disks on the server.

This will provide all the relevant information in one go. Let me know if you need further customization!
