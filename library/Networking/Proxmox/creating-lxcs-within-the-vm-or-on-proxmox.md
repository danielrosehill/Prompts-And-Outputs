# Prompt

I have a home server which is running Proxmox. 
Currently, I've provisioned one Ubuntu VM.
I'd like to begin hosting a number of local services that I can access from the WAN. I use Cloudflare Tunnels for external access (this is already set up)
Is the best way to do this by creating LXCs within the VM, by creating them on Proxmox, or something else?

# Output
Since you're using **Proxmox** and already have **Cloudflare Tunnels** set up for external access, your best approach depends on the level of isolation, resource management, and convenience you want for managing multiple services. Here's an evaluation of your options:

### Option 1: **Create LXCs Directly on Proxmox**
This is the **most efficient** and **direct approach**. Proxmox natively supports **LXC containers**, which are lightweight, require fewer resources than VMs, and provide sufficient isolation for hosting multiple services.

#### Benefits of LXCs on Proxmox:
- **Efficiency**: LXCs use fewer resources than full VMs. They share the host kernel, meaning you can run more containers with less overhead.
- **Isolation**: Each service runs in its own container, providing isolation between services.
- **Simplified Networking**: Since you're running the containers directly on Proxmox, managing networking is more straightforward. You can configure Proxmox to assign IPs to each LXC and expose them via **Cloudflare Tunnels**.
- **Easy Management**: Proxmox’s web UI makes it easy to manage, back up, and monitor your containers.

#### Steps:
1. **Create LXC Containers** on Proxmox:
   - In the Proxmox UI, create a new **LXC container** for each service (e.g., for Home Assistant, Nextcloud, etc.).
   - Choose a lightweight OS template like **Debian** or **Ubuntu**.
   - Assign appropriate resources for each container.
   
2. **Configure Networking**:
   - Set up a **bridged network** for the containers, so each LXC gets its own IP address.
   - Use **Cloudflare Tunnels** to securely expose these containers to the WAN without opening ports on your router.
   
3. **Deploy Services**:
   - Install and configure the services you want (each in its own container).
   - Use **Nginx Reverse Proxy** or other solutions within Proxmox to manage incoming traffic if needed.

#### When to use this option:
- If you want **efficient resource usage** and good service isolation.
- If you plan to host many services and need to easily manage, monitor, and back them up.
- If you prefer using Proxmox's full feature set (backups, snapshots, resource management).

### Option 2: **Create LXCs Inside the Ubuntu VM**
This approach adds an extra layer of complexity because you're running containers inside a VM that itself runs on Proxmox. While this is possible, it introduces unnecessary overhead and complexity.

#### Drawbacks:
- **Double virtualization**: Running containers inside a VM is less efficient than running them directly on Proxmox.
- **More network complexity**: You’d need to manage both the VM’s network and the LXC container’s network inside the VM, which could make things more complicated.
- **Less flexibility**: Managing backups and resources for containers within the VM is more complicated than using Proxmox’s built-in tools for LXC containers.

#### When to use this option:
- If you have a specific reason to keep everything inside the existing Ubuntu VM (e.g., already configured software dependencies, or you prefer managing everything inside the VM).
- For testing or smaller projects where performance isn't as critical.

### Option 3: **Running Everything Within the Ubuntu VM (No LXC)**
You could also choose to run all services directly within the Ubuntu VM by installing them and exposing them through **Cloudflare Tunnels**. This option is the simplest to set up initially but offers less isolation between services.

#### Benefits:
- **Simpler Setup**: No need for container management.
- **Centralized Management**: All services run in one place, making it easy to monitor.

#### Drawbacks:
- **No isolation**: All services share the same OS environment. If one service crashes or has security vulnerabilities, it could affect others.
- **Resource Management**: It’s harder to allocate resources like CPU and memory to individual services.

#### When to use this option:
- If you only plan to run a few services and don’t need much isolation.
- If you're comfortable managing everything within a single VM.

### Recommended Approach: **Option 1 – LXCs Directly on Proxmox**
Given that you already use **Cloudflare Tunnels** and want to host multiple services, the best approach would be to:
- **Create LXC containers directly on Proxmox** for each service.
- Use Cloudflare Tunnels to manage external access securely.
- Use Proxmox’s built-in tools for resource management, backups, and monitoring.

This setup gives you the benefits of efficient resource usage, strong isolation between services, and simplified networking, all while leveraging Proxmox’s robust feature set.
