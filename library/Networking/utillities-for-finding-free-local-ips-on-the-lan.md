Got it! Here are Linux commands for using `nmap` and `arp-scan` to find available IP addresses on your local network:

### Option 1: Using `nmap`
`nmap` is a versatile network scanner that can be used to find active devices on your subnet.

1. **Install `nmap`**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install nmap
   ```
   or on Fedora:
   ```bash
   sudo dnf install nmap
   ```

2. **Scan the Network**:
   ```bash
   sudo nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24
   ```
   - **Explanation**:
     - `-sn` (ping scan) lists all the devices on the network without doing a port scan.
     - `192.168.1.0/24` scans the entire subnet (change the IP range as necessary).
   - **Output**:
     - The output will list the IP addresses that are active. Any IP not listed is likely available.

### Option 2: Using `arp-scan`
`arp-scan` allows you to quickly scan your local network for devices, using ARP to discover active IP addresses.

1. **Install `arp-scan`**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install arp-scan
   ```
   or on Fedora:
   ```bash
   sudo dnf install arp-scan
   ```

2. **Scan the Network**:
   ```bash
   sudo arp-scan --interface=ens18 192.168.1.0/24
   ```
   - **Explanation**:
     - `--interface=ens18`: Replace `ens18` with your actual network interface name (you can find your interface using `ip a`).
     - `192.168.1.0/24`: Scans all IP addresses within the `192.168.1.0` subnet.
   - **Output**:
     - The output will list the IP addresses that are currently in use. If `192.168.1.100` doesnâ€™t appear in the list, that means it's likely available.

### Summary
- **`nmap`**: Provides a list of all devices that responded to ping requests.
- **`arp-scan`**: Uses ARP requests to find devices; useful in environments where ICMP ping may be blocked.

Both methods will give you a good overview of which IP addresses are in use, allowing you to find a free one.
