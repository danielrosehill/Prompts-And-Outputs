Yes, there are several tools similar to **Pi-hole** that focus primarily on **DNS resolution** rather than ad-blocking or other filtering functions. These tools act as **local DNS resolvers** and provide advanced DNS functionalities, often designed to improve speed, privacy, and control over DNS traffic.

Here are some tools that primarily focus on **DNS resolution**:

### 1. **Unbound**
   - **Type**: Recursive, caching DNS resolver.
   - **Focus**: Secure and private DNS resolution.
   - **Features**:
     - **Full DNS resolver**: It works as a **recursive DNS resolver**, meaning it resolves queries directly from authoritative DNS servers without relying on external third-party resolvers.
     - **Caching**: It caches DNS results, which can improve lookup speeds for frequently accessed domains.
     - **DNS-over-TLS** and **DNS-over-HTTPS**: Supports encrypted DNS queries, which ensures privacy by preventing DNS queries from being intercepted.
     - **Customization**: It allows for granular DNS configuration, including setting up local zones, blacklisting domains, or forwarding certain queries to specific upstream DNS servers.
   - **Use Case**: Perfect for users who want a private DNS resolver and better control over their DNS resolution but don't need ad-blocking or extra filtering features.

   **Installation**: Available for most Linux distributions.
   ```bash
   sudo apt install unbound
   ```

   **Configuration**: Customizable via the `/etc/unbound/unbound.conf` file.

### 2. **dnsmasq**
   - **Type**: Lightweight DNS forwarder and DHCP server.
   - **Focus**: Simplified DNS forwarding with integrated DHCP capabilities.
   - **Features**:
     - **DNS forwarding**: Forwards DNS queries to upstream DNS servers of your choice (such as Google DNS or Cloudflare).
     - **DNS caching**: Caches DNS results for faster subsequent queries.
     - **Local DNS records**: Easily set up local domain resolution for devices in your local network (e.g., resolving `myserver.local` to `192.168.1.100`).
     - **DHCP integration**: Can also act as a DHCP server, which simplifies IP assignment for home networks.
   - **Use Case**: Ideal for users who need a lightweight DNS solution that also provides DHCP services and basic DNS forwarding/caching.

   **Installation**: Available for most Linux distributions.
   ```bash
   sudo apt install dnsmasq
   ```

   **Configuration**: Via the `/etc/dnsmasq.conf` file.

### 3. **BIND (Berkeley Internet Name Domain)**
   - **Type**: Full-fledged DNS server.
   - **Focus**: Authoritative and recursive DNS services.
   - **Features**:
     - **Recursive and authoritative DNS**: Can serve as both a recursive resolver (for resolving external domains) and an authoritative DNS server (for serving your own domain names).
     - **Highly customizable**: BIND is very flexible and can be configured for advanced use cases, such as split-horizon DNS (serving different DNS results based on source IP).
     - **DNSSEC**: Supports DNSSEC for ensuring DNS responses have not been tampered with.
     - **Logging and monitoring**: Provides advanced logging features for monitoring DNS queries and performance.
   - **Use Case**: Great for users who need full control over DNS and need features like DNSSEC or want to run their own authoritative DNS server.

   **Installation**: Available for most Linux distributions.
   ```bash
   sudo apt install bind9
   ```

   **Configuration**: Configuration is typically handled in `/etc/bind/named.conf` and other related files.

### 4. **CoreDNS**
   - **Type**: Plugin-driven DNS server.
   - **Focus**: Extensible, cloud-native DNS resolution.
   - **Features**:
     - **Modular architecture**: CoreDNS is designed with a plugin-based system, allowing you to add or remove features based on your needs (e.g., DNS caching, forwarding, or blacklisting).
     - **Kubernetes integration**: Popular for handling DNS resolution in **Kubernetes clusters**.
     - **Fast and lightweight**: Built to be efficient, making it ideal for high-performance environments.
     - **DNS-over-TLS/HTTPS support**: Supports encrypted DNS queries for privacy.
   - **Use Case**: CoreDNS is ideal for cloud and container-based environments, or for users looking for a flexible, modular DNS resolver that can be tailored to specific use cases.

   **Installation**: Available via binary releases or through package managers like `snap` or building from source.

   **Configuration**: Via simple configuration files (`Corefile`).

### 5. **AdGuard Home (DNS-Only Mode)**
   - **Type**: DNS server with filtering (DNS-only mode available).
   - **Focus**: Privacy-first DNS server with optional blocking.
   - **Features**:
     - **DNS resolution**: Acts as a local DNS server that can forward queries to upstream servers like Google, Cloudflare, or OpenDNS.
     - **DNS-over-TLS/HTTPS**: Supports encrypted DNS requests.
     - **Optional filtering**: Although AdGuard Home is known for its ad-blocking capabilities, it can be configured to run in **DNS-only mode**, providing DNS resolution without any filtering.
   - **Use Case**: If you're looking for a privacy-focused DNS resolver with the ability to add filtering later, AdGuard Home in DNS-only mode is a good option.

   **Installation**: Available as a package or Docker container.

   **Configuration**: Via a web interface or configuration files.

### 6. **Knot Resolver**
   - **Type**: DNS resolver focused on performance and security.
   - **Focus**: High-performance, caching DNS resolver with advanced features.
   - **Features**:
     - **DNS-over-TLS/HTTPS**: Supports encrypted DNS queries.
     - **Caching**: Caches DNS queries to improve speed and reduce latency for repeated lookups.
     - **DNSSEC**: Built with DNSSEC validation as a primary feature for secure lookups.
     - **Modular**: Similar to CoreDNS, itâ€™s extensible via modules for additional features like DNS blacklisting or custom forwarding.
   - **Use Case**: Knot Resolver is great for users looking for a **high-performance DNS resolver** with DNSSEC and modern encryption protocols, particularly in environments that need fast DNS resolution.

   **Installation**: Available in Linux distributions or built from source.
   ```bash
   sudo apt install knot-resolver
   ```

   **Configuration**: Managed via `/etc/knot-resolver/kresd.conf`.

### **Conclusion**
If you're looking for a **DNS resolver** without the extra features like ad-blocking that Pi-hole provides, tools like **Unbound**, **dnsmasq**, or **Knot Resolver** might be perfect for you. These solutions allow you to set up and manage DNS traffic efficiently, providing flexibility, caching, and privacy features while remaining lightweight and easy to manage.
