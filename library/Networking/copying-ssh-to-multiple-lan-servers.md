Yes, you can use `ssh-copy-id` along with a `for` loop in a single command to copy your SSH key to multiple LAN servers. This approach assumes that all the servers on your LAN have SSH enabled and you can access them using a password or already have SSH access.

Here's how you can copy your SSH key to multiple servers in one go:

### Steps to Copy SSH Key to Multiple Servers:

1. **Generate an SSH key** (if you don't already have one):
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
   ```

2. **Run the following command** to copy your SSH key to multiple servers:

```bash
for server in 192.168.1.1 192.168.1.2 192.168.1.3; do ssh-copy-id root@$server; done
```

### Explanation:
- **for server in 192.168.1.1 192.168.1.2 192.168.1.3**: This specifies the list of server IP addresses on your LAN.
- **ssh-copy-id root@$server**: This command copies your local public SSH key to each server in the list for the `root` user.
- **done**: Ends the loop.

You will be prompted to enter the password for each server the first time, and `ssh-copy-id` will install your public key (`~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`) on all the specified servers.

### Optional: Add More Servers
You can add more server IP addresses in the list:
```bash
for server in 192.168.1.1 192.168.1.2 192.168.1.3 192.168.1.4 192.168.1.5; do ssh-copy-id root@$server; done
```

### Alternative: Use `parallel` for Faster Execution
You can use `parallel` to run the SSH key copy process in parallel, which can be faster when working with many servers:

1. Install **GNU parallel** if it's not already installed:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install parallel
   ```

2. Use `parallel` to copy the SSH key to multiple servers at once:
   ```bash
   parallel ssh-copy-id root@{} ::: 192.168.1.1 192.168.1.2 192.168.1.3 192.168.1.4
   ```

This will execute `ssh-copy-id` in parallel for each server in the list.

### Summary:
- Use a `for` loop with `ssh-copy-id` to copy your SSH key to multiple servers.
- Optionally, use `parallel` for faster execution if you have many servers.
