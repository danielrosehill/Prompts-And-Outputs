If you want to provision a **dedicated rendering node** for **Autodesk Revit** on your **local area network (LAN)**, you will need to consider both the licensing costs for Revit itself and the hardware requirements to ensure that the node can handle rendering tasks efficiently. Below is an overview of the licensing options, costs, and recommended hardware setup for such a dedicated rendering system.

### **1. Licensing Costs for a Dedicated Rendering Node**

To provision a dedicated rendering node for Revit, you essentially need another instance of Revit that can be installed on the dedicated machine. Autodesk doesn't have specific "render-only" licenses for Revit like some other 3D software packages. Therefore, you'll need to follow one of the standard licensing models:

#### **a. Subscription License**
- **Revit License**: To use Revit on a dedicated node, you'll need a standard **Autodesk Revit license**, typically a subscription model. Autodesk only offers subscription-based licenses for Revit.
- **Cost**: The annual subscription for **Autodesk Revit** costs approximately **$2,675 per year** (as of the latest pricing information from Autodesk, but it may vary based on your location and specific offers).
- **Named User Licensing**: Autodesk licenses are typically **named-user** licenses, meaning the software is tied to specific user accounts. However, this can be managed for shared access within an organization.

#### **b. Network Licensing (FlexLM)**
- **FlexLM (Multi-User Licensing)**: If you have an **enterprise subscription** with Autodesk, you may have the option for **network licenses** (sometimes called **floating licenses**). This model uses **Autodesk License Manager (FlexLM)**, allowing multiple users to access Revit across a network, including a dedicated rendering node.
  - **Cost**: This model is generally more expensive upfront, but it provides flexibility for users within the same organization. Costs for enterprise licensing need to be discussed with Autodesk directly.
  - **Rendering Use**: With FlexLM, you can set up a rendering node and allocate licenses based on rendering workloads during non-peak hours.

#### **c. Revit LT (Limitations)**
- Note that **Revit LT** is a lighter version of Revit and is much cheaper (about **$500 per year**), but it lacks many features, including **network collaboration** and **full 3D rendering**, making it unsuitable as a dedicated rendering node.

### **2. Recommended Hardware for a Revit Rendering Node**

Rendering is a resource-intensive task, so you'll need to choose the hardware carefully to ensure smooth and efficient rendering performance. Below are the hardware recommendations for a **dedicated Revit rendering node**:

#### **a. CPU (Central Processing Unit)**
- **High Core Count**: Rendering is often CPU-bound, so choosing a processor with a high core count is ideal. **AMD Ryzen Threadripper** or **Intel Xeon** CPUs are excellent choices.
  - **Recommended**: 
    - **AMD Ryzen Threadripper PRO 3995WX** (64 cores, 128 threads)
    - **Intel Xeon W-3375** (28 cores, 56 threads)
- **Clock Speed**: A higher clock speed will also improve single-threaded tasks in Revit (e.g., scene preparation).
- **Budget Option**: **AMD Ryzen 9 5950X** or **Intel Core i9-13900K** provide a balance of cores and clock speed, suitable for mid-level rendering needs.

#### **b. GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)**
- For rendering tasks that can take advantage of GPU acceleration (e.g., using **Enscape** or **V-Ray**):
  - **NVIDIA RTX Series** is recommended. 
    - **NVIDIA RTX 4090** or **RTX A6000** (if budget allows) provide excellent performance.
    - **NVIDIA RTX 3080** or **RTX A4000** offer a good performance-to-price ratio.
  - **CUDA Cores**: The more CUDA cores, the better for rendering.

#### **c. RAM**
- **Memory Requirements**: At least **64 GB** of RAM is recommended, especially for larger projects. Revit and other rendering software consume a significant amount of memory.
- **Expandable**: Ensure that the node can expand memory up to **128 GB** or **256 GB** if your rendering needs grow.

#### **d. Storage**
- **SSD (Solid State Drive)**: A **fast NVMe SSD** is essential for fast data access during rendering. 
  - **Recommended Size**: At least **1 TB NVMe SSD** for the operating system and Revit files.
  - **Secondary Storage**: You might also consider a larger **HDD** (e.g., **4 TB**) for project backup and archiving.

#### **e. Cooling and Power Supply**
- **Cooling**: Rendering nodes generate significant heat due to CPU and GPU loads. Consider **liquid cooling** or high-quality **air cooling** systems.
- **Power Supply**: A reliable **power supply unit (PSU)** of at least **1000W**, particularly if using high-end CPUs and GPUs.

#### **f. Network Connectivity**
- **Wired Network (Gigabit Ethernet)**: Ensure the rendering node has a **gigabit or 10-gigabit Ethernet** connection for fast file transfers, especially if dealing with large Revit files across the LAN.

### **3. Software Setup and Configuration**
- **Operating System**: Windows 10 Pro or Windows 11 Pro, since Revit is primarily supported on Windows.
- **Rendering Software**:
  - **V-Ray** or **Enscape**: If you want GPU-accelerated rendering.
  - **Autodesk 3ds Max**: Revit models can be exported to **3ds Max**, which can then be used for rendering if you need more advanced features.
  
### **4. Setting Up the Rendering Node for Use in Revit**
- **Shared Network Resources**: Once the dedicated rendering node is configured, you can set it up on your network to be accessible to different users.
- **Batch Rendering**: You can use **batch rendering scripts** to queue multiple rendering jobs on the node.
- **Remote Desktop/Access**: Use tools like **Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)** or **TeamViewer** to access and control the rendering node remotely.

### **Summary**
- **Licensing**: You need an additional **Autodesk Revit license** (around **$2,675 per year**). If you have an enterprise network license, you can share Revit among multiple users.
- **Recommended Hardware**: Invest in a powerful **CPU** (like AMD Threadripper), **GPU** (like NVIDIA RTX), **64 GB+ RAM**, and **fast NVMe SSDs**.
- **Network Setup**: Ensure the rendering node is easily accessible within the LAN, preferably using **Gigabit Ethernet**.
