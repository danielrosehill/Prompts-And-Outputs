# Prompt

Let me describe what I'm trying to achieve with these home network edits.
My ISP supplies a router. It doesn't support bridge mode natively.
I have a number of different devices on the home network including one home server, an ingress gateway for WAN traffic coming from Cloudflare Tunnels (a mini PC).
WiFi is managed via a TP Link Deco mesh network. There are two networks: one with dual 2.4 and 5 Ghz and another with 2.4 only for smart devices (the apartment came with several WiFi smart plugs so we have no choice but to use it)
For smart home devices, it's a mixture of Wifi devices connected to the 2.4 network and Zigbee devices connected with Zigbee2MQTT onto Home Assistant which runs on a VM on the Ubuntu home server
At some point in the next year, we're going to move apartment. As there are a number of LAN routes I use for backups, I want to preserve the LAN network range so that I can keep the static IP assignments working
I could setup my own router but I'm looking for whatever might be the easiest way to preserve an accurate network configuration that can be reprovisioned after we move

# Output
**Summary of the prompt:** The user described their home network setup and asked for guidance on how to preserve the network configuration, including static IP assignments, when moving apartments.

### Preserving Network Configuration for a Move: Best Practices

To maintain an accurate network configuration that can be easily reprovisioned after moving, here are some steps and best practices tailored to your setup:

### 1. **Preserve LAN IP Range**
   - **Key Goal:** Ensure that the LAN network range (e.g., `192.168.1.x`) remains consistent when you move to avoid reconfiguring devices with static IPs.
   - **How to Achieve:**
     - **Set Custom IP Range on the ISP Router:** If possible, configure your ISP router to match your current LAN IP range. Even if it doesn’t support bridge mode, you can still set the LAN IP range manually.
     - **Configure Deco as Primary Router:** Consider setting the TP-Link Deco mesh as the primary router by using the **ISP router in DMZ mode** (pointing all traffic to the Deco), which will allow you to control the LAN IP range directly on the Deco.

### 2. **Backup Configuration Files**
   - **Router and Mesh System Backups:**
     - Most modern routers, including TP-Link Deco systems, allow you to **export the current configuration**. This will save your Wi-Fi settings, LAN settings, IP ranges, and connected devices. Export these settings so you can easily restore them after the move.
     - Check if your ISP router also supports exporting its configuration. If it does, back it up as well, even if you intend to use the Deco as the main router.
   - **Static IP Reservations:**
     - Backup your list of **static IP reservations** from your Deco or any router you’re using. Document these IPs along with the corresponding devices.

### 3. **Ensure Consistent DHCP Settings**
   - **Fixed DHCP Range:**
     - Make sure your DHCP server (whether on the Deco or ISP router) uses the same range before and after the move. If your static IP devices are outside the DHCP range (e.g., DHCP covers `192.168.1.100-192.168.1.200`, and your static IPs are outside this range), they should continue to function without conflict.
   - **Manual Configuration Backup:**
     - **Document any special network routes** or configurations, especially for your **home server** and **ingress gateway**. Write down any custom routes, NAT rules, or other configurations you’ve set up.

### 4. **Use Static IP Mapping Where Possible**
   - **Why It Helps:** Keeping a consistent IP mapping ensures that devices that depend on each other (like your Home Assistant setup or backup routines) continue to communicate seamlessly.
   - **How to Set Up:**
     - Ensure that your devices (especially critical ones like the home server, mini PC ingress gateway, and VM running Home Assistant) have static IPs assigned **on the device** itself and not just via DHCP reservations. This makes them less reliant on router-specific settings.
     - **List of Static IPs:**
       - Maintain a **spreadsheet** or **document** listing each device’s static IP, MAC address, and function. This makes it easy to reconfigure your network if you need to swap out hardware or set up the same configuration again.

### 5. **Leverage a VLAN Setup (If Needed)**
   - **VLANs for Segmentation:**
     - If you’re currently or considering running different VLANs (e.g., one for general browsing, one for smart devices), make sure you configure the same VLANs at the new location. This helps keep traffic organized and ensures smart devices stay on their isolated network.
   - **Documentation of VLANs:**
     - Note down your VLAN IDs, the devices on each VLAN, and any custom firewall rules. This will help you replicate the same structure after the move.

### 6. **Plan for ISP Router Compatibility at the New Location**
   - **Research New ISP Options:**
     - If you will have a new ISP at the new apartment, research in advance if their routers support **bridge mode** or **DMZ**. You might need to adapt your setup depending on the router's capabilities.
   - **ISP Router in DMZ Mode:**
     - If the new ISP router doesn’t support bridge mode, set it up in **DMZ mode** to route all traffic to your Deco system, which can then handle all networking tasks.

### 7. **Back Up Your Smart Home Configuration**
   - **Home Assistant Backup:**
     - **Export your Home Assistant configuration**. This will save your integrations, Zigbee network, and all automation. If your VM setup has a backup feature, make a snapshot that you can restore after moving.
     - **Zigbee Network Consideration:** Zigbee devices should reconnect automatically to the hub if nothing changes in its configuration. Ensure your **Zigbee2MQTT** is set up to restore easily if any problems arise.

### 8. **Reprovisioning After the Move**
   - **Check Connectivity Before Placing Devices:**
     - Once the core network (router, Deco mesh, server) is set up at the new apartment, test the connection for a few critical devices. Ensure the LAN range and IP assignments are correct before setting up everything else.
   - **Reconfigure as Needed:**
     - Use your saved configurations and documentation to quickly set up any device that needs manual reconfiguration.

### Summary
To ensure a smooth transition to your new apartment, focus on preserving the **same LAN IP range**, backing up your **network configurations**, and assigning **static IPs** to critical devices. Using the **DMZ mode** on your ISP router can give your Deco mesh full control over the network, which simplifies managing and restoring configurations. Backup your **Home Assistant** and **Zigbee2MQTT** settings to ensure that your smart home network reconfigures smoothly after the move. Document all key settings, configurations, and IP assignments to simplify reprovisioning.
