### Text Inputs (Natural Language Schema Definition)

---

**Schema Name:** `Output Hub`

**1. Custom GPTs Table**
   - **Description:** Stores custom GPT configurations created by users.
   - **Fields:**
     - `ID`: A unique identifier for each custom GPT, generated automatically.
     - `GPT Name`: The name of the custom GPT configuration.
     - `Description`: A brief description of the GPT configuration.
     - `User ID`: The ID of the user who created the custom GPT, linked to the Users table.
     - `Created At`: The date and time when the custom GPT was created.

**2. Prompt Library Table**
   - **Description:** Stores different prompts that can be used by custom GPTs.
   - **Fields:**
     - `ID`: A unique identifier for each prompt in the library, generated automatically.
     - `Prompt Text`: The text of the prompt.
     - `Summary`: A brief summary of what the prompt is intended to achieve.
     - `Rating`: A rating for the prompt.
     - `Display in Library`: A boolean indicating whether the prompt should be displayed in the public library.
     - `Created At`: The date and time when the prompt was added to the library.
     - **Relationships:**
       - `Many-to-One`: Each prompt in the library can be associated with multiple prompt outputs. This relationship means each prompt output belongs to one prompt in the library.

**3. Prompt Outputs Table**
   - **Description:** Stores the outputs generated by executing prompts.
   - **Fields:**
     - `ID`: A unique identifier for each prompt output, generated automatically.
     - `Output Text`: The text of the output generated by the prompt.
     - `Accuracy Assessment ID`: An identifier for the accuracy assessment related to this output.
     - `Review Urgency ID`: An identifier for the urgency level for reviewing this output.
     - `Created At`: The date and time when the output was generated.
     - **Relationships:**
       - `Many-to-Many`: A prompt output can be associated with multiple prompts in the prompt library, and each prompt can have multiple associated outputs. This relationship is facilitated by a junction table linking the `Prompt Outputs` and `Prompt Library` tables.
       - `Many-to-One`: Each prompt output can belong to only one prompt in the `Prompt Library`.

**4. Prompt Outputs-Prompt Library Junction Table**
   - **Description:** Links the `Prompt Outputs` and `Prompt Library` tables to establish a many-to-many relationship between them.
   - **Fields:**
     - `Prompt Output ID`: The ID of the prompt output, linked to the `Prompt Outputs` table.
     - `Prompt Library ID`: The ID of the prompt in the library, linked to the `Prompt Library` table.

### Code Outputs (Eloquent Models)

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

// CustomGpt Model
class CustomGpt extends Model
{
    protected $fillable = ['gpt_name', 'description', 'user_id'];

    public function promptLibrary()
    {
        return $this->hasMany(PromptLibrary::class);
    }
}

// PromptLibrary Model
class PromptLibrary extends Model
{
    protected $fillable = ['prompt_text', 'summary', 'rating', 'display_in_library'];

    public function promptOutputs()
    {
        return $this->hasMany(PromptOutput::class);
    }

    public function customGpt()
    {
        return $this->belongsTo(CustomGpt::class);
    }
}

// PromptOutput Model
class PromptOutput extends Model
{
    protected $fillable = ['output_text', 'accuracy_assessment_id', 'review_urgency_id', 'prompt_library_id'];

    public function promptLibrary()
    {
        return $this->belongsTo(PromptLibrary::class);
    }

    public function promptLibraries()
    {
        return $this->belongsToMany(PromptLibrary::class, 'prompt_outputs_prompt_library');
    }
}

// PromptOutputsPromptLibrary Junction Table
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\Pivot;

class PromptOutputsPromptLibrary extends Pivot
{
    protected $table = 'prompt_outputs_prompt_library';

    protected $fillable = ['prompt_output_id', 'prompt_library_id'];
}
```

### Lesson: Defining M2M and M2O Relationships in Eloquent

When working with relational databases, understanding and defining relationships between tables is key to designing a robust and flexible schema. Eloquent, Laravel's ORM, makes it straightforward to define these relationships using simple methods within your models. Below, we'll walk through how to define Many-to-Many (M2M) and Many-to-One (M2O) relationships using the `Custom GPTs`, `Prompt Library`, and `Prompt Outputs` examples.

#### **1. Many-to-One (M2O) Relationship**

**Scenario:**
Each prompt output belongs to one prompt in the prompt library. This is a classic example of a Many-to-One relationship: many outputs are related to a single prompt.

**Eloquent Implementation:**

- **In the `PromptLibrary` Model:**
  ```php
  public function promptOutputs()
  {
      return $this->hasMany(PromptOutput::class);
  }
  ```

  - **Explanation:**
    - The `hasMany` method indicates that one prompt in the library can have many associated outputs.
    - This method should be placed in the `PromptLibrary` model.
  
- **In the `PromptOutput` Model:**
  ```php
  public function promptLibrary()
  {
      return $this->belongsTo(PromptLibrary::class);
  }
  ```

  - **Explanation:**
    - The `belongsTo` method specifies that each prompt output belongs to a single prompt in the library.
    - This method is placed in the `PromptOutput` model.

**Database Schema:**
- The `prompt_outputs` table will have a `prompt_library_id` foreign key that references the `id` in the `prompt_library` table.

---

#### **2. Many-to-Many (M2M) Relationship**

**Scenario:**
A prompt output can be associated with multiple prompts in the library, and each prompt can have multiple associated outputs. This is a Many-to-Many relationship.

**Eloquent Implementation:**

- **In the `PromptOutput` Model:**
  ```php
  public function promptLibraries()
  {
      return $this->belongsToMany(PromptLibrary::class, 'prompt_outputs_prompt_library');
  }
  ```

  - **Explanation:**
    - The `belongsToMany` method indicates that this model is related to many instances of another model, and vice versa.
    - The second parameter, `'prompt_outputs_prompt_library'`, specifies the name of the pivot table that facilitates this relationship.
  
- **In the `PromptLibrary` Model:**
  ```php
  public function promptOutputs()
  {
      return $this->belongsToMany(PromptOutput::class, 'prompt_outputs_prompt_library');
  }
  ```

  - **Explanation:**
    - Similar to the `PromptOutput` model, this method in the `PromptLibrary` model defines the Many-to-Many relationship in the opposite direction.

**Database Schema:**
- A junction (or pivot) table named `prompt_outputs_prompt_library` is required. This table contains two foreign keys:
  - `prompt_output_id`: References the `id` in the `prompt_outputs` table.
  - `prompt_library_id`: References the `id` in the `prompt_library` table.
- This table facilitates the many-to-many relationship between `prompt_outputs` and `prompt_library`.

**Junction Table Example:**
```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\Pivot;

class PromptOutputsPromptLibrary extends Pivot
{
    protected $table = 'prompt_outputs_prompt_library';

    protected $fillable = ['prompt_output_id', 'prompt_library_id'];
}
```

### Summary

- **Many-to-One (M2O):**
  - **`belongsTo`**: Defines the "many" side of the relationship in the model that has the foreign key.
  - **`hasMany`**: Defines the "one" side of the relationship in the related model.

- **Many-to-Many (M2M):**
  - **`belongsToMany`**: Used on both models involved in the relationship to define the many-to-many relationship.
  - **Pivot Table**: A separate table that holds the foreign keys from both related tables, facilitating the relationship.

Using these methods in Eloquent allows you to clearly define and manage relationships between your database tables, making your applicationâ€™s data structure more intuitive and easier to work with.
