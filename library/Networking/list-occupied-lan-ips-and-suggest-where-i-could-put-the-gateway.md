Based on your `nmap` output, here are the occupied IP addresses on your LAN:

### Occupied IP Addresses:
- **192.168.1.1** (MAC: BC:24:11:A9:FF:01)
- **192.168.1.2** (MAC: 60:BE:B4:12:CF:98)
- **192.168.1.3** (homeassistant) (MAC: BC:24:11:D6:9A:C2)
- **192.168.1.10** (MAC: 70:4D:7B:6E:19:72)
- **192.168.1.50** (MAC: 00:11:32:CD:09:DD)
- **192.168.1.101** (_gateway) (MAC: B0:BB:E5:A0:90:B7)
- **192.168.1.102** (MAC: 22:A9:CD:21:EE:C6)
- **192.168.1.105** (MAC: 28:87:BA:65:FD:CC)
- **192.168.1.106** (MAC: 28:87:BA:65:FC:28)
- **192.168.1.107** (MAC: 54:AF:97:5A:A3:4C)
- **192.168.1.114** (MAC: C2:45:45:7F:F6:E7)
- **192.168.1.131** (MAC: BC:24:11:A4:93:D8)
- **192.168.1.134** (MAC: A8:80:55:E7:A0:74)
- **192.168.1.147** (MAC: D4:8A:FC:AA:4E:D7)

### Available IP Address Suggestions for Gateway:
The IP addresses that are **not listed** above and can potentially be used for a gateway are:

- **192.168.1.4 - 192.168.1.9**
- **192.168.1.11 - 192.168.1.49**
- **192.168.1.51 - 192.168.1.100**
- **192.168.1.103 - 192.168.1.104**
- **192.168.1.108 - 192.168.1.113**
- **192.168.1.115 - 192.168.1.130**
- **192.168.1.132 - 192.168.1.133**
- **192.168.1.135 - 192.168.1.146**
- **192.168.1.148 and above**

### Recommended IPs for Gateway
Here are a few suggestions that would work well for your gateway:

1. **192.168.1.4**: This is an early IP address in the range, making it easy to remember.
2. **192.168.1.20**: A simple, clean number that is easy to identify and remember.
3. **192.168.1.99**: This is at the end of the common device range but before the gateway (`192.168.1.101`), making it distinct and recognizable.

These IP addresses are currently unoccupied according to your `nmap` scan and can be configured as the gateway IP.
