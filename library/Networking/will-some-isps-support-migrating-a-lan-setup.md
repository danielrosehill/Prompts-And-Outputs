**Summary of the prompt:** The user asked if it's possible to discuss preserving LAN settings with their ISP when moving to a new location and whether some ISPs can set up the same LAN configuration at the new place.

### Discussing Network Setup with Your ISP: What to Expect

Yes, it's definitely possible to discuss this with your ISP, but how much they can accommodate your request depends on their policies, network infrastructure, and the specific equipment they provide. Here’s what you can consider when approaching them:

### 1. **Request to Keep the Same LAN IP Range**
   - **What to Ask For:** When you move to a new location, you can ask your ISP to **replicate the same LAN IP settings** that you had at your current location. Explain that you have static IP assignments and would prefer to maintain the same network range (e.g., `192.168.1.x`) to avoid reconfiguring your devices.
   - **Potential ISP Response:**
     - Some ISPs are flexible and may be willing to set up your new router/modem with the same LAN IP range, especially if they understand that it will minimize disruption for your smart devices and network.
     - However, **not all ISPs offer this level of customization**, and some may have restrictions on the IP ranges you can use or how they set up their equipment.

### 2. **Consider Upgrading to a Business Plan**
   - **Why It Helps:** ISPs often provide more flexibility and options to business customers. This might include static IP addresses, advanced network configuration options, and better support for custom setups.
   - **What to Ask For:** 
     - Inquire whether upgrading to a **business plan** (even if you’re a residential customer) could allow more control over your network settings.
     - Ask specifically about **LAN IP range customization**, **bridge mode support**, and **static IP addresses**.
   - **Cost Consideration:** Business plans might cost more, but they can offer features like **bridge mode by default**, **static IPs**, and **priority support**.

### 3. **Discuss Bridge Mode or Pass-Through Mode Options**
   - **What to Ask For:** Explain to the ISP that you have your own router setup and would like to configure their modem/router to work in **bridge mode** or **pass-through mode** so that your TP-Link Deco handles all the networking. Even if the new ISP's router doesn’t natively support bridge mode, ask if they can enable a configuration that achieves the same effect (like **DMZ**).
   - **Potential ISP Response:** Some ISPs will assist in enabling bridge mode or can guide you through placing their router in DMZ mode, which effectively forwards all traffic to your own router.

### 4. **Request a Static Public IP**
   - **Why It Matters:** If you rely on external access to your network (e.g., for **Cloudflare Tunnels** or remote access to your home server), ask your ISP if they can assign a **static public IP**. This ensures that your external IP address doesn’t change, making it easier to maintain consistent connections and configurations.
   - **Potential ISP Response:** Many ISPs can provide a static IP for an extra fee, which is often more reliable for advanced networking needs. Having a static public IP can also simplify configuring your own router and connecting external services.

### 5. **Keep the Same Router and Deco Mesh Setup**
   - **Bring Your Own Router (BYOR):** If you plan to stay with the same ISP, see if you can **bring your existing router and Deco mesh** setup to the new location. This way, even if the ISP has to change some aspects of the connection, your internal network remains consistent.
   - **Ask for Advanced Configuration Options:**
     - Some ISPs allow more flexibility if you use your own equipment (routers, modems, mesh systems). Confirm if they support **BYOR policies** or can assist you in configuring the new setup to match your current network design.

### 6. **Be Prepared for Some Variation**
   - **ISP-Specific Equipment:** Keep in mind that even with the best planning, there might be some variation depending on the equipment and network setup available at the new location. If the ISP uses a different type of router or modem, it may impact how easily you can replicate your current setup.
   - **Discuss Ahead of Time:** Reach out to the ISP **before the move** to explain your requirements and ask what they can do to assist. This will give you time to adjust your plans if needed.

### Summary
It’s worth discussing your network requirements with your ISP when planning to move. Some ISPs can accommodate requests to **replicate LAN IP settings**, **enable bridge mode or DMZ**, and **provide static IP addresses**, but their willingness and ability to do so can vary. If your ISP offers **business plans**, they might be more flexible with customization. Always communicate your needs in advance and ask if **bringing your own router** is an option to maintain consistency in your internal network configuration.
