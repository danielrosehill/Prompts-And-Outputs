**Prompt Summary:** You are interested in tools focused on visualizing the LAN for monitoring purposes, and you find Uptime Kuma to be a suitable option. You are asking if there are other similar tools that are particularly good at visualizing the local network.

---

If you're looking for solutions specifically aimed at visualizing and monitoring the LAN, here are some additional tools that can provide visual network mapping, along with monitoring capabilities:

### 1. **Zabbix**
   - **Description:** Zabbix is a robust network monitoring tool that can also map and visualize your network. It provides extensive monitoring features, including tracking device status, network bandwidth, and visual network topology maps.
   - **Features:**
     - **Visual Network Maps:** Create maps to show connections between devices, including wired, wireless, and virtual connections.
     - **Real-Time Monitoring:** Track device status, IPs, operating systems, and resource usage.
     - **Highly Configurable:** Set up alerts, custom dashboards, and more.
   - **Installation:** Use Docker Compose for easy deployment:
     ```bash
     docker run --name zabbix-appliance -t \
       -p 80:80 -p 10051:10051 zabbix/zabbix-appliance:alpine-6.0-latest
     ```
   - **Recommendation:** Zabbix is a bit more complex to set up but offers extensive visualization and monitoring features.

### 2. **PRTG Network Monitor (via Paessler PRTG Desktop)**
   - **Description:** PRTG is a comprehensive network monitoring tool that can be installed as a server and accessed via a web UI. It’s known for creating network topology maps that show how devices are connected and offer visual insights into traffic, status, and performance.
   - **Features:**
     - **Automatic Network Maps:** Automatically generates maps that display device connections.
     - **Web-Based Dashboard:** Monitor all devices with customizable widgets and real-time updates.
     - **Cross-Platform Access:** Access from any device with a browser, plus native apps for mobile.
   - **Installation:** PRTG can be run on Linux using Docker but is mainly a Windows-based tool. You might need to run it in a Windows VM or use an alternative web front end.

### 3. **Nagios Core + Nagvis**
   - **Description:** Nagios Core is a powerful monitoring tool, and **Nagvis** is an add-on that provides visualizations of the network. Together, they allow you to see a real-time view of your network with detailed information on each device.
   - **Features:**
     - **Custom Maps:** Create visual representations of your network layout, including wired and wireless devices.
     - **Monitor Device Status:** Track device uptime, IP addresses, and various performance metrics.
     - **Web UI:** Access monitoring data and visual maps from a web interface.
   - **Installation Example:**
     ```bash
     docker run --name nagios -p 8080:80 jasonrivers/nagios
     ```
   - **Recommendation:** This combination is flexible and highly customizable but can be a bit complex to set up.

### 4. **NetXMS**
   - **Description:** NetXMS is an enterprise-grade monitoring and management tool that can automatically discover and map your network. It provides a highly visual way of seeing device connections, network routes, and overall infrastructure health.
   - **Features:**
     - **Automatic Topology Mapping:** Automatically detects and maps your network devices.
     - **Real-Time Monitoring and Alerts:** Monitor network usage, bandwidth, and device status.
     - **Web UI & Dashboard:** Highly customizable interface with detailed visualizations.
   - **Installation:** NetXMS offers a Docker installation guide that you can follow for a quick setup.

### 5. **Lansweeper**
   - **Description:** Lansweeper is an asset management and network discovery tool that maps your LAN, showing detailed information about each device. It’s more geared towards inventory and mapping than real-time monitoring but can be helpful for keeping track of everything connected to your network.
   - **Features:**
     - **Network Mapping:** Automatically discovers and visualizes connected devices.
     - **Detailed Device Info:** See OS, IP, MAC address, manufacturer, and more.
     - **Centralized Web UI:** Access from any device for easy network overview.
   - **Note:** Typically run on Windows, but can be set up in a Windows VM if needed.

### **Recommendation**
Given that you want strong visualization capabilities:
- **Zabbix** is a top pick for visual maps and comprehensive monitoring, but it requires a bit more setup.
- **Nagios Core + Nagvis** can provide good visual mapping and is very customizable, though it is also a bit technical.
- **PRTG** offers excellent visualizations out of the box but might require a Windows environment.

If you prefer sticking to a Linux-based setup and need something easier to deploy, **Uptime Kuma** paired with manual Nmap scans or **Netdata** can still give you valuable insights, though with less emphasis on detailed network topology maps.
