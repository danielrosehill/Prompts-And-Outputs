Summary of your prompt: You have a Cloudflare tunnel set up to connect to a server running Home Assistant on your local network. It works fine except when you're on the LAN itself, and you're looking for ideas why this happens.

This issue could occur because the Cloudflare tunnel may not handle local traffic as expected when you're on the same LAN as the Home Assistant server. Here are a few ideas why:

1. Split DNS Issue: On your LAN, DNS requests might resolve the internal IP of the Home Assistant server (e.g., 192.168.1.3) rather than routing through the Cloudflare tunnel. This results in different routes for the same service when you’re inside the network versus outside. You could configure a local DNS override or use a tool like dnsmasq to ensure consistent resolution through the tunnel both on and off the LAN.


2. Routing Conflict: Traffic originating from inside your LAN might be routed directly to Home Assistant’s internal IP without hitting the Cloudflare tunnel. This can cause issues if the tunnel is set to serve specific routes. You could investigate setting up hairpin NAT (also called NAT loopback), which allows devices within the LAN to connect to the public address and route back internally through the tunnel.


3. Firewall Settings: Your LAN firewall might be blocking or rerouting traffic differently for local versus external connections. You could check whether any firewall rules are interfering with LAN traffic trying to use the Cloudflare tunnel.


4. Cloudflare DNS: If your domain is using Cloudflare’s DNS, make sure the DNS settings are correctly configured for both external and internal access. You may need to configure DNS on your local router or server to force internal traffic through the same path used by external clients.



You could try testing connectivity to the Cloudflare tunnel using a device on an external network, and then compare it to how it behaves on your LAN.
