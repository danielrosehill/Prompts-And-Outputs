Yes, **Nginx Reverse Proxy (including Nginx Proxy Manager)** can direct traffic to services running on other **local IPs** within your network. This is a common use case when you have services spread across different machines, containers, or IPs within a LAN, and you want to route external traffic to them via a centralized reverse proxy like Nginx.

### How It Works:

- Nginx acts as the reverse proxy and listens for incoming requests.
- Based on the request's **domain name** or **path**, Nginx routes traffic to the appropriate backend service, which can be running on a **different machine** (with a different local IP) in your network.

### Example Scenario:
You have:
- **Nginx Proxy Manager** running on **192.168.1.1**.
- A service running on **192.168.1.5:8080** (for example, a web app).
- Another service running on **192.168.1.10:9090** (for example, a database or another app).

You want to route traffic to these services without exposing them directly to the internet.

### Steps to Set It Up:

1. **Ensure Connectivity**:
   - Make sure that the Nginx server (on **192.168.1.1**) can access the services running on the other local IPs (e.g., **192.168.1.5** and **192.168.1.10**) within your LAN.
   - Check if firewalls or network rules allow connections between the Nginx server and other devices.

2. **Configure a Proxy Host in Nginx Proxy Manager**:

   Hereâ€™s how to do it using **Nginx Proxy Manager**:

   - Log into Nginx Proxy Manager (typically via `http://<your-nginx-server-ip>:81`).
   - Go to **Hosts** > **Proxy Hosts**.
   - Click on **Add Proxy Host**.

3. **Configure Proxy Host for Each Service**:

   For each service, you'll set up a proxy host configuration.

   #### For the service on **192.168.1.5:8080**:
   - **Domain Name**: For example, `app1.yourdomain.com`.
   - **Scheme**: HTTP (if the service on 192.168.1.5 is running HTTP).
   - **Forward Hostname/IP**: Enter `192.168.1.5` (the local IP of the service).
   - **Forward Port**: Enter `8080` (the port the service is running on).
   - Enable **Websockets Support** if needed (for services that rely on WebSocket communication).
   - Go to the **SSL** tab and configure SSL if required (e.g., request a new SSL certificate for the domain via Let's Encrypt).

   #### For the service on **192.168.1.10:9090**:
   - Follow the same steps as above, but change the domain name, hostname, and port accordingly.
   - **Domain Name**: For example, `app2.yourdomain.com`.
   - **Forward Hostname/IP**: `192.168.1.10`.
   - **Forward Port**: `9090`.

4. **Enable SSL (Optional but Recommended)**:
   - In each proxy host configuration, go to the **SSL** tab.
   - Enable **Force SSL** and **Request a new SSL certificate** if you want to serve traffic securely via HTTPS.
   - Nginx Proxy Manager will handle SSL certificates via Let's Encrypt.

5. **Save the Proxy Host Configuration**:
   - Once the configurations are saved, Nginx Proxy Manager will route traffic for `app1.yourdomain.com` to **192.168.1.5:8080**, and traffic for `app2.yourdomain.com` to **192.168.1.10:9090**.

### Testing:
- You can test by navigating to `http://app1.yourdomain.com` or `https://app1.yourdomain.com`, and it should route traffic to the service on **192.168.1.5:8080**.
- Similarly, test for `app2.yourdomain.com`.

### Example Use Cases:
- You may have a **web app** running on one local IP and a **database** or **API service** running on another.
- All traffic can go through Nginx, allowing you to handle SSL termination, logging, and access controls centrally.

### Alternative: Manual Nginx Configuration (without NPM):
If you're not using **Nginx Proxy Manager** and prefer to manually configure Nginx, you can directly edit the Nginx configuration file (usually `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` or a separate file in `/etc/nginx/sites-available/`).

Here's an example of a manual Nginx configuration to proxy to another local IP:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name app1.yourdomain.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://192.168.1.5:8080;  # Forward to local IP
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    }
}

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name app2.yourdomain.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://192.168.1.10:9090;  # Forward to another local IP
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    }
}
```

After adding this configuration, reload Nginx:

```bash
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

### Summary:

- **Nginx Proxy Manager** (or Nginx itself) can absolutely proxy traffic to services running on other local IP addresses in your network.
- This setup allows you to centralize traffic management, handle SSL, and provide secure access to multiple services running across different machines or containers in your LAN.
- You can route traffic based on **domain names** or **paths** while keeping all services behind the same Nginx reverse proxy.
  
This is particularly useful in scenarios where services are distributed across multiple devices in your network.
