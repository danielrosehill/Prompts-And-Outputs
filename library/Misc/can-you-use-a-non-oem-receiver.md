No, you cannot use a non-OEM receiver with a Logitech keyboard that uses the **Logitech Unifying Receiver**. Logitech's Unifying Receiver uses proprietary technology that is only compatible with Logitech devices that support the Unifying Receiver.

### Key Points:
- **Logitech Unifying Receivers** are designed to pair only with Logitech devices that support the Unifying technology (marked with the orange Unifying logo).
- **Non-OEM (non-Logitech) receivers** do not support the same pairing protocol and therefore wonâ€™t work with Logitech devices, even if they use a similar 2.4 GHz frequency.
  
### Solution:
If you've lost your original Unifying Receiver, you can:
- **Purchase another Unifying Receiver**: Logitech sells standalone Unifying Receivers that you can buy and pair with your existing devices.
- **Pair Multiple Devices to One Receiver**: You can also pair up to six Logitech Unifying-compatible devices (like keyboards, mice, etc.) to a single Unifying Receiver using the **Logitech Unifying Software** or **Solaar** on Linux.

Let me know if you need help with pairing or finding a replacement receiver!
