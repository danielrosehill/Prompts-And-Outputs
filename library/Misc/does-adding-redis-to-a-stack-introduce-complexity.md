Adding Redis to a stack that includes PostgreSQL and your application (like Outline) does introduce some complexity, but it can be quite manageable and beneficial. Here's a breakdown of the considerations and how it affects your deployment:

### Benefits of Adding Redis
1. **Performance Improvement**:
   - **Caching**: Redis is often used as a caching layer, significantly speeding up access to frequently queried data. This can reduce load times and enhance user experience.
   - **Session Management**: It can store session data and authentication tokens, which can make user sessions more efficient and faster.

2. **Scalability**:
   - Using Redis allows for scalable architectures, especially if your application grows or if you start handling multiple users. It helps balance load and distribute resource usage.

### Complexity Considerations
1. **Deployment**:
   - **Installation**: Installing Redis alongside your application and PostgreSQL adds another component to manage. However, Redis is lightweight and relatively straightforward to set up, especially if you're using Docker.
   - **Configuration**: You'll need to configure Redis to communicate with your application. This usually involves setting connection parameters in your application configuration files.

2. **Maintenance**:
   - **Monitoring and Maintenance**: You’ll need to monitor Redis for performance metrics, such as memory usage, cache hit/miss ratios, and overall performance. This adds a layer of operational overhead.
   - **Backup Strategy**: While PostgreSQL will handle backups, you’ll also need to consider how to back up Redis data if necessary (though Redis is often ephemeral).

3. **Development Considerations**:
   - If you’re integrating Redis into your application logic, you may need to modify your application code to use Redis effectively, which could involve learning about caching strategies and session handling.

4. **Network Configuration**:
   - Ensure that the network configuration allows your application to communicate with Redis securely, especially if they're running on separate containers or VMs.

### Conclusion
While adding Redis does introduce some complexity, its benefits often outweigh the downsides, especially for performance and scalability. If you're using Docker, the complexity can be further minimized through Docker Compose, allowing you to manage Redis alongside your other services easily.

If you're deploying for personal use and the application load is low, you might find that starting without Redis is perfectly acceptable. You can always add it later as your needs evolve.
