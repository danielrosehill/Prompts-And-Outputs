Title: "Datapoint search: air pollution, by company, 2023"
---

You asked about companies that may have voluntarily disclosed data on air pollution emissions in 2023, based on the parameters in the provided dataset (e.g., PM2.5, SOx, NH3, PM10, NOx, VOC). Several companies and regions have been actively reporting or were required to disclose emissions data in 2023. Here are some examples:

### 1. Tesla

Tesla's 2023 impact report revealed significant data on its greenhouse gas emissions, which increased by nearly 10 million metric tons of CO2 compared to the previous year. Tesla has been voluntarily disclosing its emissions as part of its sustainability efforts, although much of the focus has been on carbon dioxide (CO2) rather than specific pollutants like PM2.5 or NOx. However, Tesla's reporting is part of broader environmental transparency that could include air pollutants in future disclosures\[2].

### 2. European Union Companies

In 2023, the EU introduced new sustainability reporting standards under the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), which require companies to disclose their air pollution emissions. These standards apply to over 50,000 businesses starting from the 2024 financial year but would have prompted many companies to begin preparing their disclosures in 2023\[3]. This would include pollutants like PM2.5, SOx, and NOx.

### 3. Indonesian Utility PLN

In Indonesia, state-owned utility PLN was ordered by the Public Information Commission to disclose emissions data for some of its largest coal-fired power plants in 2023. This decision marked a significant step toward greater transparency in air pollution data by a major emitter of pollutants such as SOx and NOx\[6].

### 4. Toray Group

Toray Group, a chemical company, has been actively reducing and disclosing its volatile organic compounds (VOC) emissions as part of its CSR Roadmap 2025. In 2023, it continued efforts to reduce VOCs and other air pollutants like those specified under Japan's Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (PRTR) Law\[9].

### 5. Minnesota Facilities

In Minnesota, facilities with air permits voluntarily report emissions of air toxics every three years, including hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) such as VOCs and NOx. While not mandatory for all pollutants in every year, many facilities likely reported their emissions in 2023 as part of this cycle\[7].

These examples show how companies across different sectors and regions are increasingly disclosing air pollution data voluntarily or due to regulatory requirements.
