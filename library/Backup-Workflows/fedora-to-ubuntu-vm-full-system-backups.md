# Prompt

I have an Ubuntu server on my LAN at 192.168.1.5.
I'd like to create incremental backups of my Fedora computer 
I would like these backups to be full system backups - although I would want to exclude a few directories like /mnt
The purpose of these backups would be to be able to restore the system onto new hardware if required (after the OS has already been reinstalled).
I'd like a backup tool that is easy to administer, so a GUI would be preferable. The backups should run automatically once a week. 
Please suggest some appropriate solutions and describe how to implement them

# Output

Here are some GUI-based solutions suitable for creating full system incremental backups from your Fedora computer to your Ubuntu server, which can be scheduled to run weekly:

### 1. **Veeam Agent for Linux**
   - **Description**: Veeam Agent is a powerful, user-friendly backup tool with a GUI that can perform full system backups, including incremental updates. It supports automated scheduling and restoration to different hardware.
   - **Pros**: Easy to set up and manage with a graphical interface. Supports incremental backups, encryption, and scheduling. Can restore the system to new hardware.
   - **Cons**: Proprietary software, but free for personal use.
   
#### Implementation:
1. **Install Veeam Agent**:
   - On **Fedora**:
     1. Download the Veeam Agent package from [Veeam's website](https://www.veeam.com/linux-backup-free.html).
     2. Follow the installation instructions provided on the website.
   - On **Ubuntu server**:
     Ensure the destination folder where the backups will be stored is ready and accessible via SSH.

2. **Configure Veeam Agent**:
   - Launch the Veeam Agent GUI on Fedora.
   - Create a new backup job, selecting the entire system for backup.
   - Specify the Ubuntu server as the destination:
     - Use an SSH connection (`user@192.168.1.5:/path/to/backup-folder`).
     - Provide authentication and ensure SSH keys are configured if needed.
   - Set up exclusions for directories you do not want to back up (e.g., `/mnt`).
   - Schedule the backup to run weekly.

3. **Automate Backups**:
   - Veeam's GUI allows for easy scheduling, ensuring backups run automatically.

4. **Restoration**:
   - If you need to restore, Veeam allows you to create bootable recovery media. You can use it to restore the backup to new hardware.

### 2. **UrBackup**
   - **Description**: UrBackup is an open-source backup solution with a web-based GUI. It supports full and incremental backups and can be configured to back up over a network.
   - **Pros**: Open-source, web interface for managing backups, supports incremental backups and easy setup.
   - **Cons**: More suitable for network environments, requires setting up both server and client components.

#### Implementation:
1. **Set Up UrBackup Server on Ubuntu**:
   - Install the server on your Ubuntu VM:
     ```bash
     sudo apt install urbackup-server
     ```
   - Access the web GUI at `http://192.168.1.5:55414`.

2. **Install UrBackup Client on Fedora**:
   - Download and install the client from the [UrBackup website](https://www.urbackup.org/).
   - During setup, specify the server address (`192.168.1.5`) and configure the directories to back up.
   - Exclude unwanted directories like `/mnt`.

3. **Configure Backup Jobs via Web GUI**:
   - Log into the UrBackup web interface.
   - Create a new backup job for the Fedora client, ensuring itâ€™s set for full backups with incremental updates.
   - Schedule it to run weekly.

4. **Restoration**:
   - UrBackup allows easy file restoration through the web GUI or full recovery if you need to restore the system onto new hardware.

### 3. **Timeshift + Rsync Setup with GUI**
   - **Description**: While Timeshift is typically used for creating system snapshots, combining it with rsync and a manual configuration can allow you to back up full systems to remote destinations. The Timeshift GUI makes it easier to manage settings and schedules.
   - **Pros**: Integrated with many Linux environments, GUI for easy management, can use rsync to push backups to the Ubuntu server.
   - **Cons**: Primarily meant for local backups, so requires a bit of configuration for remote setups.

#### Implementation:
1. **Install Timeshift**:
   - On **Fedora**:
     ```bash
     sudo dnf install timeshift
     ```
   
2. **Configure Timeshift**:
   - Launch Timeshift and set it up to take snapshots of your system, excluding directories like `/mnt`.
   - Configure rsync as the backup type.

3. **Automate Transfer with Cron and Rsync**:
   - Set up a cron job to regularly use rsync to transfer Timeshift snapshots to your Ubuntu server.
   - Example rsync command:
     ```bash
     rsync -avz /timeshift/snapshots user@192.168.1.5:/path/to/backup-folder
     ```

4. **Schedule Automatic Snapshots**:
   - Use the Timeshift GUI to schedule weekly snapshots.

5. **Restoration**:
   - Timeshift provides tools to restore snapshots to a fresh install, though transferring to new hardware may involve more manual steps.

### Recommendation:
**Veeam Agent for Linux** is the best fit if you want an easy-to-administer solution with a clean GUI, straightforward scheduling, and comprehensive system recovery capabilities. For an open-source solution, **UrBackup** offers a reliable web-based interface that can handle full system backups and incremental updates over the network. Both solutions will allow you to set up automated weekly backups and manage them easily.
