Got it! Here are some suggested paths on your **Ubuntu VM** where you can send and store your desktop backups over the local network:

### 1. **/srv/backups/desktop**
   - **Description**: This path follows a structured approach, using `/srv`, which is typically designated for server-related data storage. Creating a `backups` directory inside `/srv` with a subdirectory for `desktop` makes it clear and organized.
   - **Example**:
     ```bash
     /srv/backups/desktop
     ```
   - **Pros**: Clean and organized, easy to manage. Reflects a common server directory structure.

### 2. **/mnt/backup-vault/desktop-backups**
   - **Description**: Since you're considering setting up a "vault," using `/mnt` for mounted backup storage is logical. You can create a subdirectory specifically for desktop backups.
   - **Example**:
     ```bash
     /mnt/backup-vault/desktop-backups
     ```
   - **Pros**: Keeps all backup-related data under a designated vault location. Clear separation from system data.

### 3. **/data/backups/desktop**
   - **Description**: If your server has a dedicated data partition or volume, you might want to use `/data` as the root for backups. Creating a specific path under `/data` helps in distinguishing backups from other data services.
   - **Example**:
     ```bash
     /data/backups/desktop
     ```
   - **Pros**: Ideal for servers with separate data partitions. Provides flexibility for managing large amounts of data.

### 4. **/var/backups/desktop**
   - **Description**: The `/var/backups` directory is commonly used for backup storage. You can add a dedicated `desktop` subdirectory.
   - **Example**:
     ```bash
     /var/backups/desktop
     ```
   - **Pros**: Following a traditional server layout. Easily identifiable as a backup location.

### 5. **/home/backup-user/desktop**
   - **Description**: If you'd like to manage permissions more tightly, consider creating a specific user (e.g., `backup-user`) and store backups in that user's home directory. This method makes it easier to control access.
   - **Example**:
     ```bash
     /home/backup-user/desktop
     ```
   - **Pros**: Clear user management, simple to secure and manage via SSH permissions.

### Recommendation:
Using **`/srv/backups/desktop`** or **`/mnt/backup-vault/desktop-backups`** would provide a clear, structured way to manage backups. Both options are intuitive and ensure that backup data is stored separately from other system and user data.
