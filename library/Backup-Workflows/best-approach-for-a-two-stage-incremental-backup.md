# Prompt

Are any of the approaches more suitable for a "chained" backup approach. What I mean by that: the main backup is over the LAN. And once that backup is finished, the LAN target will automatically start an incremental backup to the cloud?

# Output

Based on the search results and your specific query about a "chained" backup approach, here's a consolidated answer:

A "chained" backup approach, where you first backup to a local target over LAN and then that local target backs up to the cloud, is indeed possible and can be quite effective. This approach is sometimes referred to as a "tiered" or "hybrid" backup strategy. Here's an analysis of the options that would work well for this scenario:

1. Restic
Ease of Implementation: Moderate

Restic is particularly well-suited for this chained approach:
- It supports multiple backend types, including local storage and various cloud providers.
- You can easily set up two separate backup jobs: one from your Fedora desktop to the Ubuntu VM, and another from the Ubuntu VM to B2 or another cloud storage.
- Restic uses its own efficient, encrypted format, which works well for both local and cloud storage.

2. Borg Backup + Rclone
Ease of Implementation: Moderate to Advanced

This combination can effectively achieve the chained backup:
- Use Borg for the initial backup from Fedora to Ubuntu VM (efficient, encrypted, deduplication).
- Use Rclone to sync the Borg repository to B2 or another cloud storage.
- Rclone supports efficient syncing and can be configured to only upload changed files.

3. Rsnapshot + Rclone
Ease of Implementation: Moderate

Rsnapshot, built on rsync, offers a good balance for this approach:
- Use Rsnapshot for efficient, incremental backups from Fedora to Ubuntu VM.
- Rsnapshot creates multiple snapshot points, which is beneficial for local recovery.
- Use Rclone to sync the Rsnapshot backup directory to cloud storage.

4. Custom Script using Rsync + Cloud CLI tool
Ease of Implementation: Advanced

For more control, you could create a custom script:
- Use rsync for the initial backup to the Ubuntu VM.
- Use a cloud storage CLI tool (like B2 CLI) to sync changed files to the cloud.
- This approach requires more scripting but offers maximum flexibility.

Comparison Matrix for Chained Backup Approach:

| Solution           | Local Efficiency | Cloud Integration | Encryption | Ease of Use |
|--------------------|-------------------|-------------------|------------|-------------|
| Restic             | ★★★★              | ★★★★★              | ★★★★★       | ★★★         |
| Borg + Rclone      | ★★★★★             | ★★★★               | ★★★★★       | ★★          |
| Rsnapshot + Rclone | ★★★★              | ★★★★               | ★★★         | ★★★         |
| Custom (Rsync+CLI) | ★★★               | ★★★★               | ★★★         | ★           |

★ = Poor, ★★★★★ = Excellent

Recommendation:
For your chained backup approach, Restic or the combination of Borg + Rclone would be the most suitable options. They offer efficient local backups, good cloud integration, and built-in encryption. Restic might be slightly easier to set up for this specific use case, while Borg + Rclone offers more flexibility if you need to customize the process further.
