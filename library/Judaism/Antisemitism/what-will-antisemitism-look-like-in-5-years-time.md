# Prompt

Since the atrocities of October 7th, the world has witnessed a rise in antisemitism. Can you summarise the change in attitudes towards Jews between October 7th 2023 and October 7th 2024. Try to summarise this change in attitudes towards the acceptability of antisemitism as best as you can. Then, try to extrapolate five years into the future. In other words, if the current trends we are witnessing towards antisemitism continue unabated, what kind of climate to antisemitism can we expect to encounter in 5 years time?

# Output

Between October 7th, 2023, and October 7th, 2024, the world has seen a **sharp rise in antisemitism**, fueled by the tragic events of October 7th, 2023, and the ensuing geopolitical conflicts, particularly in the Middle East. The change in attitudes during this period has been marked by:

### **1. Increased Visibility of Antisemitism in Public Discourse**
Following the October 7th attacks and subsequent conflicts involving Israel, there was a significant surge in antisemitic incidents globally. These included violent attacks, vandalism, and the use of antisemitic tropes in protests and on social media. **Antisemitic rhetoric**, previously seen as taboo or confined to fringe groups, became more visible and, alarmingly, more normalized in some mainstream discussions. Some groups, particularly in the context of anti-Israel sentiment, conflated legitimate criticisms of Israeli policies with antisemitic language and behavior.

### **2. Weakening of Boundaries Between Anti-Israel and Antisemitic Sentiments**
Throughout this year, the distinction between **anti-Zionism** and antisemitism has blurred. While criticism of Israel’s policies is legitimate, there was a growing trend of using Israel as a proxy to express **age-old antisemitic stereotypes**, such as accusations of global Jewish control, economic power, and conspiracies. In many protests, "Free Palestine" chants were paired with explicit antisemitic rhetoric, making it harder to separate political critique from hate.

### **3. Normalization of Antisemitism in Social Movements**
Antisemitism found fertile ground in **some activist circles**, particularly within social justice and leftist movements, where it was rationalized as part of broader anti-imperialist or anti-colonial stances. This year saw growing **marginalization of Jewish voices** within these movements, with some Jewish individuals being told that their support for Israel made them complicit in oppression, while others were pressured to denounce Israel to remain included in these spaces.

### **4. Institutional Responses Lagging Behind**
Governments and institutions struggled to respond effectively to this resurgence in antisemitism. While many **denounced** the rise in hate crimes, there was **limited decisive action** taken to curb the growing problem, particularly on social media platforms where antisemitic content proliferated. In some cases, authorities faced criticism for downplaying the gravity of antisemitic incidents or failing to acknowledge the antisemitic underpinnings of certain protests or acts of violence.

### **5. Fractured Jewish Communities**
As antisemitism intensified, **Jewish communities globally became more anxious**, with increased security concerns for synagogues, schools, and community centers. There was a noticeable shift in public behavior among Jewish populations, with many feeling the need to conceal their identity in public spaces for fear of harassment or violence. This also led to a broader sense of **alienation** and frustration as many Jews found that their concerns were dismissed or overshadowed by broader political conflicts.

### **Extrapolation: Antisemitism in 5 Years (2029)**
If the current trends continue unabated, by **2029** the climate surrounding antisemitism could become much more severe:

### **1. Mainstreaming of Antisemitic Tropes**
If left unchecked, antisemitism could become **more normalized in mainstream political and social discourse**. Antisemitic ideas, masked as critiques of Israel or Zionism, could become entrenched in public debates. **Conspiracy theories** about Jewish control of media, finance, and politics could become more openly discussed, even in academic and policy settings, with less social stigma attached to those who espouse them.

### **2. Institutional Marginalization of Jewish Voices**
Jewish communities may feel increasingly **marginalized** in various institutional settings, from universities to social movements. There could be a trend of **excluding Jewish voices** from important conversations, particularly on issues related to Israel and the Middle East, unless they conform to certain political views that reject Israel’s legitimacy. This exclusion could worsen, leading to a **further breakdown** in interfaith and intercultural dialogue.

### **3. Increasingly Hostile Public Environment**
The **physical threat** to Jews could increase, with more frequent violent attacks on Jewish individuals, schools, synagogues, and businesses. In some parts of the world, Jewish populations may **diminish** due to migration to safer areas or countries where they feel more protected. Public displays of Jewish identity, such as wearing a kippah or displaying a mezuzah, may become increasingly rare due to safety concerns.

### **4. Social Media Becoming a Hotbed for Hate**
With **limited regulation** or oversight on platforms, social media could become even more dominated by antisemitic content, with **hate speech normalized** in everyday discussions. Algorithms that prioritize engagement might continue to amplify divisive and inflammatory content, making antisemitism harder to combat and more widespread, particularly among younger generations exposed to extremist content online.

### **5. Deterioration of Israel’s Diplomatic Relations**
The **international isolation of Israel** could deepen, with more countries, including in the West, adopting increasingly hostile stances toward the state. This might lead to **political isolation** of Jewish communities who are seen as defending or aligning with Israel. Support for policies like the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement could grow, further **ostracizing Jews** in political and economic sectors.

### **Conclusion: A Pivotal Moment for Antisemitism**
The period between 2023 and 2024 marked a troubling rise in antisemitism globally, with significant implications for how Jews are perceived and treated. If the current trends are not actively addressed, the next five years could witness a **further deterioration** of the climate surrounding antisemitism, leading to widespread marginalization of Jewish communities, the normalization of hate, and an erosion of social cohesion. It is critical that this rise in antisemitism be confronted with **meaningful policy, education, and dialogue** before it escalates further.
