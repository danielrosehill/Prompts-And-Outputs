Antisemites often rely on the support of certain Jewish voices who share critical or hostile views toward Israel to defend themselves against accusations of antisemitism. This tactic is based on the idea that if a Jewish person holds a similar opinion, then the stance cannot be considered antisemitic. However, the endorsement of a minority group of Jewish individuals does not absolve or diminish the prejudice or harm of the viewpoint. Here are some examples and observations that illustrate this pattern:

1. **The “Good Jew” Trope**: Some critics of Israel amplify the voices of Jewish individuals or groups who harshly criticize Israel or endorse anti-Zionist positions, often referring to them as "the good Jews." By emphasizing the views of these individuals, antisemites attempt to legitimize their broader anti-Jewish sentiments. For example, platforms like IfNotNow and Jewish Voice for Peace, which critique Israeli policies, are frequently cited by non-Jewish groups and individuals with extreme anti-Israel views as “proof” that their criticism is valid and not rooted in antisemitism.

2. **Selective Amplification of Minority Jewish Views**: There are diverse perspectives within the Jewish community, including those critical of Israeli policies. However, antisemites often selectively amplify the views of a small subset of Jewish critics who align with their own anti-Israel or anti-Jewish narratives, disregarding the broader spectrum of Jewish opinion. This selective endorsement falsely suggests a consensus within the Jewish community, painting Jews who support Israel or Zionism as an outlier or even complicit in perceived wrongdoings. This tactic creates a polarized narrative and fails to reflect the complexities of Jewish identity and beliefs.

3. **Weaponizing Jewish Voices to Justify Harmful Rhetoric**: Public figures accused of antisemitism may deflect criticism by citing Jewish individuals who publicly support their views, using these endorsements as a shield. An example of this was seen with certain public figures during controversies involving antisemitic remarks; they defended themselves by highlighting Jewish individuals who validated their statements, as if this validation negated the inherent antisemitism in their words. These cases illustrate that the support of a few does not absolve harmful rhetoric aimed at a group as a whole.

4. **Ignoring Broader Jewish Rejection of Antisemitic Rhetoric**: The broader Jewish community frequently condemns antisemitic rhetoric and actions, even when they come from people who claim to have Jewish supporters. However, such condemnations are often dismissed or ignored in favor of highlighting dissenting voices that seem to agree with the antisemite’s agenda. This selective listening disregards the overwhelming consensus within Jewish communities that denounces antisemitism, regardless of individuals who may deviate from this norm.

5. **Historical Precedent**: The use of a minority within a community to justify broader prejudice has historical roots. In Europe during the 20th century, some regimes promoted Jewish individuals who were willing to cooperate or speak against other Jews as examples of “good Jews,” thus creating an internal division and suggesting that antisemitic policies had Jewish backing. This historical context highlights how relying on minority endorsement to justify prejudice is a longstanding strategy to deflect from broader racist or antisemitic intentions.

In summary, citing a minority of Jewish individuals who endorse extreme anti-Israel or anti-Jewish views does not negate the antisemitism underlying such positions. Antisemites use this approach to give their rhetoric a veneer of credibility and neutrality, but it fails to address or mitigate the prejudiced impact of their views on the Jewish community as a whole.
