The thesis that the Irish government has failed in its responsibilities to prevent the virulent anti-Israel sentiment in Ireland from crossing into antisemitism is supported by several specific examples and trends. These examples indicate that hate speech, including antisemitic canards, often goes unchecked, and Ireland may indeed be derelict in its responsibilities at the European Union (EU) level.

### Irish Anti-Israel Sentiment and its Overlap with Antisemitism

Ireland is widely regarded as one of the most anti-Israel countries within the EU. This sentiment is often indistinguishable from outright antisemitism, as evidenced by various incidents and statements from Irish politicians and public figures. For instance, Sinn Féin lawmakers have made overtly antisemitic remarks, such as Martin Browne claiming that Israel created ISIS and Reada Cronin suggesting that H was a pawn of the Rothschilds—an age-old antisemitic trope. These statements were not seriously challenged or condemned by the broader political establishment, effectively normalizing such rhetoric\[6].

Furthermore, Ireland's political hostility toward Israel is reflected in its legislative actions. The Irish parliament has debated bills aimed at boycotting Israeli businesses operating in disputed territories like Judea and Samaria. While these measures are framed as critiques of Israeli policy, they are often accompanied by antisemitic undertones from their proponents\[6].

### Unchecked Hate Speech and Antisemitic Canards

The rise in antisemitism in Ireland has not been adequately addressed by the government or educational institutions. Reports indicate that Jewish students face harassment, including jokes about the Holocaust and even being handed recordings of Hitler’s speeches\[3]. These incidents are often brushed off by school authorities, suggesting a lack of serious engagement with the issue. Moreover, pro-Palestinian demonstrations organized shortly after Hamas's attacks on Israel in October 2023 further exacerbated tensions. The absence of a pro-Israel voice in public discourse has allowed antisemitic views to flourish unchecked\[3].

This trend is not limited to schools but extends to universities and public life. The Jewish Representative Council of Ireland has noted that antisemitism has become more overt since October 2023, with boycotts of Israeli businesses and products being openly promoted\[3]. This reflects a broader societal shift where criticism of Israel frequently crosses into antisemitism, with little governmental intervention to curb this trend.

### Ireland's Dereliction at the EU Level

At the EU level, Ireland stands out for its failure to adopt comprehensive measures to combat antisemitism. Unlike most other EU member states, Ireland has not endorsed the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) definition of antisemitism at the government level\[4]. This definition explicitly includes certain forms of anti-Zionism as manifestations of antisemitism, making it a crucial tool for distinguishing legitimate criticism of Israeli policies from hate speech targeting Jews.

In contrast to Ireland's inaction, many other EU countries have taken significant steps to combat antisemitism. For example:

- **Germany** has appointed antisemitism commissioners at both federal and state levels to ensure consistent legal responses to antisemitic offenses\[5].
- **Austria** introduced a "Package of Measures Against Antisemitism" after October 2023 to combat disinformation online and increase cooperation between government agencies and tech platforms\[5].
- **Sweden** established a task force specifically aimed at fostering Jewish life and preventing antisemitism\[5].

These examples highlight how other nations have taken a proactive stance in curbing antisemitism while ensuring that criticism of Israel does not devolve into hate speech against Jews. Ireland’s failure to implement similar strategies suggests a dereliction of responsibility both domestically and within the broader EU framework.

### Comparison with Other Nations

Countries like **Germany** and **Austria**, with their historical responsibility for the Holocaust, have developed robust frameworks to combat both antisemitism and anti-Israel rhetoric that crosses into hate speech against Jews. Germany’s legal system ensures that public prosecutors coordinate investigations into antisemitic crimes, while Austria’s measures focus on combating online disinformation\[5]. These nations have recognized that unchecked criticism of Israel can lead to an unsafe environment for Jewish communities.

In contrast, Ireland’s approach has been far more passive. Despite rising levels of antisemitic incidents—both online and offline—the Irish government has not introduced significant legislative or educational reforms aimed at addressing this issue. Instead, anti-Israel sentiment continues to dominate public discourse without sufficient counter-narratives or protections for Jewish citizens\[6].

### Conclusion

The Irish government has indeed failed in its responsibilities to prevent anti-Israel sentiment from crossing into outright antisemitism. Hate speech targeting Jews frequently goes unchecked, particularly when it is cloaked in anti-Zionist rhetoric. Compared to other EU nations that have taken stronger measures against such trends, Ireland stands out for its lack of action both domestically and at the EU level. This dereliction leaves Jewish communities vulnerable to harassment and discrimination while allowing harmful stereotypes about Jews to persist unchallenged.
