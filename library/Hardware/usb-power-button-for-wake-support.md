# Prompt

I'd like to have an easy way to wake my computer from a suspend state. I purchased an external button for this purpose but that requires integration with the PSU. I'm wondering if there might be a simpler solution like perhaps just a power button that I can connect via USB. Its sole purpose would be waking the desktop up from suspend. Although putting it into sleep state would be helpful too

# Output

Given your setup and your goal of waking the desktop from a suspend state using a simple external device, here are a few options that could be more practical than integrating a button with your PSU:

### 1. **USB Power Button**
A **USB-connected power button** is an ideal solution that doesnâ€™t require PSU modifications. While some motherboards allow waking via USB, here are steps you can take:

- **Enable USB Wake Support**:  
  Most modern motherboards, including the one in your custom build (Pro B760M-A WiFi), support waking up the computer from suspend via USB. Here's how to enable it:
  
  1. Enter your BIOS/UEFI by pressing **DEL** or **F2** when starting up the computer.
  2. Look for options such as **Wake on USB** or **USB Power after Shutdown**. Make sure these are enabled.
  
- **USB Power Button Devices**:  
  There are specific USB buttons sold for waking up or powering on computers. These typically plug into a USB port and function similarly to the main power button.

### 2. **USB Keyboards/Mouse for Wake-Up**
If you don't mind using existing peripherals, you can configure your keyboard or mouse to wake the computer from suspend. Most modern desktops support this. Here's how:

1. **Enable Wake from USB**: Ensure that USB wake-up support is enabled in the BIOS/UEFI, as mentioned above.
2. **Configure via Fedora**:
   - Open a terminal and run:
     ```bash
     sudo nano /etc/default/grub
     ```
   - Look for the line that begins with `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX`, and add `usbcore.autosuspend=-1` to prevent USB devices from going into deep suspend.
   - Then update your GRUB configuration:
     ```bash
     sudo grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
     ```
   - Finally, run this command to make sure your devices can wake the system:
     ```bash
     sudo sh -c 'echo enabled > /sys/bus/usb/devices/usbX/power/wakeup'
     ```
     Replace `usbX` with the appropriate USB bus number.

### 3. **Wireless Power Button**
Another option is a **wireless power button**, which can work via Bluetooth or Zigbee. These can be paired with the system and configured to act as a wake-up device or even put the system to sleep.

### 4. **Peripheral Control Widgets**
You might also find it helpful to look for external devices specifically designed for power management, such as **USB hubs with power control** or **custom widgets** that send suspend and wake commands over USB.

This approach avoids the complexity of integrating with the PSU and gives you the simplicity of an external button or keyboard shortcut.
