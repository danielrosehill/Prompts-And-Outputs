To summarize: you're asking whether there's a standard way to run a **SATA cable** out of a computer's case and what the maximum length for **SATA III** cables is.

### Running a SATA Cable Outside the Case:

While **SATA cables** are typically used internally, there are a few standard ways to run them outside the case:

#### 1. **SATA to eSATA Adapter**
   - **eSATA** (External SATA) is designed specifically for running SATA connections externally. You can use a **SATA to eSATA bracket** to route a standard SATA cable from your motherboard to the back of your case, where it converts to an **eSATA** port. This allows for a proper external connection without affecting performance.
   - **How it works**: 
     - You connect the internal **SATA port** on the motherboard to the bracket inside the case.
     - The **eSATA port** on the back allows you to connect external drives directly.
   - **Advantage**: This method maintains SATA speeds and is a reliable way to connect external drives without opening the case every time.

   Example:
   - **SATA to eSATA Bracket**: You can find simple brackets that connect a SATA port on your motherboard to an external **eSATA** port on your case.

#### 2. **SATA Port on a Hot-Swap Bay**
   - If your case has a **hot-swap bay**, you can install drives without needing to route cables outside the case. These bays allow you to insert and remove drives directly from the front of the case.
   - **Advantage**: This provides easy access to the drives while keeping them inside the case.

#### 3. **Custom SATA Cable Routing**
   - If you want to route a **SATA cable** directly out of the case (without converting to eSATA), you may need to modify the case by running the cable through an unused PCI slot cover or a custom-made hole in the case. However, this is **not recommended** as the cable is designed for internal use, and the connectors might not be as robust as those designed for external use.

### Maximum Length of SATA III Cables:
- **SATA III (6 Gbps)** cables have a **maximum recommended length of 1 meter (about 3.3 feet)**. Beyond this length, signal degradation may occur, which can result in reduced performance or data integrity issues.
- If you need to connect a drive over a longer distance, consider using **eSATA** or other external connection standards like **USB 3.1/3.2** or **Thunderbolt**.

### Recommendations:
- For a **standard solution** with reliable performance, use a **SATA to eSATA bracket** if you need to run a cable outside the case.
- Keep your **SATA III cable length** under 1 meter to maintain performance.
