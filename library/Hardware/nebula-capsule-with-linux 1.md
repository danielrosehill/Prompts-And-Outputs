# Prompt

The Nebula Capsule is the one I've been looking at. What's the compatibility with Fedora Linux like? Is Miracast the best option or are there others that would work?

# Output

The **Anker Nebula Capsule** is a great choice, and when it comes to compatibility with **Fedora Linux**, here’s what you should know:

### **Miracast Compatibility on Fedora Linux**:
- **Miracast** is the most straightforward option, and it **can work** with Fedora Linux, though it requires a bit of setup. Fedora doesn’t natively support Miracast out-of-the-box, but you can enable it using tools like:
  - **Gnome Network Displays**: This is a GUI app that allows you to stream to Miracast-enabled devices. It’s available in Fedora’s repositories, so you can install it via `dnf`.
  - **MiracleCast**: Another open-source solution that supports Miracast streaming on Linux, though it requires some configuration.

### **Alternative Wireless Streaming Options**:
- **DLNA** (Digital Living Network Alliance): Fedora Linux supports DLNA through software like **VLC** or **MiniDLNA**. The Nebula Capsule can connect to DLNA servers, and you can stream videos and media using a DLNA-compatible media server running on Fedora.
- **Chromecast**: If you use **Google Chrome** or a Chromium-based browser on Fedora, you can cast your screen using a **Chromecast dongle**. The Nebula Capsule doesn’t have Chromecast built-in, but you can use a dongle to achieve this.
- **HDMI with Wireless Adapters**: If wireless streaming proves cumbersome, you can always use a wireless HDMI adapter (like an **AnyCast** dongle), which works similarly to Miracast but bypasses some of the setup issues on Linux.

### Best Option for Fedora Linux:
- **Miracast** via **Gnome Network Displays** or **MiracleCast** is probably your best option for wireless screen mirroring.
- If you primarily stream videos and media files, **DLNA** can be simpler and more reliable for basic streaming needs.

Overall, Fedora’s wireless streaming can require some setup, but with **Miracast** and **DLNA**, you should be able to use the Nebula Capsule effectively.
