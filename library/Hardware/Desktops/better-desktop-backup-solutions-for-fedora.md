# Prompt

These are all very scrappy projects. Are there no commercial backup companies which make workstation protection tools which can support fedora desktops? If so can you recommend some and provide costings?

# Output

Based on your query and the search results provided, there are indeed commercial backup solutions that support Fedora desktops. One notable option is MSP360 (formerly CloudBerry), which offers a comprehensive backup solution for various platforms, including Linux distributions like Fedora.

## MSP360 Backup for Fedora

MSP360 provides a commercial backup solution that supports Fedora and other Linux distributions[2]. Here are some key features and pricing details:

1. **File-level backup**: Allows you to backup specific files and folders[2].

2. **Cloud storage integration**: Supports various cloud storage providers, including Amazon S3, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and others[2].

3. **Flexible pricing options**:
   - Personal Edition: $29.99 per year[4]
   - Server Edition: $109.99 per year[4]
   - Ultimate Edition: $179.99 per year[4]

4. **Advanced features**: Includes compression, encryption, flexible scheduler, and retention policies[2].

5. **Business-oriented options**: The Server and Ultimate editions are designed for business use and offer more advanced capabilities[2].

## Backblaze B2 Integration

MSP360 can be integrated with Backblaze B2 cloud storage for a cost-effective backup solution:

- Backblaze B2 storage costs approximately $5.99 per terabyte per month[3].
- This combination can save up to 80% compared to using Amazon S3, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud directly[1].

## Additional Features

- Centralized management, monitoring, and reporting[1].
- Support for various operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and macOS[1].
- Backup capabilities for virtual machines (VMware, Hyper-V)[1].
- Options for both file-based and image-based backups[5].

While MSP360 requires some configuration, especially in choosing a storage provider, it offers a flexible and powerful solution for backing up Fedora workstations. The ability to choose your own storage provider allows for customization based on your specific needs and budget.

For a fully managed service with less configuration required, you might also consider solutions like HYCU or Acronis, though their specific support for Fedora would need to be verified[6].

Remember to evaluate any backup solution thoroughly to ensure it meets your specific requirements for Fedora desktop protection, including the ability to backup system configurations, installed packages, and important program settings.
