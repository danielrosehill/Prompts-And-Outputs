# Prompt

Good analysis. I'm impressed! Two questions:

1) Any "web to desktop" tools that support Linux, besides this one, and besides the various workspace OS tools like Rambox (etc)

2) Are there any tools like this that have achieved a more seamless integration between web apps and desktop apps? I think that's the obivous way for these tools to go?

And finally ... do any of them support creating the grid views that I really like? I notice that Web Catalog goes for the traditional sidebar switcher UI

# Output

Thank you for your follow-up questions. Let me address them one by one:

1) Linux-compatible "web to desktop" tools:

Besides WebCatalog, there are indeed other tools that support Linux for converting web apps to desktop applications:

- Nativefier: This open-source command-line tool can create desktop applications for websites using Electron, and it supports Linux, macOS, and Windows[3].
- Webapp Manager: This is a Linux-specific tool that allows you to run websites as apps using any browser. It's particularly popular among Linux Mint users but can be installed on other Ubuntu-based distributions[1].

2) Seamless integration between web apps and desktop apps:

While many tools are working towards better integration, most still have limitations. However, some options are moving in this direction:

- ToDesktop: This tool aims to transform web apps into desktop apps with native functionality, potentially offering a more seamless experience[2].
- Firework: While not Linux-specific, it focuses on converting web apps into desktop apps that can be pinned to the taskbar or dock and switched between like regular desktop apps[6].

As for grid views and UI customization:

Currently, most of these tools focus on wrapping websites rather than providing extensive UI customization options. The grid view you're looking for isn't a common feature in web-to-desktop converters. However, some alternatives to consider are:

- SmartSuite's Grid View: While not a web-to-desktop converter, it offers a powerful grid view for project management and data organization[5].
- Custom solutions: Some developers create their own wrappers or use frameworks like Electron to build more customized desktop experiences for web apps, which could include grid views.

It's worth noting that the field of web-to-desktop conversion is evolving, and new tools or features may emerge to address these needs. As of now, achieving a truly seamless integration between web and desktop apps, along with extensive UI customization like grid views, often requires more custom development approaches rather than off-the-shelf solutions.
