# Prompt

Can you describe what devices can be installed or integrated into a desktop computer designed to detect and prevent physical device access (opening the case etc)?

# Output

To secure your desktop computer against unauthorized physical access, including opening the case or tampering with internal components, there are several hardware devices and systems you can install or integrate. These devices typically focus on intrusion detection and physical security measures to alert you or prevent tampering. Here's an overview of some common options:

### 1. **Chassis Intrusion Detection Switch**
   - **Function**: A chassis intrusion detection switch is a small sensor installed inside the case that detects when the case has been opened or tampered with.
   - **How it works**: When the case is opened, the switch is triggered, sending a signal to the BIOS/UEFI, which can then log the event or trigger an alert at the next boot. Some systems can also immediately notify users if connected to an external monitoring solution.
   - **Integration**: Many modern motherboards, including your MSI Pro B760M-A WiFi, have headers for chassis intrusion detection switches.
   - **Cost**: Chassis intrusion switches are usually inexpensive, costing between **$5 and $15**.

### 2. **Kensington Lock (Security Slot)**
   - **Function**: This is a physical lock that attaches to a metal loop or slot in the chassis, making it difficult for someone to move or steal the computer.
   - **How it works**: A cable lock attaches to the desktop and is anchored to a stationary object (e.g., a desk). This prevents someone from physically removing the computer.
   - **Integration**: Some desktop cases come with Kensington lock slots. If your case lacks one, you can install a **Kensington Slot Adapter**.
   - **Cost**: Kensington locks and adapters range from **$20 to $50**.

### 3. **Tamper-Evident Seals or Stickers**
   - **Function**: These are stickers or seals that are placed over screws or case seams, leaving visible evidence if someone tries to open the case.
   - **How it works**: If the case is opened, the tamper-evident seals will tear or change color, making it obvious that the case has been tampered with.
   - **Cost**: Tamper-evident seals are typically very affordable, costing **$5 to $10** for a set.

### 4. **Physical Locking Mechanisms for the Case**
   - **Function**: Some computer cases have integrated locking mechanisms, such as a keyed lock, that prevent the side panel from being opened.
   - **How it works**: The side panel or access points to the motherboard and internal components are secured by a keyed lock, making it difficult to open the case without the correct key.
   - **Integration**: Many high-end or enterprise-grade computer cases come with these locks, or you can retrofit one if your case supports it.
   - **Cost**: Case locks range from **$10 to $30** depending on the system.

### 5. **Intrusion Detection with Alarm Systems**
   - **Function**: A more advanced security system integrates physical access sensors with audible alarms or sends alerts when unauthorized access is detected.
   - **How it works**: Sensors detect when the case is opened or moved, triggering an alarm or sending an alert through a networked system. Some systems can send notifications via email or SMS if integrated with monitoring software.
   - **Cost**: Depending on the sophistication, intrusion detection systems with alarms can range from **$50 to $200**.

### 6. **Remote Monitoring and Anti-Tampering Systems**
   - **Function**: Advanced security systems can monitor your desktop remotely and alert you if there is physical tampering, such as case opening, power interruptions, or changes in system state.
   - **How it works**: These systems integrate with BIOS/UEFI features like Intel AMT (Active Management Technology) or other remote management tools to monitor physical access in real-time.
   - **Integration**: For example, Intel AMT allows system administrators to remotely monitor and manage security events, including chassis intrusion detection.
   - **Cost**: This option is typically found in enterprise environments and is more expensive, costing **$100+**, often as part of a broader system management package.

### 7. **Motion Sensors Inside the Case**
   - **Function**: Motion sensors can be installed inside the case to detect any movement or tampering.
   - **How it works**: If someone tries to open or shake the case, the motion sensor is triggered, which can activate an alarm or send an alert.
   - **Cost**: Motion sensors for case security are generally priced between **$30 and $100**, depending on the system and integration.

### 8. **Smart Locks or Keypad Locks**
   - **Function**: Similar to locking mechanisms for buildings, some companies offer smart locks or keypad locks for computer cases, requiring a PIN or smart key for access.
   - **How it works**: Access to the internal components of the desktop is controlled through a combination of a keypad or digital locking mechanism, adding an extra layer of physical security.
   - **Cost**: Depending on complexity, smart or keypad locks cost between **$100 and $200**.

### 9. **RFID or NFC-based Case Locks**
   - **Function**: Locks that can only be opened with an authorized RFID or NFC card.
   - **How it works**: The user must have a specific RFID or NFC card to unlock the case. If the card is not present, the system remains locked, preventing physical access.
   - **Cost**: RFID or NFC case lock systems usually range from **$50 to $150**.

### 10. **Bios Password and Secure Boot**
   - **Function**: This prevents unauthorized changes to system settings or boot configurations.
   - **How it works**: BIOS passwords, combined with secure boot, ensure that even if someone physically accesses your machine, they cannot alter boot or BIOS settings without the correct password.
   - **Cost**: No additional cost for this option as it’s a feature built into the motherboard's firmware.

### Summary of Costs:
- **Chassis intrusion detection switch**: $5–$15
- **Kensington lock**: $20–$50
- **Tamper-evident seals**: $5–$10
- **Case locks**: $10–$30
- **Intrusion detection systems**: $50–$200
- **Remote monitoring (AMT, etc.)**: $100+
- **Motion sensors**: $30–$100
- **Smart or keypad locks**: $100–$200
- **RFID or NFC locks**: $50–$150
