# Prompt

Is there any data about gross desktop vs laptop sales? Say in the US as a test geography. I presume laptop sales outnumber desktops, but by how much?

# Output

Based on the latest available data for the **U.S. PC market** in 2024, laptop sales significantly outnumber desktop sales:

- In **Q2 2024**, shipments of **notebooks** (including mobile workstations) in the U.S. totaled **50 million units**, showing a growth rate of **4%** year-over-year. In contrast, **desktop** shipments, including desktop workstations, totaled only **12.8 million units**, growing by a modest **1%** compared to the previous year. This means that **laptops outsell desktops by nearly 4:1** in the U.S. market during this period, which is consistent with the general trend of consumers prioritizing **portability and convenience** over the stationary nature of desktops.

- For the **full year of 2024**, the forecast for the **U.S. PC market** (including desktops and laptops) projects a total of **69 million units**. The overall PC market growth of **5%** is largely driven by laptop sales, while desktop sales remain relatively flat. This trend is expected to continue, with laptops being the more popular choice for most consumer and commercial applications, driven by factors such as portability, hybrid work environments, and the adoption of **AI-capable features** that are now starting to make their way into premium laptops.

These figures show that while desktops are not disappearing entirely, they are certainly being overshadowed by **laptops** in terms of unit sales, with a strong preference for **mobile computing** among both consumers and businesses in the U.S. market.

If you're curious about the details, the market preference is primarily driven by the **flexibility** laptops provide, allowing for remote work, study, and portabilityâ€”features that have grown more crucial post-pandemic. Desktops are still preferred in niches where performance and **upgradeability** are crucial, such as **gaming** and **content creation**, but their market share is significantly smaller compared to laptops. 

The data suggests that desktops maintain a steady role but are far from the dominant form factor they once were, with the overall preference clearly shifting towards laptops and even tablets, especially for general consumer use.

Sure! Here's a **matrix** that summarizes the U.S. shipment data from **Q2 2024** for **laptops, desktops, and tablets**, with the **ratios** of tablets and desktops compared to laptops.
