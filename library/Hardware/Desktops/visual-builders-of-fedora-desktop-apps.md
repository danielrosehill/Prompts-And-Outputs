# Prompt

Let's focus on visual development. Can you give me a list of the various visual development tools that are out there for building Linux desktop apps which can run on Fedora. They don't only have to be Python. I'd like whatever is the easiest to use

# Output

Certainly! Here's a list of visual development tools for building Linux desktop applications that can run on Fedora, focusing on ease of use:

1. Glade:
- Designed for GTK+ applications
- User-friendly interface
- Works well with Python (PyGObject) and other languages
- Generates XML files that can be loaded into your application[1]

2. Qt Designer:
- Part of the Qt framework
- Visual design tool for creating Qt-based GUIs
- Works with PyQt and PySide for Python development
- Drag-and-drop interface for easy layout creation[2]

3. Kivy Designer:
- Visual tool for the Kivy framework
- Allows for rapid prototyping of Kivy applications
- Supports Python development
- Good for creating multi-touch applications[3]

4. Lazarus:
- Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for FreePascal
- Includes a visual form designer
- Cross-platform development, including Linux
- Similar to Delphi in its approach to visual development

5. Gambas:
- Visual development environment inspired by Visual Basic
- Designed specifically for Linux
- Includes a form designer and IDE
- Uses its own BASIC-like language

6. Gnome Builder:
- IDE for GNOME development
- Includes UI designer for GTK+ applications
- Supports various languages, including Python
- Integrated with GNOME desktop environment

7. Anjuta DevStudio:
- IDE with visual design capabilities
- Supports GTK+ application development
- Includes a Glade interface designer
- Works well for C, C++, and Python projects

8. wxFormBuilder:
- Visual designer for wxWidgets applications
- Can generate code for various languages, including Python (wxPython)
- Cross-platform tool

9. Electron:
- While not strictly a visual development tool, it allows you to build desktop apps using web technologies
- You can use visual web design tools and then package the app for Linux

10. NetBeans:
- IDE with GUI builder capabilities
- Supports Java desktop application development
- Can be used for creating cross-platform applications

These tools offer various levels of visual development capabilities, from simple drag-and-drop interfaces to more complex IDE environments. For beginners, Glade (for GTK+ applications) or Qt Designer (for Qt applications) might be the easiest to start with, especially if you're planning to use Python. They offer straightforward interfaces for designing GUIs without requiring extensive coding knowledge[1][2].
