# Prompt

Can you give me some examples of specialist hardware that is more commonly used in workstation computers rather than conventional "desktops"?

# Output

Workstations often incorporate specialized hardware components that set them apart from conventional desktop computers. Here are some examples:

1. ECC RAM (Error-Correcting Code Memory): This type of memory can detect and correct common types of data corruption, improving system stability and reliability[4].

2. Xeon or Threadripper Processors: Workstations frequently use Intel Xeon or AMD Threadripper CPUs, which offer higher core counts, larger cache sizes, and support for more memory channels compared to consumer-grade processors[1][4].

3. NVIDIA Quadro or AMD Radeon Pro GPUs: These professional-grade graphics cards are optimized for CAD, 3D rendering, and other specialized applications. They often have more precise floating-point calculations and are certified for professional software[1][4].

4. Multiple CPU Sockets: High-end workstations may support dual or even quad CPU configurations for extreme multi-threading capabilities[1].

5. Larger RAM Capacities: Workstations often support much higher RAM capacities, sometimes up to 1TB or more, compared to typical desktops[4].

6. NVMe SSDs in RAID Configurations: For faster data access and improved reliability, workstations may use multiple NVMe SSDs in RAID setups[4].

7. Specialized I/O Cards: These might include high-speed networking cards, video capture cards, or other industry-specific add-in cards[4].

8. Redundant Power Supplies: For mission-critical applications, some workstations offer redundant power supply options to ensure continuous operation[4].

9. Hardware RAID Controllers: These provide better performance and more advanced RAID options compared to software RAID solutions found in consumer desktops.

10. ISV Certifications: While not hardware per se, workstation components are often certified by Independent Software Vendors (ISVs) for compatibility with specific professional applications[5].

These specialized components contribute to the higher performance, reliability, and precision required for professional workloads in fields like engineering, scientific computing, video editing, and 3D animation.
