Here are some effective ways to set up desktop notifications for work emails on Fedora Linux using Google Workspace:

### 1. **Using a Desktop Email Client**
You can use email clients that support Google Workspace and provide notification features:

- **Thunderbird**: This popular email client allows you to add your Google Workspace account and enables notifications for new emails.
  - To set up: Install Thunderbird, add your Google account using OAuth2, and configure notifications in the settings.
  - **Installation**: You can install Thunderbird from the terminal:
    ```bash
    sudo dnf install thunderbird
    ```
  - More information can be found on [Mozilla's Thunderbird site](https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/).

- **Evolution**: This is another powerful email client that integrates well with GNOME and supports Google accounts.
  - Similar to Thunderbird, you can set up notifications for incoming emails.
  - **Installation**:
    ```bash
    sudo dnf install evolution
    ```
  - For more details, visit [GNOME Evolution](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Evolution).

### 2. **Browser Notifications**
If you prefer using webmail, you can enable notifications directly from your web browser:

- **Google Chrome or Chromium**: 
  - Log in to your Google Workspace email and ensure notifications are enabled in the browser settings.
  - In Gmail, go to Settings > See all settings > General > Desktop Notifications, and select “New mail notifications on”.
  
- **Firefox**: 
  - Similar steps apply. Go to Gmail, click on the gear icon, select Settings > General, and enable desktop notifications.

For detailed instructions, refer to Google’s official support page on [Gmail notifications](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/107901?hl=en).

### 3. **Using `notify-send` Command**
For advanced users, you can create a custom script that checks your email and uses `notify-send` to display notifications:

- You can set up a cron job that runs a script periodically to check for new emails using `curl` with the Gmail API or a command-line tool like `mutt`.
  
- A simple example using `notify-send`:
  ```bash
  #!/bin/bash
  EMAIL=$(curl -s --user 'username:password' "https://mail.google.com/mail/feed/atom")
  if [[ $EMAIL ]]; then
      notify-send "New Email!" "$EMAIL"
  fi
  ```

### 4. **Using Third-Party Applications**
There are dedicated applications designed to provide email notifications:

- **Mailnag**: This is a notification application for emails that can work with various services, including Gmail. It can check for new mail and display notifications.
  - **Installation**:
    ```bash
    sudo dnf install mailnag
    ```
  - For setup details, refer to the [Mailnag documentation](https://github.com/zeniko/mailnag).

- **Mailspring**: A modern email client that supports notifications for multiple accounts, including Google Workspace.
  - **Installation**: Available as a Flatpak, which you can install via:
    ```bash
    flatpak install flathub com.getmailspring.Mailspring
    ```
  - Visit the [Mailspring site](https://getmailspring.com/) for more information.
