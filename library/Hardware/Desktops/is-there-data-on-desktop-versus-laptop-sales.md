# Prompt

Is there any data available on global sales of desktops? Especially how those stand up in comparison to laptop sales and other types of popular computer hardware? I'm always intrigued to know whether the idea that the desktop is going away has any basis. Or if not what the actual trends look like

# Output

Global sales trends for desktops, laptops, and other personal computing devices provide an interesting insight into whether desktops are really becoming obsolete.

### **Current Trends (2024)**
- **Desktops**: In Q1 of 2024, desktop shipments were relatively flat, with a small decrease of **0.4%**, amounting to **12.1 million units** shipped. This indicates that desktops are not seeing major growth but remain a stable part of the market. The trend shows that desktops continue to have a place, but they are certainly not the leading category for growth【52】.
- **Laptops**: Notebooks and mobile workstations saw an increase of **4.2%** in Q1 2024, reaching **45.1 million units**. The overall growth of **3.2%** in the total PC market was largely driven by laptops, which continue to be more popular due to their portability【52】.
- **Tablets**: Tablets experienced significant growth, with shipments increasing by **19.8%** year-over-year in Q2 2024, amounting to **33.8 million units**. This is partly due to new product refreshes and higher demand in emerging markets【53】.

### **Long-Term Market Outlook**
- **Market Segmentation**: For the full year 2024, the traditional PC market (which includes both desktops and laptops) is expected to remain relatively flat at **261 million units**, while the tablet market is projected to grow by **7.2%**. The trend suggests that while PCs, including desktops, still maintain strong market share, the most significant growth is happening in the portable segment, i.e., laptops and tablets【53】.
- **AI Integration**: The introduction of **AI-capable PCs** in 2024 and beyond is set to boost sales slightly, especially as Windows 11 upgrades and AI technologies become more attractive. This trend is likely to give desktops and laptops a renewed purpose, especially for business use, but growth will primarily be driven by laptops【52】.

### **Desktops vs. Laptops: Are Desktops Going Away?**
- While it's clear that **laptops** have continued to outpace **desktops** in terms of sales growth, desktops are **not entirely disappearing**. Instead, they occupy a stable niche, often favored for situations where **performance**, **upgradeability**, and **cost-efficiency** are important—such as in gaming, content creation, and professional workstations.
- The **modest decline** of desktop shipments highlights that while they are not experiencing rapid growth, there is still a consistent demand for them. They continue to serve specific needs better than laptops do, like for users who require a fixed workstation with high performance and better thermal handling.

### **Conclusion**
The idea that desktops are "going away" is not entirely accurate. Although they aren't experiencing the rapid growth seen by laptops or tablets, they maintain a **steady presence** in the market. Laptops and tablets are more in demand because of their **mobility** and the flexibility they provide, which are key factors driving the overall computing market today. However, desktops still hold a place for users requiring **customizability** and **powerful hardware**.

If you're intrigued by future trends, desktops may evolve into more specialized roles rather than mainstream consumer devices, with growth in sectors like gaming, content production, and **AI-capable workstations** potentially keeping them relevant for years to come.
