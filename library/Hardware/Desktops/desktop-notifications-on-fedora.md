# Prompt

any notification agents that can be configured for fedora? I would like to get notified when someone responds to me on reddit!

# Output

There are several notification agents you can configure on Fedora to receive notifications for responses on Reddit. Here are a few options:

### 1. **Notify-OSD**
Notify-OSD is a lightweight notification system that integrates well with various desktop environments, including GNOME and KDE Plasma. You can use it to display notifications for different applications.

### 2. **Dunst**
Dunst is a highly customizable notification daemon that can be used to manage notifications. You can configure it to display notifications for specific events, such as replies on Reddit.

- **Installation**:
  ```bash
  sudo dnf install dunst
  ```

- **Configuration**: You can edit the `~/.config/dunst/dunstrc` file to customize the appearance and behavior of notifications.

### 3. **Signal Desktop**
If you use the Signal messaging app, you can set up notifications for replies from Reddit via direct messages or group chats. Signal has a desktop client that integrates notifications well with your system.

### 4. **Pushbullet or IFTTT**
You can set up services like **Pushbullet** or **IFTTT** to send notifications to your desktop whenever someone replies to your Reddit posts or comments.

- **Using IFTTT**: Create an IFTTT applet that triggers a notification when you receive a reply on Reddit. You can then use the IFTTT app to push notifications to your device.

### 5. **RSS Feeds with a Feed Reader**
Reddit allows you to subscribe to RSS feeds for your comments or posts. You can use an RSS feed reader that supports notifications.

- **Liferea**: A popular RSS feed reader for Linux that can notify you of new updates.

  - **Installation**:
    ```bash
    sudo dnf install liferea
    ```

  - **Setup**: Add your Reddit RSS feed (e.g., your user comments) to Liferea, and configure it to notify you of new updates.

### 6. **Custom Scripts with Cron or Systemd Timers**
If you're comfortable with scripting, you can create a Python or shell script that checks for Reddit replies using the Reddit API and sends notifications using `notify-send` or another notification tool. You can then run this script at regular intervals using a cron job or a systemd timer.

#### Example of a Simple Script:
Here's a basic example using Python:

```python
import requests
import os
from time import sleep

def check_reddit():
    # Replace 'your_username' with your Reddit username
    url = "https://www.reddit.com/user/your_username/comments/.json"
    headers = {'User-Agent': 'Notification Agent'}
    
    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
    comments = response.json()
    
    for comment in comments['data']['children']:
        # Check for replies here
        # You would typically keep track of the last seen comment or similar logic
        print(comment['data']['body'])  # For debugging purposes

if __name__ == "__main__":
    while True:
        check_reddit()
        sleep(60)  # Check every minute
```

You can run this script in the background and use `notify-send` to create desktop notifications when there are new replies.

### Conclusion
Choose the method that fits your needs best, whether it's a standalone notification agent like Dunst, using IFTTT for external notifications, or implementing a custom script to directly monitor Reddit. Let me know if you need help setting up any specific option!
