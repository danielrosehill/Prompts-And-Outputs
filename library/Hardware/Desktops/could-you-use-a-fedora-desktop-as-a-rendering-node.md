Yes, it is possible to use a **Fedora Linux desktop** as a **V-Ray rendering node**. V-Ray supports rendering on **Linux-based systems**, and Fedora is a Linux distribution that can be configured as part of a **V-Ray render farm** or used for **distributed rendering**.

### Steps to Set Up a Fedora Desktop as a V-Ray Rendering Node:

1. **Install V-Ray Standalone**:
   - You need to install the **V-Ray Standalone** application on your Fedora Linux system. V-Ray Standalone is a command-line renderer that supports rendering V-Ray scenes without needing a full 3D modeling application.
   - Download the **Linux version** of V-Ray Standalone from the **Chaos Group** website, which supports Linux distributions like Fedora.

2. **Ensure Compatibility**:
   - V-Ray for Linux is typically distributed as an **RPM package** or can be installed via a **tar.gz** archive, both of which are supported on Fedora.

3. **Licensing**:
   - Ensure that your **V-Ray license** supports the number of render nodes you want to run. You will need to have the appropriate **V-Ray Render Node licenses** to use your Fedora machine for distributed or network rendering.

4. **Configure Network Rendering**:
   - V-Ray supports **distributed rendering** where multiple nodes (including Linux-based ones) can work together to render different parts of a scene.
   - You will need to configure the **V-Ray Spawner** service on your Fedora machine to communicate with the main machine (the one initiating the render). V-Ray Spawner is responsible for managing the rendering tasks assigned to the node.

5. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Fedora may require additional dependencies for V-Ray to function correctly. Make sure to install packages such as **gcc**, **glibc**, **OpenGL**, and others that may be required for V-Rayâ€™s rendering engine.

6. **Start the V-Ray Rendering Node**:
   - Once the installation is complete, start the **V-Ray Standalone** service on your Fedora machine.
   - You can run V-Ray in **command-line mode** to test if it is rendering correctly. Use the terminal to render V-Ray scenes using the following command:
     ```bash
     vray -sceneFile /path/to/scene.vrscene
     ```

7. **Integrate with Other Nodes**:
   - If you are using **distributed rendering**, ensure that your Fedora desktop can communicate with other machines in the render farm, including those running **Windows** or **macOS**. Configure your network settings accordingly.

### Advantages of Using Fedora Linux:
- **Performance**: Linux systems are often considered more lightweight and efficient, which can be beneficial for high-performance tasks like rendering.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Using Linux allows you to avoid additional Windows licensing fees.
- **Flexibility**: Fedora provides access to the latest libraries and tools, which can be helpful for integrating with complex workflows.

### Summary:
Yes, a Fedora Linux desktop can be set up as a V-Ray rendering node by installing **V-Ray Standalone** for Linux. Ensure the appropriate licenses are in place, configure the system for distributed rendering, and make sure dependencies and network settings are correctly configured for optimal performance.
