# Prompt

Is it possible to design a desktop computer with redundant components? For example a standby PSU that could be used in the event that the main PSU fails?

# Output

Yes, it's possible to design a desktop computer with **redundant components** for increased reliability, similar to high-end server setups. Here are some examples:

1. **Redundant Power Supply Units (PSUs)**: Redundant PSUs are common in servers and can be implemented in desktops. These systems use two or more PSUs where one operates as the primary, and the others act as backups. If the primary fails, the standby PSU takes over.

2. **RAID Storage**: Redundant storage setups like **RAID** can protect against disk failure by replicating data across multiple drives.

3. **Redundant Cooling Fans**: Multiple fans ensure cooling even if one fails.

These systems add complexity and cost but can improve uptime and reliability.
