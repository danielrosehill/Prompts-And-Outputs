 can you provide me with a list of GPUs that are capable of running 6 to 9 1920 x 1080 displays and which are capable of working with Fedora Linux. For each please provide an approximate RRP. Focus on the leading options in this product class

Based on the search results and my knowledge of GPUs capable of running multiple displays, here's a list of GPUs that can support 6-9 1920x1080 displays and are likely to work well with Fedora Linux:

1. AMD Radeon RX 580 8GB
   - Supports up to 6 displays
   - Good Linux driver support
   - Approximate RRP: $200-$250

2. AMD Radeon Pro WX 5100
   - Supports up to 6 displays
   - Professional-grade card with excellent Linux support
   - Approximate RRP: $300-$400

3. NVIDIA Quadro P2000
   - Supports up to 4 displays natively, can be expanded to 6+ with DisplayPort MST hubs
   - Good Linux support through NVIDIA drivers
   - Approximate RRP: $400-$500

4. AMD Radeon Pro WX 7100
   - Supports up to 6 displays
   - High-end professional card with excellent Linux support
   - Approximate RRP: $500-$600

5. NVIDIA RTX 4000 Ada Generation
   - Supports up to 4 displays natively, can be expanded with DisplayPort MST hubs
   - Latest generation professional card with good Linux support
   - Approximate RRP: $1000-$1200

6. AMD Radeon Pro W6600
   - Supports up to 6 displays
   - Modern professional card with excellent Linux support
   - Approximate RRP: $600-$700

7. NVIDIA RTX A2000
   - Supports up to 4 displays natively, expandable with MST hubs
   - Compact professional card with good Linux support
   - Approximate RRP: $450-$550

8. AMD Radeon RX 6600 XT
   - Supports up to 4 displays, but can be expanded with MST hubs
   - Good gaming performance and Linux support
   - Approximate RRP: $300-$400

It's important to note that while these GPUs can theoretically support 6 or more displays, some may require the use of DisplayPort MST (Multi-Stream Transport) hubs to achieve the maximum number of displays. Additionally, the actual number of displays supported can depend on the specific model and manufacturer implementation.

For Fedora Linux compatibility, AMD GPUs generally offer better out-of-the-box support due to their open-source drivers. NVIDIA GPUs require proprietary drivers but can still work well once properly set up.

Prices are approximate and can vary based on market conditions and availability.
