To summarize: you're asking about the maximum distance that DisplayPort (DP) cables can reliably deliver video signals from the port to the screen.

### Maximum Reliable Distance for DisplayPort Cables:
The maximum distance a DisplayPort cable can reliably deliver video signals depends on the **version of DisplayPort**, the **cable quality**, and the **resolution and refresh rate** you're trying to achieve.

#### General Guidelines for Standard DP Cables:
- **DisplayPort 1.2**:
  - **1080p (Full HD)**: Up to **15 meters (49 feet)** for standard-quality cables.
  - **4K at 60Hz**: Up to **2 meters (6.5 feet)** for passive cables. You may achieve up to **5 meters (16 feet)** with high-quality, active cables.

- **DisplayPort 1.4**:
  - **4K at 60Hz**: Up to **2 meters (6.5 feet)** with passive cables. Up to **5 meters (16 feet)** with active cables.
  - **8K at 60Hz**: Typically limited to **1.8 meters (6 feet)** or less for passive cables.

- **DisplayPort 2.0**:
  - **8K at 60Hz** or **4K at 144Hz**: Limited to shorter distances, around **1.5 meters (5 feet)** for passive cables, although longer distances are possible with **active** cables.

### Types of DisplayPort Cables:
1. **Passive DP Cables**:
   - These are standard cables that carry the signal without amplification.
   - The maximum reliable distance for passive DP cables at high resolutions (like 4K or higher) is typically around **2 meters (6.5 feet)**. Beyond this, signal degradation can occur, especially at higher refresh rates.

2. **Active DP Cables**:
   - Active DisplayPort cables include electronics that boost the signal, allowing for longer cable runs.
   - With an active cable, you can extend the reliable distance for high-resolution video (e.g., 4K at 60Hz or 8K at 60Hz) up to **5 to 15 meters (16 to 49 feet)**, depending on the cable quality and signal requirements.

### Considerations for Long Distances:
- **Resolution and Refresh Rate**: Higher resolutions (4K, 8K) and refresh rates (120Hz, 144Hz) reduce the maximum distance the signal can travel reliably.
- **Cable Quality**: Always opt for **high-quality DisplayPort cables** with proper shielding and certifications to ensure minimal signal loss over longer distances.
- **Signal Extenders**: If you need to extend beyond the reliable range of DisplayPort cables, you can use **DisplayPort signal extenders** or **fiber optic DisplayPort cables**, which can extend the range to over 100 meters (328 feet).

### Conclusion:
For standard DisplayPort cables, the maximum reliable distance is typically around **2 meters (6.5 feet)** for high resolutions (4K at 60Hz). However, with **active cables**, you can extend this distance up to **5 to 15 meters (16 to 49 feet)**. If you need to go beyond these distances, consider using **signal extenders** or **fiber optic cables**.
