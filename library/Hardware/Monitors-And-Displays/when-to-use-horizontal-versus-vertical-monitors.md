Here are some general guidelines on when to use **vertical** vs **horizontal** monitor layouts:

### Vertical Layout:
- **Writing and Coding**: Displays more lines of text or code, reducing the need for scrolling.
- **Reading Articles/PDFs**: Ideal for long-form content.
- **Multitasking**: Stacking apps like ChatGPT and Obsidian makes it easier to switch between them.

### Horizontal Layout:
- **Web Browsing**: Websites are designed for wide screens, so horizontal is more intuitive.
- **Media Consumption**: Video content and images typically look best in horizontal orientation.
- **Spreadsheets**: Horizontal layouts are better for wide data tables or side-by-side comparisons.

In your case, **vertical** could work well for writing and reading in Obsidian and ChatGPT, while **horizontal** is better for internet browsing or visual work.
