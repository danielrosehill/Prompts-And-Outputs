**Summary of your prompt:** You are asking if there is a specific type of monitor whose brightness can be controlled in a granular way from a computer running Fedora Linux.

### Monitors with Granular Brightness Control on Fedora Linux:

1. **Monitors Supporting DDC/CI (Display Data Channel Command Interface):**
   - Many modern monitors support **DDC/CI**, which allows for controlling settings like brightness directly from the computer. This interface is well-supported by Linux and can be controlled using software tools.
   - **Tool Example**: `ddcutil` is a command-line tool that lets you adjust the brightness of DDC/CI-enabled monitors on Fedora Linux.
   - **Monitor Brands**: Dell, LG, BenQ, and Philips are some brands known for supporting DDC/CI.

2. **Monitors with Built-in Software Control:**
   - Some monitor manufacturers, like **BenQ**, offer software that is compatible with Linux to control various settings including brightness. These software solutions often give you more granular control over brightness levels.

3. **USB-C Monitors:**
   - Some USB-C monitors allow brightness control via the USB-C connection, which can be adjusted programmatically using tools like `ddcutil` or similar utilities on Linux.

4. **Monitors with Hardware-Based Brightness Control via Linux:**
   - Specialized monitors such as those used in professional environments (e.g., color-calibration monitors) may offer more **hardware-based granular control** directly via Linux-compatible drivers or software, but they tend to be more expensive.

### Software Solutions:
- **`ddcutil`**: This tool is widely available on Fedora Linux and allows granular control of brightness and other settings on monitors that support DDC/CI.
   - You can install it via:
     ```bash
     sudo dnf install ddcutil
     ```
   - To adjust brightness:
     ```bash
     ddcutil setvcp 10 <brightness_level>
     ```
   - `<brightness_level>` would be a number between 0 and 100 (or any custom range defined by the monitor).

### Recommendations:
Look for **DDC/CI-supported monitors**, which are common in many mid- to high-range monitors. These will give you the best experience for controlling brightness programmatically on Fedora Linux.
