The **AOC 2275W** does **not support MST (Multi-Stream Transport)** for daisy-chaining monitors. This monitor model, while reliable for standard usage, lacks the hardware capability required for MST, which is essential for connecting multiple monitors via a single DisplayPort cable. If you're looking to drive multiple monitors, you would need either a monitor that supports MST or an external **DisplayPort MST hub** to achieve the same functionality【71†source】【74†source】.

For your current setup, if you want to drive 3 x 1080p displays using the two DisplayPort outputs on your GPU, using an MST hub would be the most practical solution.
