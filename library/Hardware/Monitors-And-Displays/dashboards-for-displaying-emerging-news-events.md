# Prompt

Great. Remember that I'm building a monitoring dashboard for keeping abreast of news developments in a crisis zone and that this would need to be a totally free application. With that context in mind, are there any dashboard builders that give users the ability to embed whatever they please - including custom URLs to show live news feeds? As the channels are very local, I would need something quite customisable

# Output

Given your specific requirements for a free, customizable dashboard to monitor news developments in a crisis zone, I'd recommend focusing on open-source or free solutions that offer high levels of customization and the ability to embed external content. Here are a few options that could work well for your needs:

1. Grafana:
   Grafana is a powerful open-source dashboard tool that offers a free self-hosted version. It's highly customizable and allows you to:
   - Create custom panels that can embed external websites or iframes
   - Use plugins to extend functionality
   - Connect to various data sources, including RSS feeds
   - Set up alerts based on specific criteria

   While it has a learning curve, its flexibility makes it suitable for your custom needs.

2. Freeboard:
   Freeboard is an open-source dashboard platform designed for IoT but adaptable for various uses. It offers:
   - A simple, drag-and-drop interface
   - The ability to create custom widgets, including ones that can embed external content
   - Easy integration with web-based APIs
   - A free self-hosted option

   Its simplicity and customization options could work well for your news monitoring needs.

3. Smashing:
   Smashing (formerly Dashing) is an open-source dashboard framework that allows for high levels of customization. It offers:
   - The ability to create custom widgets in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
   - Easy embedding of external content
   - A wide range of pre-built widgets that can be adapted
   - Complete control over the layout and design

   While it requires some coding knowledge, it provides great flexibility for your specific use case.

4. Netdata:
   Although primarily designed for system monitoring, Netdata is a highly customizable, open-source dashboard solution that can be adapted for other purposes. It offers:
   - The ability to create custom charts and visualizations
   - Options to embed external content
   - Real-time updating capabilities
   - A user-friendly interface for non-technical users

For your specific needs, I would particularly recommend Grafana or Freeboard. Both offer the customization you need to embed local news feeds and other relevant information sources. They allow you to create a tailored dashboard that can display live news feeds from custom URLs alongside other relevant data visualizations.

Remember that while these tools are free, you'll need to host them yourself, which may incur some costs depending on your setup. Also, ensure you have the necessary permissions to embed and display the news content you're planning to use.
