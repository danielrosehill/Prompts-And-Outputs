# Prompt

are there any hardware dimmer switches that can be used to control screen brightness and which work with multiple display devices? 

# Output

Yes, there are hardware dimmer switches that can be used to control screen brightness across multiple display devices, although these solutions are more niche. Here are some options:

1. **USB/Hardware DDC Controllers**: Some hardware devices use DDC/CI (Display Data Channel Command Interface), which allows brightness control via USB or physical knobs that interact with your display. These are often used for multiple monitor setups, enabling you to adjust brightness from a central controller. Examples include:
   - **Lunar** (for macOS) which can interface with hardware brightness controllers.
   - **DDCControl**: This Linux tool interacts with your monitorâ€™s brightness control through DDC, though it is software-based. It may work with physical controllers connected to multiple monitors.

2. **Smart Dimmer Devices**: While primarily used for lighting, some home automation dimmer switches (like **Lutron Caseta** or **Philips Hue Dimmer**) can be repurposed to control screen brightness in certain setups if paired with a compatible home automation system.

3. **External Monitor Brightness Knobs**: Certain high-end external monitors have their own hardware dimming knobs that can adjust brightness without software, but these tend to be monitor-specific and may not apply to multiple devices.

These solutions might not work with all devices, so checking for DDC/CI support in your monitors and operating systems (Windows, Linux, or macOS) is essential.
