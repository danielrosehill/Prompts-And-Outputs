# Prompt

My local technology store sells DP to HDMI cables that are just cables. They seem to work just fine. Is there an adapter built into them?

# Output

Yes, many **DP to HDMI cables** have a small **passive adapter** built into the cable, which allows the signal to be converted from DisplayPort to HDMI. These cables typically work fine when connecting a **DisplayPort source** (such as a PC) to an **HDMI display** (like a monitor or TV). The conversion works because DisplayPort can output an HDMI-compatible signal, and the passive adapter within the cable facilitates this.

However, this works only when the DisplayPort output supports **dual-mode DisplayPort (DP++),** which enables such passive conversion.
