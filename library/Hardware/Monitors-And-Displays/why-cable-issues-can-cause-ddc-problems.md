# Prompt

Whats the likelihood that a bad cable could cause DDC not to work?

# Output

A bad or incompatible cable can **definitely cause DDC/CI communication failures**. DDC/CI relies on certain pins within the cable (particularly the **DDC clock and data pins**) to send commands to the monitor. If these pins are damaged, missing, or not fully connected, DDC commands (like adjusting brightness) may not work.

Here are scenarios where the cable could cause issues:
- **Low-quality HDMI/DisplayPort cables** might not support DDC/CI.
- **Long cables or adapters** can weaken the signal.
- **Loose or damaged connectors** may disrupt communication.

Try swapping the cable with a high-quality, known-working one to rule out this issue.
