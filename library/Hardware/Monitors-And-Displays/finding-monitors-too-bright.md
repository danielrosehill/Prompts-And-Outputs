# Prompt

I struggle with finding monitors too bright, even on their lowest setting. Are there any overlays that are specifically intended to reduce brightness and eye strain and which might be helpful? 
# Output

Yes, there are several software solutions, overlays, and techniques designed to reduce screen brightness beyond what your monitor's settings allow and to alleviate eye strain. Here are a few that might be particularly helpful for you:

### 1. **Gammy**
   - **Gammy** is a brightness and gamma adjustment tool designed specifically to reduce brightness dynamically based on screen content. It’s particularly useful for reducing brightness even lower than your monitor allows, without affecting color accuracy too much.
   - **Key features**:
     - Dynamically adjusts brightness based on the average brightness of the screen.
     - Allows for manual brightness and gamma adjustments.
     - Can lower brightness beyond monitor limits.
   - **Installation**: You can install it from source or find it in some third-party repositories.
   - For Fedora, it may be installed via Flatpak or compiled manually.

### 2. **Redshift**
   - **Redshift** adjusts both brightness and color temperature, reducing the amount of blue light in the evening to alleviate eye strain. While its main goal is reducing blue light, it can also adjust the overall brightness.
   - **Features**:
     - Day and night profiles for different brightness levels.
     - Manual control over brightness and color temperature.
     - Can lower brightness further than your monitor's settings.
   - **Installation**:
     ```
     sudo dnf install redshift
     ```
   - You can adjust brightness using command-line options or set up automated brightness transitions for different times of day.

### 3. **KDE Night Color**
   - KDE Plasma includes a built-in tool called **Night Color** (similar to Redshift). While its main function is reducing blue light, it also provides a basic level of screen dimming, particularly useful at night.
   - **Features**:
     - Time-based color and brightness adjustments.
     - Integrated directly into KDE Plasma.
   - You can find it in **System Settings** > **Display and Monitor** > **Night Color**.

### 4. **f.lux**
   - **f.lux** is another popular tool for reducing eye strain by adjusting color temperature, but it also allows for manual brightness control beyond your display's lowest brightness level.
   - **Key features**:
     - Day and night mode profiles.
     - Adjusts brightness based on your current time and location.
   - **Installation**:
     - You can download it from the official website and install it on Linux. It’s generally user-friendly and widely recommended for eye strain.

### 5. **Gnome Extension: Brightness Control**
   - If you’re using Gnome in conjunction with your KDE Plasma setup (sometimes for specific apps), there are Gnome Shell extensions like **Brightness Control** that allow for more fine-tuned control over brightness levels.
   - **Features**:
     - Allows dimming the screen beyond the native limits.
     - Easily accessible via the system tray or as a slider.

### 6. **Physical Screen Overlays/Filters**
   - If software solutions aren't sufficient, you can use **physical screen overlays** or filters that reduce glare and brightness. These filters are placed directly over your monitor and can significantly reduce brightness and eye strain without affecting the resolution.
   - **Options**:
     - Anti-glare filters.
     - Privacy filters (which also reduce brightness).
     - Matte screen protectors for reducing reflection.

### 7. **xrandr Brightness Adjustment (for X11 users)**
   - If you switch to X11, you can use the `xrandr` command to adjust brightness:
     ```
     xrandr --output <display_name> --brightness 0.5
     ```
   - This adjusts brightness to a percentage of the maximum (e.g., 0.5 means 50% brightness). While not available for Wayland, it’s a simple command-line solution for X11 users.

### 8. **Dimmer for External Screens (GUI Utility)**
   - **Dimmer** is a cross-platform tool (Linux, macOS, Windows) that adds a dimming overlay to your screens. It can reduce the effective brightness of your display without modifying system-level settings.
   - **Installation**:
     - Available through **Flatpak** or compiled from source.

### Summary of Recommendations:
- **Gammy** is a great all-around solution that reduces brightness dynamically.
- **Redshift** or **f.lux** are excellent for adjusting brightness and reducing blue light.
- **KDE Night Color** is already integrated with Plasma, providing basic night-time dimming.
- For more extreme brightness reduction, a **physical overlay** may be worth considering.
