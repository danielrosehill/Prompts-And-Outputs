Absolutely! KDE Plasma is **open-source**, which means anyone with the right skills and dedication can contribute to the project. If you think that showing the **current Kelvin value** in **Night Color** is a useful addition (and it sounds like it definitely is), you can propose and potentially implement that feature yourself. Here's a guide on how to do it:

### **1. Understand the KDE Development Environment**
To contribute to KDE Plasma, you'll need to understand their **development tools**, workflow, and processes:

- **KDE Plasma and KWin** are primarily developed in **C++** and use the **Qt** framework.
- **KWin** is the window manager for KDE, and it is responsible for **Night Color**.

You would be contributing to **KWin**, specifically the part that manages the **Night Color** feature.

### **2. Set Up the Development Environment**
You'll need to set up an environment to contribute:

- **Install Development Tools**:
  - Make sure you have the following tools installed on your system: **CMake**, **Qt**, **Git**, and **gcc/g++** (or Clang).
- **Clone the Repository**:
  - KDE uses **GitLab** to manage code contributions. To begin, you can clone the **KWin** repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://invent.kde.org/plasma/kwin.git
    ```
- **Build KDE From Source**:
  - Follow KDE's official documentation on setting up a development environment. You'll be compiling KWin from source, which can be done using **CMake**:
    ```bash
    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake .. && make
    ```
  - This setup allows you to make changes to the code and test them within a local environment before proposing them.

### **3. Make the Change**
To add a feature like **displaying the current Kelvin value** in Night Color:

- **Find the Night Color Code**:
  - You will need to navigate the KWin codebase to find where **Night Color** is handled. Look for files related to **screen temperature management**.
  - These could be in directories labeled **colorcorrection**, **nightcolor**, or **screenmanager**.
- **Add the Feature**:
  - You'll want to add logic to **display the current color temperature value**. Typically, this might involve:
    - Exposing the **current Kelvin value** via an **UI element** in **System Settings**.
    - If there is a variable holding the temperature (e.g., a setting in **QML** or a **C++** class variable), you would create a method or function to **output** that value to the GUI.
- **Modify UI Components**:
  - KDE uses **QML** for building user interfaces. You’ll likely need to add UI elements that show the current Kelvin temperature in the **Night Color settings** dialog.
  - You can find or create a **text box** or **label** to display this information in real-time.

### **4. Test Your Changes**
Once you've implemented the feature, you’ll need to test it:

- **Compile** the new version of KWin and ensure that the new Kelvin value feature works properly.
- Test how it behaves under different **color transitions** throughout the day and when manually adjusting the settings.
- Ensure the change doesn’t introduce **new bugs** or affect **existing functionality**.

### **5. Submit Your Changes**
Once you are happy with your implementation:

1. **Create an Account on KDE Invent**:
   - KDE uses **GitLab** for source control, called **KDE Invent**. Create an account and sign in.
   
2. **Fork the Repository**:
   - You need to **fork** the **KWin** repository to make changes.

3. **Push Your Changes**:
   - Commit your changes and **push** them to your fork.
   - Ensure you follow KDE's **commit message guidelines** (usually it should be clear and descriptive).

4. **Submit a Merge Request (MR)**:
   - Create a **Merge Request** (MR) on KDE Invent to propose your feature. 
   - In your MR description, explain:
     - **Why** you think the change is valuable.
     - A brief **summary** of what you've done.
     - Mention how the feature **enhances usability**, specifically addressing the pain point that users can't see the current color temperature.

### **6. Participate in the Review Process**
- KDE developers will **review** your code. They may request changes, provide suggestions, or discuss alternatives.
- **Be Open to Feedback**: It is important to be **collaborative** and receptive to the feedback provided by KDE maintainers.

### **7. Engage with the KDE Community**
If you’re serious about contributing, it helps to become part of the **KDE community**:

- **KDE Community Channels**:
  - Join the KDE **Matrix** or **IRC channels** where other developers hang out. You can ask for guidance or discuss your ideas.
- **Mailing Lists**:
  - You could also join the KDE **mailing list** and introduce yourself and your idea. Engaging early on helps you get the attention of other contributors, which may smooth the review process when you submit your MR.

### **8. Resources for KDE Contribution**
- **KDE Developer Documentation**: Check out KDE’s official developer site for guidelines and best practices: [KDE Developer Guide](https://community.kde.org/Get_Involved/development).
- **Plasma Development**: For Plasma-specific contributions: [Plasma Development Guide](https://community.kde.org/Plasma).
- **KWin and Compositor Development**: Since **Night Color** is part of KWin, it’s good to become familiar with how KWin and its compositing features work: [KWin Development](https://community.kde.org/KWin).

### **Summary of Steps to Get Involved**:
1. **Set Up the Environment**: Clone **KWin**, build KDE from source.
2. **Edit Night Color**: Add a feature to show the current Kelvin temperature in the **Night Color** settings.
3. **Test Changes**: Verify that the new feature works well across different scenarios.
4. **Submit an MR**: Fork the repo, push your changes, and create a **Merge Request** on **KDE Invent**.
5. **Engage with Community**: Participate in reviews, incorporate feedback, and become an active KDE contributor.

Making a contribution like this can be challenging, but it’s also rewarding and an excellent way to give back to the **open-source community**. Let me know if you’d like help getting started with the technical aspects, or if you'd like some advice on navigating KDE's community!
