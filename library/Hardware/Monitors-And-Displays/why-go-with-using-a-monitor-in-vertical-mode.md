What are the advantages of using a monitor in vertical mode? Mine is 1920x1080 and I've thought that perhaps it would be useful for working on these GPT outputs. My monitor layout is that I have ChatGPT in one screen and Obsidian in the other side to side. So I guess they'd be stacked vertically instead. What do you think about this approach?

# Output

Using a monitor in **vertical mode** has several advantages, especially for productivity:

1. **Reading and Writing**: Vertical screens are great for viewing long documents, reading articles, coding, or writing, as they display more content without needing to scroll as much.
2. **Efficient Multitasking**: In your case, stacking **ChatGPT and Obsidian** vertically would let you see more content in both apps simultaneously, improving workflow.
3. **More Screen Real Estate**: This setup maximizes the use of space for text-based tasks, especially on a 1920x1080 monitor, where vertical space is often limited in horizontal mode.

Stacking vertically could improve your workflow by reducing the need for constant switching between windows, giving you a better view of both apps.
