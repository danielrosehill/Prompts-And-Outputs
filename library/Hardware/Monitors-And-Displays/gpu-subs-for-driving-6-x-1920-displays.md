# Prompt

Can you recommend some GPUs that would be compatible with my system and which would allow me to drive 6 x 1920x1080 displays? Please provide an RRP for each 

# Output

Based on the specifications of your system, you are currently using an **AMD Radeon RX 7700 XT Pulse Gaming 12GB Sapphire GPU** and have an **850W PSU**, which offers sufficient power for multiple displays. For driving **6 x 1920x1080 displays**, you would likely need a GPU that supports multiple display outputs, and possibly a DisplayPort MST hub or similar setup for connecting that many monitors.

Here are a few GPUs that can handle six displays, along with their approximate RRPs:

1. **AMD Radeon Pro W6800**  
   - Supports up to 6 displays with native DisplayPort 1.4 outputs.  
   - RRP: $2,249.

2. **NVIDIA Quadro RTX 4000**  
   - Supports 4 displays natively but can be expanded to 6 with DisplayPort MST.  
   - RRP: $899.

3. **AMD Radeon RX 6800**  
   - Capable of supporting up to 6 displays using a combination of HDMI and DisplayPort.  
   - RRP: $579.

4. **NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080**  
   - Supports up to 4 displays natively but can also drive 6 displays with additional adapters.  
   - RRP: $699.

5. **AMD Radeon Pro WX 7100**  
   - Can support up to 6 displays via native DisplayPort connections.  
   - RRP: $799.

You could also use MST (Multi-Stream Transport) hubs for any GPU that doesn't natively support 6 outputs.
