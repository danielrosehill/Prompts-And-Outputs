# Prompt

Is it possible to use an AR headset with a desktop computer - especially one running Fedora Linux? By which I mean - using an AR headset as a complete replacement for conventional monitors and using it as a primary interface for using the computer and doing business tasks? Are there people doing this already?

# Output


Based on the search results and current technology trends, using an AR headset as a complete replacement for conventional monitors with a desktop computer running Fedora Linux is technically possible, but still in very early stages and not yet practical for most users. Here are some key points:

1. Limited Linux Support: Most AR headsets have limited or no official Linux support. The search results mention that even VR support on Linux is challenging, with only a few headsets like the Valve Index working reasonably well.

2. Experimental Projects: There are some experimental projects aiming to bring VR/AR support to Linux, but they are not yet mature or widely adopted. For example, the ALVR project mentioned in the search results is trying to enable Quest 2 support on Linux, but it's still in an alpha state.

3. Desktop Replacement Concept: The idea of using AR as a complete desktop replacement is still largely conceptual. While some AR headsets can project virtual screens, they are not yet optimized for long-term use as primary computer interfaces.

4. Fedora-Specific Challenges: The search results don't mention any AR headsets with specific Fedora Linux support. Most Linux VR/AR development seems to be focused on more general Linux support or other distributions.

5. Ongoing Development: There is ongoing work to improve VR/AR support on Linux, as mentioned in the interview with Jan Schmidt. However, this work is still in progress and not yet integrated into mainstream distributions like Fedora.

6. Hardware Limitations: Current AR headsets are not designed for all-day use as monitor replacements. Issues with comfort, battery life, and visual quality over extended periods are still significant hurdles.

While there might be some enthusiasts experimenting with using AR headsets as monitor replacements, it's not a common or well-supported use case yet, especially on Fedora Linux. The technology is evolving rapidly, but it's still several years away from being a practical replacement for traditional monitors for most business tasks.

For those interested in exploring this concept, it would likely require significant technical expertise, custom software development, and a willingness to work with experimental, potentially unstable setups. It's an exciting area of development, but not yet ready for mainstream adoption or business use.
