# Prompt

Great! Can phoronix provide an estimate for benchmark duration? Is there a shorter version of the full system benchmark that can be ruN?

# Output

Yes, the Phoronix Test Suite can provide estimates for benchmark duration, although the actual time may vary based on your system's performance and configuration. Here's how you can approach running benchmarks efficiently:

### **Estimating Benchmark Duration with Phoronix**
- **Pre-Run Information**: When you initiate a benchmark using the Phoronix Test Suite, it typically displays an estimated duration before running the tests. This estimate gives you an idea of how long each benchmark will take.
- **Configuration**: Some benchmarks allow you to configure parameters that can affect duration. For example, you can specify the number of iterations or the size of the data being processed.

### **Shorter Version of Full System Benchmark**
Phoronix Test Suite includes several predefined test suites, and you can choose to run specific individual benchmarks instead of the entire suite. Here are some options for running shorter benchmarks:

#### **1. Use Specific Tests**
Instead of running the entire benchmark suite, you can choose specific tests that are of interest. For example, you might only want to run the CPU and memory tests:

- **Run Specific Tests**:
  ```bash
  phoronix-test-suite run cpu
  phoronix-test-suite run memory
  ```

#### **2. Use the `--quick` Option**
Phoronix Test Suite has a `--quick` option that allows you to run a faster version of certain benchmarks. This option prioritizes speed over thoroughness:

- **Example Command**:
  ```bash
  phoronix-test-suite benchmark --quick
  ```

#### **3. Custom Test Suites**
You can also create a custom test suite that includes only the benchmarks you want to run, thereby shortening the overall test duration.

### **Summary of Steps to Run Shorter Benchmarks**
1. **Use Specific Commands**: Run individual benchmarks rather than the complete suite.
2. **Use `--quick` Option**: This option allows for quicker runs of the benchmark suite.
3. **Create a Custom Suite**: If you have specific benchmarks you want to focus on, you can define a custom suite.

### **Example of Running a Shorter Benchmark**
Hereâ€™s how you might run specific benchmarks for a quick assessment:

```bash
# Run only CPU Benchmark
phoronix-test-suite run cpu

# Run only Memory Benchmark
phoronix-test-suite run memory

# Run a quick test of the entire suite
phoronix-test-suite benchmark --quick
```

### **Note**
- Keep in mind that while shorter benchmarks are more efficient, they may not provide as comprehensive results as longer tests.
- Always check the Phoronix documentation or use the `--help` flag to see all available options for your benchmarking needs.
