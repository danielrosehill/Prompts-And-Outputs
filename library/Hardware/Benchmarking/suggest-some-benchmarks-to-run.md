# Prompt

You mentioned that it might be interesting to run some benchmarks because of the BTRFS + RAID1 setup. Could you recommend some benchmarks that I can run and publish then? I'm going to be going with the github approach

# Output

Here are some benchmarks that would be particularly interesting for your **BTRFS + RAID1** setup, especially if you're planning to publish the results on GitHub. The focus will be on **disk performance**, **file system features**, and **RAID1 resilience**.

### **1. Disk I/O Performance Benchmarking**
   Measuring raw disk performance (read, write, and latency) will help assess the performance impact of using BTRFS with RAID1.

   #### **Tool: `fio` (Flexible I/O Tester)**
   - **Purpose**: `fio` is a versatile tool to benchmark I/O operations.
   - **Installation**:
     ```bash
     sudo dnf install fio
     ```
   - **Example Commands**:
     - **Sequential Write**:
       ```bash
       fio --name=write_test --size=4G --bs=1M --numjobs=1 --rw=write --direct=1 --sync=1 --group_reporting
       ```
     - **Random Read/Write**:
       ```bash
       fio --name=random_rw_test --size=4G --bs=4K --numjobs=1 --rw=randrw --direct=1 --sync=1 --group_reporting
       ```
   - **Key Metrics**: IOPS, latency, throughput (MB/s).
   - **Publish**: Include results as tables or charts in your GitHub README.md.

### **2. BTRFS-Specific Features Benchmarking**
   BTRFS has many unique features (compression, snapshots, deduplication), and you can benchmark how these features impact performance.

   #### **Tool: `btrfs-balance`, `btrfs-compression` Tests**
   - **Purpose**: Benchmark BTRFS-specific features like compression and deduplication.
   - **Compression Benchmark**:
     - **Test**: Create large files on your BTRFS volume and compare read/write performance with and without compression.
     - **Example**:
       ```bash
       # Without compression
       time dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/btrfs/testfile bs=1M count=4096

       # With compression (using BTRFS mount options)
       mount -o compress=zlib /dev/sdaX /mnt/btrfs
       time dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/btrfs/testfile_compressed bs=1M count=4096
       ```

   - **Snapshot Benchmark**:
     - **Test**: Measure the performance of creating and using snapshots on the BTRFS volume.
     - **Example**:
       ```bash
       btrfs subvolume snapshot /mnt/btrfs/ /mnt/btrfs/snapshot_test
       ```

   - **Key Metrics**: Time taken to create snapshots, time to read/write files with and without compression.
   - **Publish**: Compare the performance impact of BTRFS features in your GitHub project.

### **3. RAID1 Resilience and Recovery Benchmark**
   Since you're using RAID1, it's important to test **RAID1 resilience** by simulating a disk failure and measuring how the system handles it.

   #### **Tool: Manual RAID Degradation & Rebuild**
   - **Purpose**: Measure the performance and resilience of your RAID1 setup during a disk failure.
   - **Test**:
     - Simulate a failure by unmounting or disabling one of the RAID1 drives.
     - Measure system performance while one disk is offline.
     - Rebuild the array and measure how long it takes for the RAID1 to return to full redundancy.
     - **Example**:
       ```bash
       # Remove one disk from RAID1
       sudo btrfs device remove /dev/sdb /mnt/btrfs

       # Re-add the disk and measure time to rebuild
       sudo btrfs device add /dev/sdb /mnt/btrfs
       sudo btrfs balance start /mnt/btrfs
       ```

   - **Key Metrics**: RAID1 rebuild time, system performance during disk failure.
   - **Publish**: Document the rebuild process and time taken, and provide a comparison of performance with and without RAID1 resilience.

### **4. General File System Performance**
   A general file system benchmark to measure how BTRFS performs under various workloads.

   #### **Tool: `bonnie++`**
   - **Purpose**: `bonnie++` is designed to test file system performance.
   - **Installation**:
     ```bash
     sudo dnf install bonnie++
     ```
   - **Example Command**:
     ```bash
     bonnie++ -d /mnt/btrfs/ -s 4G
     ```
   - **Key Metrics**: Sequential I/O, random I/O, file metadata performance.
   - **Publish**: Export the results and include charts in your GitHub project.

### **5. File System Latency Tests**
   Measure the time it takes to access and write small files, which can be crucial for real-world applications like databases.

   #### **Tool: `ioping`**
   - **Purpose**: `ioping` measures disk latency, particularly useful for testing BTRFS with RAID1.
   - **Installation**:
     ```bash
     sudo dnf install ioping
     ```
   - **Example Command**:
     ```bash
     ioping -c 10 /mnt/btrfs/
     ```
   - **Key Metrics**: Latency in milliseconds.
   - **Publish**: Include latency comparisons for different RAID setups and BTRFS features (compression, snapshots).

### **6. File Integrity Check During Heavy I/O**
   Since you're using RAID1, testing the file integrity under heavy I/O load is important.

   #### **Tool: `stress` + `md5sum`/`sha256sum`**
   - **Purpose**: Test system stability and file integrity under heavy load.
   - **Installation**:
     ```bash
     sudo dnf install stress
     ```
   - **Test**:
     - Run a stress test while copying large files and verifying their integrity using `md5sum` or `sha256sum`.
     ```bash
     stress --cpu 4 --io 4 --vm 2 --vm-bytes 128M --timeout 60s
     md5sum largefile
     ```

   - **Key Metrics**: File integrity (hash matches), system stability under heavy load.
   - **Publish**: Document the effect of stress on the file system and RAID1 integrity.

### **Publishing on GitHub**
1. **Create a Repository**:
   - Set up a GitHub repository for your benchmark project.
   - Include the raw output of benchmark results in text files or CSV format.
   
2. **Write Documentation**:
   - Use Markdown files (e.g., README.md) to document the benchmarking process, system specs, RAID1 setup, and BTRFS configuration.
   - Add charts and graphs for visual comparison.

3. **Version Control**:
   - Keep track of different benchmarks, configurations, and changes to the system over time using GitHub's version control features.

By running these benchmarks and documenting the results, you can provide valuable insights into how BTRFS and RAID1 perform under various workloads and conditions. Let me know if you need any assistance with setting up the benchmarks or publishing the results!
