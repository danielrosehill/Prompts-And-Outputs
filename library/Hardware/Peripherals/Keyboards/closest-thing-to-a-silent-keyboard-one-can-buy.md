**Summary of the prompt:**
You asked about the closest thing to a totally silent keyboard that exists.

### Options for Silent Keyboards:

1. **Mechanical Keyboards with Silent Switches:**
   - Mechanical keyboards can be loud, but some models use **silent switches** that significantly reduce noise. These switches are designed to dampen both the actuation and the return of the key.
   - **Examples of Silent Switches**:
     - **Cherry MX Silent Red / Silent Black**: These are versions of the popular Cherry MX switches with built-in dampening to minimize noise. The Silent Red offers a linear feel (no tactile bump) and light actuation, while the Silent Black is heavier.
     - **Gateron Silent Red / Silent Brown**: Similar to Cherry’s options but with a slightly different feel. Gateron switches are known for being smoother, and the silent versions are very quiet.
     - **Razer Yellow / Orange (Silent)**: These switches are used in Razer keyboards and are designed for quieter typing or gaming. The **Razer Yellow** is linear and very quiet, while the **Razer Orange** has a tactile bump but is still dampened.
     - **Topre Silent Switches**: Found on high-end keyboards like the **Topre Realforce Silent**, these switches are known for their quiet operation and unique feel. They combine membrane and mechanical features, making them quieter than standard mechanical keyboards.

2. **Membrane Keyboards:**
   - **Membrane keyboards** are generally quieter than mechanical ones. Since they don’t use individual switches, there’s less noise from key actuation.
   - **Silent Membrane Keyboards**:
     - **Logitech K740**: A full-size membrane keyboard known for its quiet keys. It’s not totally silent but much quieter than most mechanical keyboards.
     - **Microsoft Surface Keyboard**: This keyboard is designed to be slim and quiet. The membrane keys make it very silent for office use.
     - **HP Wireless Elite Keyboard v2**: Another option with quiet membrane keys, suitable for those looking for a softer touch and quieter typing experience.

3. **Scissor-Switch Keyboards:**
   - **Scissor-switch keyboards** (like those on most laptops) are known for being quiet because of the way the mechanism is designed to minimize travel distance and noise.
   - **Examples**:
     - **Apple Magic Keyboard**: One of the quietest keyboards available, with scissor-switch mechanisms. It has a low-profile, laptop-like feel and minimal noise.
     - **Logitech MX Keys**: A scissor-switch keyboard designed for quiet operation, it’s popular for office use and has a solid, quiet typing experience.
     - **Keychron K3**: This low-profile keyboard comes with scissor-switch options and mechanical options. The scissor-switch variant is quieter than typical mechanical keyboards.

4. **Specialized Ultra-Quiet Keyboards:**
   - **Truly Ergonomic CLEAVE Keyboard**: Designed for ergonomics and quiet typing, it features silent mechanical switches with dampening to reduce noise.
   - **Realforce R2 PFU Edition Silent Keyboard**: Uses **Topre Silent switches**, which are quieter than most mechanical options. It’s a high-end keyboard with a unique feel and very quiet operation.
   - **Matias Quiet Pro**: A mechanical keyboard specifically designed for reduced noise. It uses a custom switch called the **Matias Quiet Click**, which is designed to be quieter than Cherry MX Browns while retaining a tactile feel.

### Tips for Reducing Keyboard Noise Further:
1. **O-Ring Dampeners:**
   - If you have a mechanical keyboard, you can add **O-ring dampeners** to each keycap. These small rings cushion the keypress and reduce both actuation and bottom-out noise.
   - Available in different thicknesses, O-rings can be used to customize how quiet your keyboard becomes.

2. **Desk Mat or Keyboard Mat:**
   - Placing a **soft mat** under your keyboard can absorb some of the vibrations and reduce the overall noise level.
   - It also helps prevent the keyboard from sliding around and can make for a more comfortable typing experience.

3. **Lubricating Switches:**
   - Applying **lubricant** to mechanical switches can help reduce friction and noise. This is a more advanced method but can make a noticeable difference in reducing sound.

### Conclusion:
For the **quietest typing experience**, consider:
- **Cherry MX Silent Red or Topre Silent switches** for a mechanical option that retains the feel of mechanical keyboards but with minimal noise.
- **Apple Magic Keyboard or Logitech MX Keys** for scissor-switch, laptop-style keyboards that are inherently quiet.
- **Membrane keyboards like the Logitech K740** for a more traditional silent typing experience without the need for individual switches.

These options should cover a wide range of preferences, from mechanical enthusiasts to those looking for a quieter, office-friendly solution. Let me know if you need more details on any specific option!
