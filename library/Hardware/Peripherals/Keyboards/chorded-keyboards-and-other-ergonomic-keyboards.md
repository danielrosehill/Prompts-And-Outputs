You asked about corded (chorded) keyboards and other methods to make typing easier. Hereâ€™s an overview of chorded keyboards and alternative approaches to simplify typing.

Chorded Keyboards

A chorded keyboard works by pressing combinations of keys at once (similar to playing chords on a piano) to input different characters, words, or commands. Instead of hitting individual keys for each letter, you "chord" several keys simultaneously. This drastically reduces the number of keys required and allows users to input text with fewer finger movements.

Some benefits include:

Minimal key sets: Devices like the Twiddler use fewer keys, often as few as five or six, making it a compact, portable alternative to traditional keyboards.

Less strain: Because you use multiple fingers for single inputs, this can reduce repetitive stress injuries by cutting down on the number of key presses.

Learning curve: While efficient, it requires practice to memorize combinations for each character.


Other Methods Explored to Make Typing Easier:

1. Ergonomic Keyboards:

Split Keyboards: These separate the keyboard into two or more sections, allowing for more natural hand positioning. Examples include the Kinesis Advantage and ErgoDox.

Vertical Keyboards: Designed for users to type with their hands in a handshake position, reducing wrist strain. The Kinesis Freestyle or Microsoft Sculpt are popular options.



2. Predictive Text & Autocompletion:

Predictive text is commonly used in smartphones but is also increasingly incorporated into desktop software (e.g., Grammarly, Google Smart Compose). It suggests words or phrases based on what you've typed so far, reducing the need to type every character manually.

Text expansion tools (like TextExpander) allow users to create shortcuts for common phrases or long words.



3. Swipe Typing:

On touch devices, swipe keyboards (like Gboard or SwiftKey) allow you to swipe your finger across the keyboard, connecting letters to form words, making it faster and easier to type on small screens.



4. Speech-to-Text:

Though you mentioned voice control can be buggy, tools like Dragon NaturallySpeaking or built-in OS tools like Google Dictation on Android and Apple Dictation on macOS have become increasingly reliable and can assist users who prefer to speak instead of typing.



5. One-Handed Keyboards:

Some keyboards are specifically designed for one-handed use. For example, the Dvorak One-Handed Keyboard layout is optimized for one hand, useful for users with disabilities or in situations where only one hand is available.



6. Keyboard Remapping & Custom Layouts:

Many people find alternative keyboard layouts like Dvorak or Colemak easier on their fingers and more efficient than the traditional QWERTY layout. These layouts can reduce finger travel and improve typing speed and comfort.

Software like Karabiner (macOS) or AutoHotkey (Windows) allows users to remap keys to custom configurations that better suit their needs.



7. Wearable Keyboards:

Devices like the Tap Strap let you type by tapping your fingers on any surface, using sensors to detect finger motions and translating them into text. This can provide a portable typing solution without the need for a traditional keyboard.



8. Eye-Tracking and Gaze Typing:

Eye-tracking technology (like Tobii Eye Tracker) enables users to select keys by looking at them. This method is often used in assistive technology for individuals with limited mobility, allowing typing via eye movements.



9. Custom Macro Pads:

For people who frequently use repetitive commands, macro pads (e.g., Stream Deck) allow custom buttons to be mapped to commonly used functions or snippets of text, speeding up typing and reducing hand movement.
