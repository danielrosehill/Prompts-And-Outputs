# Prompt

I don't think I need the most customisable option out there. I just need to be able to configure and periodically change the shortcuts that I assign. 8 keys sounds a bit limited. can you suggest one with a bit more keys? And give me a sense for pricing and where I buy these things as it's quite specialised hardware

## Pricing and Availability

The prices for these specialized keyboards typically range from $150 to $250, depending on the model and features. You can find these products at various retailers:

1. **Online marketplaces**: Amazon, Newegg, and B&H Photo Video often carry a wide range of programmable keyboards.

2. **Manufacturer websites**: Many of these products can be purchased directly from the manufacturer's website (e.g., Elgato, X-keys, Logitech).

3. **Electronics retailers**: Best Buy, Micro Center, and similar stores may carry some of these products in-store or online.

4. **Gaming peripherals stores**: Specialized gaming stores like GameStop or online retailers focusing on gaming peripherals may offer these keyboards.

When purchasing, consider factors like warranty, return policy, and customer support, especially since these are specialized devices. It's also worth checking for any available discounts or bundle deals, as these keyboards are sometimes packaged with other peripherals or software.

Remember that while these keyboards offer more keys and flexibility than an 8-key option, they're still designed to complement your main keyboard rather than replace it entirely. This setup allows you to have a dedicated space for your custom shortcuts without interfering with your regular typing experience.
