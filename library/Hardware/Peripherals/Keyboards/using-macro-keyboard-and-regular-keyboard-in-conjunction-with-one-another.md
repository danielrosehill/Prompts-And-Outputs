Yes, it is entirely possible to use both a macro keyboard and your primary mechanical typing keyboard simultaneously. Both devices are recognized independently by the computer, and they can function without conflict. Here are a few details to keep in mind:

- **Dual Bluetooth Setup**: You can use both your mechanical keyboard and a macro keyboard via Bluetooth. Just make sure each device is paired correctly. Modern operating systems can handle multiple Bluetooth peripherals without issues.
- **Wired + Bluetooth Combination**: If you encounter any connectivity or latency issues with Bluetooth, you can always use one device as wired and the other as Bluetooth. This combination works smoothly and might offer better stability.
