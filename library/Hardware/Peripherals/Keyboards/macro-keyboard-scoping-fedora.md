# Prompt

I like the second option the best. Can you give me a few more options like it? Do they have GUIs? How do you configure what the shortcut keys do? And I presume that it's possible to change them once they've been configured. Is it a lot of work to set up?
# Output

Based on your preference for the X-keys XK-24, I'll suggest a few similar options and provide information about their configuration process:

## Similar Options

1. **Max Falcon-32**
   - 32 programmable keys
   - Price range: $70 - $90
   - Open-source firmware

2. **Koolertron Single-Handed Programmable Keyboard**
   - 43 programmable keys
   - Price range: $80 - $100
   - Supports multiple layers

3. **Delux T9 Pro**
   - 46 programmable keys
   - Price range: $60 - $80
   - RGB backlight

## Configuration and GUI

Most of these devices, including the X-keys XK-24, come with their own configuration software that includes a GUI:

1. **X-keys XK-24**: Uses MacroWorks 3 (MW3) software, which has a graphical interface for programming keys[1].

2. **Max Falcon-32**: Uses an open-source firmware and can be programmed through a web-based configurator.

3. **Koolertron**: Comes with its own programming software with a GUI.

4. **Delux T9 Pro**: Uses proprietary software with a visual interface for key mapping.

## Configuring Shortcut Keys

The process is generally straightforward:

1. Install the device's software on your computer.
2. Open the software and connect your device.
3. Click on the key you want to program in the software's GUI.
4. Assign the desired function (keystroke, macro, application launch, etc.) to the key.
5. Save the configuration to the device.

## Changing Configurations

Yes, it's absolutely possible to change the configurations once they've been set:

1. Simply open the configuration software again.
2. Select the key you want to modify.
3. Change its assigned function.
4. Save the new configuration to the device.

## Setup Effort

Setting up these devices is generally not very time-consuming:

1. **Initial setup**: Installing the software and getting familiar with it might take 15-30 minutes.
2. **Programming keys**: Once you're familiar with the software, programming a key usually takes less than a minute.
3. **Complex macros**: Creating more complex macros or scripts might require more time and some trial and error.

For the X-keys XK-24 specifically, the setup process is user-friendly:

1. Install MacroWorks 3 from the provided disc.
2. Plug in the X-keys and let Windows recognize it.
3. Press the programming switch to open the MW3 programming window.
4. Click on a key in the GUI or press it on the device to start programming.
5. Enter the desired keystrokes, text, shortcuts, or functions.
6. Save the configuration[1].

The process is designed to be intuitive, and most users find they can set up basic functions quite quickly. More advanced features might require some experimentation, but the learning curve is generally manageable.
