Based on the keyboards and mice inventory, we can categorize the items by quality, identifying which ones are high quality, midrange, or lower quality that you might consider giving away or discarding.

### Keyboards

#### High Quality (Keep)
- **Logitech K120 keyboard** - Solid, budget-friendly, durable.
- **Logitech K270 - wireless keyboard for media center** - Reliable wireless keyboard for media centers.
- **Logitech Pebble Keys 2 K380s** - Compact, portable, and well-regarded for portability.

#### Midrange (Consider Keeping)
- **Imitation MX blue keyboard** - The quality depends on the build and brand. Generally decent, but an imitation could lack the durability of genuine Cherry MX switches.

#### Lower Quality (Consider Giving Away or Discarding)
- **Hermitshell Travel Case for Logitech K380** - Not a keyboard itself but could be discarded if not needed anymore.

### Mice

#### High Quality (Keep)
- **Logitech MX Vertical** - Well-regarded ergonomic mouse designed to reduce strain.

#### Midrange (Consider Keeping)
- **Logitech M185 wireless mouse** - A dependable budget wireless mouse.
- **Logitech M150** - Solid, affordable option, though older.

#### Lower Quality (Consider Giving Away or Discarding)
- **Desktop wired vertical mouse** - The quality depends on the specific model, though it might not be as well-known as the Logitech MX Vertical.
- **HP mouse (wired)** - Basic, probably an older or lower-tier mouse.
- **Ergonomic / vertical mouse (wired)** - May not be necessary if you have better ergonomic options like the Logitech MX Vertical.
