# Prompt

I'm indeed worried about conflicts. I've often thought that it would be great to have a shortcut keyboard just for creating custom shortcuts. Is that something that can be purchased? If so, could you list some compatible hardware (for fedora)? I think it would be a worthwhile project as I have lots of keys that I would like to set up (although I wonder then how I would use two keyboards at once .... any ideas?)

# Output

The idea of having a dedicated shortcut keyboard for custom shortcuts is indeed a great one, especially for power users who want to maximize their productivity. This concept is often referred to as a "macro keyboard" or "stream deck." Here's some information on this topic:

## Macro Keyboards

Macro keyboards are specialized input devices designed specifically for executing custom shortcuts and commands. They're compatible with Fedora and most other operating systems.

**Popular Options:**

1. **Elgato Stream Deck**: Originally designed for streamers, it's highly customizable and works well for general productivity[3].

2. **Max Falcon-8**: A programmable 8-key keypad that's open-source and highly customizable.

3. **X-keys**: Offers various models with different numbers of programmable keys.

4. **Razer Tartarus**: A gaming keypad that can be repurposed for productivity shortcuts.

## DIY Solutions

For the more technically inclined, there are DIY options:

1. **QMK-compatible keyboards**: Many enthusiast mechanical keyboards support QMK firmware, allowing for extensive customization.

2. **Arduino-based solutions**: You can create your own macro keyboard using an Arduino board and some switches.

## Using Multiple Keyboards

Using two keyboards simultaneously is indeed possible in Fedora:

1. **Plug and Play**: Most modern operating systems, including Fedora, support multiple input devices simultaneously. You can simply plug in both keyboards, and they should work concurrently[2].

2. **Different Layouts**: It's possible to set up different layouts for different keyboards. This can be achieved using tools like `keyd`, which allows you to configure multiple keyboards with different layouts on the same machine[2].

## Setting Up Your Macro Keyboard

1. **Install necessary drivers**: Most macro keyboards will work out of the box, but some might require additional software.

2. **Configure shortcuts**: Use the device's software or Fedora's built-in keyboard shortcut settings to assign actions to each key.

3. **Consider using AutoKey**: This powerful tool allows you to create complex scripts and assign them to keyboard shortcuts.

By using a dedicated macro keyboard alongside your regular keyboard, you can significantly expand your shortcut capabilities without worrying about conflicts with system or application shortcuts. This setup allows you to keep your main keyboard layout clean while having a separate device for all your custom actions and shortcuts.
