# Prompt
Great. As you know I am doing a lot of work capturing prompts and outputs. I'm now using Obsidian. I'm trying to think of some keyboard shortcuts that could speed up my data capture. Down the line I might like to use something like a macro keyboard. But for now let's just assume regular hardware. Can you think of some shortcut keys and key combinations that could be useful for my very specific purpose?

# Output
Certainly! Creating efficient keyboard shortcuts for capturing prompts and outputs in Obsidian can significantly speed up your workflow. Let's design a set of shortcuts tailored to your specific needs for working with AI outputs and prompts. Here are some suggestions:





# Obsidian Keyboard Shortcuts for AI Prompt and Output Capture

## Quick Note Creation
1. Ctrl + Alt + P: Create new prompt note
2. Ctrl + Alt + O: Create new output note
3. Ctrl + Alt + C: Create new combined prompt-output note

## Template Insertion
4. Ctrl + Shift + 1: Insert prompt template
5. Ctrl + Shift + 2: Insert output template
6. Ctrl + Shift + 3: Insert analysis template

## Navigation
7. Alt + Left Arrow: Jump to previous prompt/output
8. Alt + Right Arrow: Jump to next prompt/output
9. Ctrl + Alt + F: Toggle focus mode (hide all panels)

## Tagging and Linking
10. Ctrl + Alt + T: Quick tag insertion menu
11. Ctrl + Alt + L: Quick link to related note

## Formatting
12. Ctrl + Alt + H: Highlight selected text
13. Ctrl + Alt + B: Convert selected text to callout block

## AI-Specific Actions
14. Ctrl + Alt + A: Append current date/time stamp
15. Ctrl + Alt + M: Insert metadata template (e.g., AI model, parameters)

## Utility
16. Ctrl + Alt + S: Save and create a new version of the current note
17. Ctrl + Alt + D: Duplicate current note for iteration

## Custom Panels
18. Ctrl + Alt + 1: Toggle custom "Prompts" panel
19. Ctrl + Alt + 2: Toggle custom "Outputs" panel
20. Ctrl + Alt + 3: Toggle custom "Analysis" panel



These shortcuts are designed to streamline your workflow for capturing and organizing AI prompts and outputs. Here's how you can implement and use them effectively:

1. **Implementation in Obsidian:**
   - Go to Settings > Hotkeys
   - Search for the command you want to assign (e.g., "Create new note")
   - Click the plus icon next to the command and press your desired key combination

2. **Custom Commands:**
   For more complex actions (like inserting templates or custom panels), you might need to use the Obsidian API or community plugins. The "Templater" plugin is particularly useful for inserting pre-defined templates.

3. **Template Usage:**
   Create templates for prompts, outputs, and analysis. Your shortcut keys can then quickly insert these templates into new notes.

4. **Custom Panels:**
   You can create custom views in Obsidian (using plugins like "Dataview") to display all your prompts, outputs, or analyses. The shortcuts can toggle these views.

5. **Tagging System:**
   Develop a consistent tagging system (e.g., #prompt, #output, #analysis) and use the quick tag insertion shortcut to easily categorize your notes.

6. **Version Control:**
   The "Save and create new version" shortcut can help you keep track of iterations of your prompts or analyses.

7. **Metadata:**
   Use the metadata template shortcut to quickly insert relevant information about the AI interaction (model used, parameters, date, etc.)

8. **Focus Mode:**
   This can help you concentrate on the current prompt or output without distractions.

Tips for using these shortcuts effectively:

1. Start with a few essential shortcuts and gradually incorporate more as you become comfortable.
2. Consider creating a cheat sheet note in Obsidian with all your custom shortcuts for easy reference.
3. Regularly review and refine your shortcut system based on your evolving workflow.
4. Use consistent prefixes (like Ctrl + Alt) for related actions to make them easier to remember.

Remember, these shortcuts are suggestions and should be customized to fit your specific workflow and preferences. Obsidian's flexibility allows you to create a system that works best for you.
