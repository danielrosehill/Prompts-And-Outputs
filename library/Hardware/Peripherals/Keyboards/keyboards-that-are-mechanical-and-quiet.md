Yes, there are several mechanical keyboards specifically designed for **quiet typing**, which can be ideal for heavy typists who tend to bottom out keys. These keyboards use **switches** that are either inherently quiet or designed to dampen noise.

### Key Features to Look for:
1. **Switch Types**:
   - **Cherry MX Silent Red or Black**: These are popular options for quieter typing. They are designed with dampeners to reduce the noise made when the keys are pressed and released.
   - **Kailh Box Silent**: Another quiet switch option known for durability and smooth operation.
   - **Gateron Silent Switches**: Gateron also offers silent switches that are smooth and quieter compared to traditional mechanical switches.

2. **O-Rings**:
   - Adding **O-rings** to the keys can help further reduce noise by cushioning the bottom-out action, which is particularly useful for heavy typists who press keys all the way down.

### Recommended Quiet Mechanical Keyboards:
1. **Corsair Strafe RGB MK.2 (Cherry MX Silent Switches)**:
   - **Switch Type**: Cherry MX Silent.
   - **Features**: This keyboard offers quiet typing with Cherry’s Silent switches and RGB lighting. It is designed for gaming but works excellently for quiet office environments.
   - **Noise Reduction**: It’s specifically designed to dampen the sound of typing while maintaining the tactile feel of mechanical keys.

2. **Ducky One 2 SF (Silent Red or Silent Black switches)**:
   - **Switch Type**: Cherry MX Silent Red or Black.
   - **Features**: Compact layout and known for excellent build quality. This keyboard provides quiet keypresses while offering a mechanical feel, ideal for both gaming and typing-heavy tasks.

3. **Das Keyboard 4Q (Cherry MX Silent Red switches)**:
   - **Switch Type**: Cherry MX Silent Red.
   - **Features**: This premium keyboard focuses on quiet typing while offering a professional design with mechanical feedback. It is ideal for both office work and heavy typing tasks.

4. **Logitech G513 (Romer-G Linear switches)**:
   - **Switch Type**: Romer-G Linear.
   - **Features**: Logitech’s Romer-G Linear switches are quieter than most traditional mechanical switches while still providing a mechanical feel. It’s well-suited for quiet environments and can handle heavy typing.

5. **Cooler Master SK650 (Low-Profile Red switches)**:
   - **Switch Type**: Cherry MX Low-Profile Red.
   - **Features**: This keyboard is quieter due to its low-profile design and smooth Red switches. The shorter travel distance reduces noise when bottoming out keys, making it great for heavy typists.

### Additional Tips for Reducing Typing Noise:
- **Use O-Rings**: Adding O-rings to the keyboard can further reduce noise from keypresses by softening the impact when keys are fully pressed down.
- **Consider a Desk Mat**: A desk mat under the keyboard can absorb some of the noise caused by typing and reduce the overall sound in the workspace.

These keyboards balance the tactile experience of mechanical switches with quieter keypresses, making them great for heavy typists who want to minimize noise.
