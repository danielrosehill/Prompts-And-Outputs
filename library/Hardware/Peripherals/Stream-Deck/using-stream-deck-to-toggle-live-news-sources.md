# Prompt

I have a Stream Deck mini.
Can you think of any ways that I could create a live news monitoring display for Fedora Linux which could toggle between various tabs using the device?
Desktop OS: Fedora Linux

# Output
You can definitely leverage your **Stream Deck Mini** as a controller for toggling between various tabs in a live news monitoring setup on **Fedora Linux**. Below are some ways to accomplish this:

### **1. Using Stream Deck to Control Browser Tabs (via Keyboard Shortcuts)**

#### **Overview**:
You can map your **Stream Deck Mini** buttons to keyboard shortcuts to switch between different browser tabs, allowing you to toggle between live news streams or dashboard views in your browser.

#### **Steps**:
1. **Install the Stream Deck Software on Linux**:
   - The official Elgato Stream Deck software doesn't support Linux, but you can use **open-source alternatives**:
     - **`streamdeck-ui`**: A popular open-source utility that works with Linux and supports customizable key bindings for the Stream Deck.
     - **GitHub Link**: [streamdeck-ui](https://github.com/timothycrosley/streamdeck-ui)

2. **Configure Key Mappings**:
   - Map the buttons on your Stream Deck Mini to specific browser shortcuts. For example:
     - **Ctrl+Tab**: Switches to the next tab in most browsers.
     - **Ctrl+Shift+Tab**: Switches to the previous tab.
     - **Ctrl+1, Ctrl+2, etc.**: Directly jumps to a specific tab (1st, 2nd, etc.).

3. **Add a Custom Icon** (Optional):
   - You can customize the Stream Deck Mini buttons with specific icons for each feed/tab (e.g., CNN, BBC, Reuters).
   - **streamdeck-ui** allows you to upload custom icons for each button, enhancing usability.

#### **Additional Browser Tools**:
- **Tab Management Extensions**: Consider using extensions like **Tab Groups** in Firefox or **Session Buddy** in Chromium-based browsers to organize your live feeds into groups.
- **Assign a Stream Deck Button for Each Feed Group**: You could map specific buttons to open different sets of tabs or pre-configured sessions.

### **2. Automating with Scripting Tools**

#### **Overview**:
You can automate more advanced tab-switching or dashboard toggling workflows using scripting tools like **xdotool** or **AutoKey**, which can then be triggered via the Stream Deck.

#### **Steps**:
1. **Install `xdotool`**:
   - `xdotool` simulates keyboard input and mouse activity from the command line, allowing you to create scripts for switching between applications or tabs.
   - **Install via Fedora**:
     ```bash
     sudo dnf install xdotool
     ```

2. **Create Scripts for Tab Switching**:
   - Write scripts to switch between different tabs or browser windows.
   - For example, to switch to the 1st tab in Firefox, use the following command:
     ```bash
     xdotool search --onlyvisible --class "Firefox" windowactivate key ctrl+1
     ```

3. **Map Scripts to Stream Deck Buttons**:
   - Using `streamdeck-ui`, map these scripts to buttons on your Stream Deck Mini.
   - You can create a separate script for each tab or live feed, allowing you to quickly toggle between them.

4. **Use `AutoKey` for More Advanced Automation**:
   - **AutoKey** is a text expansion and automation utility that can automate actions and map them to keyboard shortcuts.
   - You can configure **AutoKey** to create complex workflows, such as switching between tabs or different applications, and trigger these actions via Stream Deck buttons.
   - **Install AutoKey**:
     ```bash
     sudo dnf install autokey
     ```

### **3. Integrating with a Browser Dashboard (via Custom Browser Extensions)**

#### **Overview**:
You can create a custom browser-based news dashboard that organizes live video streams into one tab and use the Stream Deck Mini to toggle between them. Alternatively, you can configure a browser extension to cycle through different tabs using your Stream Deck.

#### **Steps**:
1. **Create a News Dashboard**:
   - Use an open-source dashboard tool (like **Dashy** or **Home Assistant**) and embed multiple news feeds in one browser tab.
   - Assign each Stream Deck button to toggle between individual live streams within the dashboard or switch to different tabs if you are embedding one news source per tab.

2. **Browser Extensions for Tab Management**:
   - **Tab Master 5000**: This extension for Chromium browsers allows tab navigation through custom shortcuts, which you can map to the Stream Deck Mini.
   - **Tab Wrangler**: An extension that auto-closes inactive tabs and manages open ones. You can configure it to work with Stream Deck by mapping shortcut keys for switching between tabs.

3. **Keyboard Mapping for Browser Tabs**:
   - Assign buttons to tab-related actions like:
     - **Open New Tab** (`Ctrl+T`)
     - **Close Current Tab** (`Ctrl+W`)
     - **Switch Between Tabs** (`Ctrl+Tab`, `Ctrl+Shift+Tab`)

### **4. Use a Tiling Window Manager (e.g., i3)**

#### **Overview**:
With a tiling window manager like **i3**, you can organize different applications (such as browser windows with live news streams) into specific windows and workspaces. Then, you can use the Stream Deck Mini to switch between these workspaces or windows.

#### **Steps**:
1. **Install i3 Window Manager**:
   - Install i3 or another tiling window manager on Fedora:
     ```bash
     sudo dnf install i3
     ```

2. **Configure Workspaces**:
   - Set up different workspaces with specific browser windows for different news streams.
   - You can assign each Stream Deck Mini button to switch between workspaces or windows.

3. **Map Stream Deck to Switch Workspaces**:
   - Use `xdotool` to map commands for switching workspaces, and then configure your Stream Deck buttons to trigger those commands. For example:
     ```bash
     xdotool key super+1  # Switch to workspace 1
     xdotool key super+2  # Switch to workspace 2
     ```

4. **Create Stream Deck Profiles**:
   - For each news feed or workspace, create a Stream Deck profile with custom icons and mapped actions to organize and switch between various live streams.

### **5. Use MPV Media Player for Multistream Toggling**

#### **Overview**:
If your news sources are streams, you can use **MPV Media Player** to handle multiple video streams and map Stream Deck buttons to switch between them.

#### **Steps**:
1. **Install MPV Media Player**:
   - MPV supports live streaming and various video formats, and it's highly scriptable.
   - **Install via Fedora**:
     ```bash
     sudo dnf install mpv
     ```

2. **Script MPV to Switch Streams**:
   - Create scripts to open and toggle between different streams.
   - Example script to open a stream:
     ```bash
     mpv https://your-news-stream-url.com
     ```

3. **Map MPV Scripts to Stream Deck**:
   - Use **streamdeck-ui** to map different streams to the Stream Deck buttons. When pressed, the buttons will switch MPV to the assigned news stream.

### **Security Considerations**:
1. **Ensure Stream Deck Access is Secured**: If you expose this setup for remote access, ensure that access to the device and control software is protected by secure SSH or a VPN.
2. **Use a Reverse Proxy**: If setting up a browser dashboard or web-based dashboard, ensure it is secured with HTTPS and behind a reverse proxy (like **Nginx**) with authentication enabled.

By using these tools and approaches, you can turn your **Stream Deck Mini** into a powerful controller for a live news monitoring dashboard on **Fedora Linux**, allowing you to easily toggle between different live feeds, tabs, and news sources in real-time.
