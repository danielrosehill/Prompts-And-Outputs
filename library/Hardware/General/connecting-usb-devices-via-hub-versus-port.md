Yes, there are practical differences between connecting USB devices directly to a computer's USB port versus using a USB hub:

### 1. **Power Delivery**:
   - **Direct Connection**: Usually provides more power, making it better for devices that need high power (e.g., external hard drives).
   - **USB Hub**: Can be **powered** (with its own power supply) or **unpowered** (drawing power from the computer). Powered hubs are better for multiple devices needing more power.

### 2. **Data Transfer Speeds**:
   - **Direct Connection**: Offers the maximum possible speed based on the port (e.g., USB 3.0).
   - **USB Hub**: Shared bandwidth; multiple devices might reduce effective speeds, especially on unpowered hubs.

### 3. **Device Recognition & Details**:
   - **Direct Connection**: The computer can often access more detailed hardware information, especially if using low-level utilities.
   - **USB Hub**: May limit or obscure certain details (e.g., exact power usage) depending on how the hub handles communication.

### Summary:
Direct connections generally offer better performance and full device visibility, while hubs add flexibility but can introduce power and bandwidth limitations. For detailed diagnostics or high-power needs, direct connections are preferable.
