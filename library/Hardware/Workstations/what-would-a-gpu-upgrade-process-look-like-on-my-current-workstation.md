The process of upgrading your GPU in your current system is relatively straightforward but comes with a few risks and considerations. Here’s a step-by-step guide for the GPU upgrade process, followed by an assessment of the risks:

### GPU Upgrade Process

1. **Prepare Your System:**
   - **Backup important data**: Though a GPU upgrade shouldn't affect your data, it's always good practice to back up any critical data before hardware upgrades.
   - **Uninstall Current GPU Drivers**: Before removing the old GPU, uninstall the current AMD drivers. This can help avoid driver conflicts when the new GPU is installed. You can use software like `amdgpu-uninstall` on Linux to handle this.

2. **Power Down and Open the Case:**
   - **Turn off the PC** and **disconnect the power supply**.
   - **Open the case** (your Pure Base 500 has tool-less screws, making this easy).

3. **Remove the Old GPU:**
   - **Disconnect the power connectors** from your current GPU (ensure that all PCIe power cables are removed).
   - Unscrew the GPU from the PCIe bracket.
   - **Carefully release the PCIe latch** at the base of the GPU (this is often a small clip).
   - **Pull the GPU out of the PCIe slot gently**.

4. **Install the New GPU:**
   - **Insert the new GPU** into the PCIe x16 slot. Ensure that it’s firmly seated and the PCIe latch clicks back into place.
   - **Screw the GPU into place** at the PCIe bracket.
   - **Reconnect the PCIe power cables** (ensure your power supply can handle the new GPU’s requirements).

5. **Power On and Install New Drivers:**
   - Power on your system and boot into Fedora Linux.
   - **Install the new GPU drivers**. For AMD cards, you can use open-source drivers, but make sure they support your new GPU model (you may need to update your system to the latest kernel for newer GPU support).

6. **Check Performance:**
   - Once the drivers are installed, monitor the system to ensure the GPU is functioning correctly. You can run benchmarks or stress tests to verify its performance.

### Risks Involved

1. **Power Supply Capacity**:
   - Your power supply is a **850W Seasonic Gold 80+**, which is ample for most high-end GPUs. However, if you upgrade to a significantly more powerful GPU (such as an Nvidia RTX 4080 or AMD RX 7900 XT), you should verify that the PSU can handle the additional power draw. A mismatch could lead to system instability or failure to boot.

2. **Physical Space and Compatibility**:
   - Ensure that the new GPU physically fits into your case. GPUs like the RTX 4080 are larger than standard models, and while your Pure Base 500 case should accommodate most GPUs, it’s always a good idea to check dimensions.

3. **Driver Compatibility**:
   - Since you're using Fedora Linux, ensure that the new GPU is well-supported by the latest kernel and open-source drivers (AMDGPU or Mesa for AMD, Nouveau or proprietary drivers for Nvidia). Driver issues can cause performance problems or prevent the system from booting correctly.

4. **PCIe Slot Damage**:
   - Careful handling is required when inserting or removing the GPU to avoid damaging the PCIe slot on the motherboard. Damaging the PCIe slot could render the slot unusable or lead to motherboard issues.

5. **Heat Management**:
   - High-end GPUs often run hotter. Although you have a good case and cooler, upgrading to a more powerful GPU may require better airflow or additional cooling solutions. Poor thermal management can cause the GPU or other components to throttle or overheat, impacting performance and longevity.

6. **BIOS Compatibility**:
   - In rare cases, some new GPUs may require a BIOS update for full compatibility with your motherboard. Before upgrading, check for any available BIOS updates for your MSI Pro B760M-A motherboard.

### Overall Risk Level: **Low to Moderate**
The risks in upgrading a GPU are generally low if you follow the steps carefully and ensure that the new GPU is compatible with your system’s power supply, physical space, and operating system. The main concerns would be ensuring proper driver support on Fedora and making sure the power supply and cooling are adequate for the new card.
