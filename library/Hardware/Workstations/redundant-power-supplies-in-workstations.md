# Prompt

Redundant power supplies is interesting. Can you give me examples of how this can be integrated into workstations? Do such things as internal PSUs exist?

# Output

Redundant power supplies can indeed be integrated into workstations, though they are more commonly found in servers and enterprise-grade equipment. However, there are some options for workstations:

1. Dual Internal PSUs: Some high-end workstation cases and motherboards support dual power supply units. These are rare in consumer-grade equipment but can be found in some professional workstation builds. For example:

   - Some Supermicro workstation motherboards support redundant PSUs.
   - Certain HP Z-series workstations have options for redundant power supplies.

2. External Redundant PSU Systems: These are more common and can be added to existing workstations:

   - APC Redundant Switch: This device allows you to connect two separate power supplies to a single computer, providing redundancy.
   - Powertek Redundant Power System: Offers external redundant power for workstations and servers.

3. Server-Grade Components in Workstations: Some enthusiasts and professionals build workstations using server-grade components that support redundant power:

   - Using a server motherboard in a large workstation case can allow for dual PSU setups.
   - Some high-end EATX cases are designed to accommodate dual PSUs.

4. UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply): While not strictly a redundant PSU, a good UPS can provide power backup and protection for workstations.

5. Custom Solutions: Some companies offer custom-built workstations with redundant power options, though these are typically for specialized industries.

It's worth noting that true internal redundant PSUs are less common in workstations compared to servers. This is because:

1. Space constraints in typical workstation cases.
2. Lower criticality of individual workstations compared to servers.
3. Cost considerations - redundant PSUs add significant expense.

For most workstation users, a high-quality single PSU combined with a good UPS is often sufficient. However, for mission-critical workstations where downtime is unacceptable, exploring redundant power options can be worthwhile.
