# Prompt

Are there any manufacturers which stand out for their focus on supporting high end workstations and which have retained a strong focus on this segment of the market?

# Output

Based on the information provided and my knowledge of the workstation market, a few manufacturers stand out for their continued focus on high-end workstations:

1. Dell: Dell's Precision line of workstations, particularly models like the Precision 7865 Tower, demonstrate a strong commitment to the high-end workstation market. They offer systems with powerful processors like AMD Threadripper Pro and support for professional-grade GPUs[4].

2. HP: The HP Z series, especially models like the Z8 Fury G5, showcases HP's dedication to extreme performance workstations. These systems support the latest Intel Xeon processors and can be configured with multiple high-end GPUs for demanding workflows[6].

3. Lenovo: While not explicitly mentioned in the provided information, Lenovo's ThinkStation line is well-known in the workstation space, offering powerful configurations for professional users.

4. Falcon Northwest: Although a smaller company compared to the big OEMs, Falcon Northwest has carved out a niche in high-performance workstations. Their Talon model, which supports AMD Threadripper Pro processors, has been noted for its blazing performance and competitive pricing in the high-end workstation segment[7].

5. Puget Systems: This company specializes in custom-built workstations tailored for specific professional needs. They offer a wide range of processor options and cutting-edge components, making them a strong player in the custom workstation market[5].

6. Broadberry: While perhaps less well-known globally, Broadberry has a strong focus on high-performance workstations, offering systems with both Intel Xeon and AMD EPYC processors. They cater to demanding enterprise applications and have served major organizations[6].

These manufacturers have retained a strong focus on the high-end workstation segment, continually updating their offerings with the latest processors, GPUs, and other technologies to meet the needs of professionals in fields like 3D rendering, scientific computing, AI/ML, and other compute-intensive disciplines.
