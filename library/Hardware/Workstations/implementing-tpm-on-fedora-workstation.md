### What is TPM (Trusted Platform Module)?
A **TPM (Trusted Platform Module)** is a hardware chip that enhances security by providing hardware-based encryption and authentication. It's typically used for operations like encryption key storage, hardware-based authentication, and verifying system integrity.

### Implementation of TPM on Your Workstation

#### 1. **Check TPM Compatibility**:
   - Your **MSI Pro B760M-A WiFi** motherboard is compatible with TPM 2.0 modules. Typically, MSI motherboards have a TPM header where you can install a dedicated TPM chip if it's not already built into the motherboard.

#### 2. **Purchase a TPM 2.0 Module**:
   - **MSI TPM 2.0 Module**: This is the specific module that works with your motherboard. These modules are usually small and plug directly into the TPM header on the motherboard.

#### 3. **Install the TPM Module**:
   - Find the **TPM header** on your motherboard (consult the manual to locate it). The installation process involves:
     1. Power down your system and unplug all power sources.
     2. Insert the TPM chip into the header.
     3. Reconnect power and boot into your BIOS/UEFI.

#### 4. **Enable TPM in BIOS/UEFI**:
   - After installing the TPM chip, boot into your system's BIOS by pressing a designated key (usually **DEL** or **F2**) during startup.
   - Navigate to the **Security** section and enable the TPM option. On some systems, this might be labeled as **Intel PTT** (Platform Trust Technology) for CPUs that have built-in TPM functionality.
   - Save and exit the BIOS.

#### 5. **Configure TPM in Fedora**:
   - Once TPM is enabled, Fedora will recognize it as a hardware security device.
   - You can use it for full-disk encryption (with tools like **LUKS**), secure boot, or even for securing authentication mechanisms (like pairing with a YubiKey).

### Benefits of TPM

1. **Secure Boot**:
   - Ensures that only trusted software and firmware are loaded when the system boots up. If unauthorized changes are detected (e.g., malware attempts), the boot process can be halted or alerted.
  
2. **Encryption (Full Disk Encryption)**:
   - The TPM stores encryption keys that unlock your disk at startup. Without the TPM, the keys aren't available, meaning a thief can't access your data by removing your hard drive.
  
3. **Authentication**:
   - You can use TPM for multi-factor authentication, working alongside a YubiKey or a smart card.

4. **Software Attestation**:
   - TPM can check the integrity of the system software and firmware. It measures system states during boot and provides a verifiable report for security purposes.

5. **Securing Credentials**:
   - TPM can store cryptographic keys and passwords in a way that makes it extremely hard for hackers to extract them, even if they gain access to the system.

### Costs of TPM 2.0 Hardware
- A **TPM 2.0 module** (like the MSI TPM 2.0) generally costs between **$20 and $50**, depending on the retailer and availability. Prices can vary slightly by region.

### Why Use TPM?
- Implementing a TPM module significantly increases your system's resilience against malware, tampering, and unauthorized data access, especially if you handle sensitive data or require compliance with security standards. It works particularly well in combination with disk encryption (e.g., **LUKS**) and secure boot processes.
