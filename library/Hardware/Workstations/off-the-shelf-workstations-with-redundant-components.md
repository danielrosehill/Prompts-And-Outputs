### Key Benefits of Redundant PSUs in Workstations:
- **Increased Uptime**: Redundant PSUs automatically switch to the backup unit if the primary PSU fails, ensuring the workstation remains operational without interruptions.
- **Hot-Swappable PSUs**: Many workstations with redundant PSUs allow for **hot-swapping**, meaning you can replace a failed PSU without shutting down the system.
- **Designed for Mission-Critical Applications**: These workstations are typically used in scenarios where uptime and reliability are essential, such as for data-intensive computations, AI training, or video rendering.

### Conclusion
If you need a workstation with built-in redundancy for maximum reliability, systems like the **HP Z8 G4**, **Dell Precision 7920**, and **Lenovo ThinkStation P920** are excellent options. These machines offer customizable configurations with redundant PSUs, making them suitable for enterprise and mission-critical applications.
