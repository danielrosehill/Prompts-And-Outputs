# Prompt

Here are a copy of my desktop specs. I'm running Fedora Workstation 40. 

Please write a report suggesting two things:

1) Any software I should install to ensure that the system is in running order

2) A backup approach that might work

# Output

Based on your desktop specifications and the fact that you're running Fedora Workstation 40, here's a report suggesting software to install and a backup approach:

## Software Recommendations

To ensure your system is in optimal running order, consider installing the following:

1. **System Utilities**:
   - GNOME Tweaks: This tool allows you to fine-tune various aspects of your GNOME desktop environment[5].
   ```
   sudo dnf install gnome-tweaks
   ```

2. **Hardware Management**:
   - TLP: This power management tool is essential for optimizing battery life on laptops[5].
   ```
   sudo dnf install tlp tlp-rdw
   ```

3. **Additional Repositories**:
   - Enable RPM Fusion: This will give you access to additional packages, including non-free ones[5].
   ```
   sudo dnf install https://download1.rpmfusion.org/free/fedora/rpmfusion-free-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm
   sudo dnf install https://download1.rpmfusion.org/nonfree/fedora/rpmfusion-nonfree-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm
   ```

4. **Development Tools**:
   - Visual Studio Code or Neovim: For programming and text editing[7].
   - GCC: Essential for compiling software[7].
   ```
   sudo dnf install gcc
   ```

5. **Multimedia Software**:
   - VLC: A versatile media player[5].
   ```
   sudo dnf install vlc
   ```

6. **Utility Software**:
   - Unzip, p7zip, and unrar: For handling compressed files[5].
   ```
   sudo dnf install unzip p7zip p7zip-plugins unrar
   ```

## Backup Approach

Given your system specifications and Fedora Workstation 40, here's a recommended backup approach:

1. **Use BTRFS Snapshots**:
   Your system likely uses BTRFS as the default filesystem. Leverage this by using BTRBK for system snapshots[2][3].

2. **Implement a Multi-Tiered Backup Strategy**:
   - **Local Backups**: Use Borg Backup with Vorta as a GUI for local backups to an external drive[6].
   - **Remote Backups**: Implement Restic for cloud backups, which supports various backends including Backblaze B2[6].

3. **Backup Schedule**:
   - Set up daily local snapshots with BTRBK.
   - Configure weekly full backups to an external drive using Borg/Vorta.
   - Schedule daily incremental backups to a cloud service using Restic.

4. **What to Backup**:
   - System files (excluding /home if on a separate partition)
   - Home directory
   - List of installed packages

5. **Automation**:
   - Use systemd timers to automate your backup processes[6].

6. **Verification and Testing**:
   - Regularly test your backups by performing test restores.

To implement this:

1. Install necessary tools:
   ```
   sudo dnf install btrbk borgbackup vorta restic
   ```

2. Set up BTRBK for system snapshots.

3. Configure Borg/Vorta for local backups to an external drive.

4. Set up Restic for cloud backups, potentially to Backblaze B2.

5. Create systemd timers to automate these backup processes.

This approach provides a comprehensive backup strategy with both local and off-site backups, leveraging your system's BTRFS filesystem and providing multiple restore points and backup locations for added security.
