# Prompt

Here is the hardware specification on my workstation. If I wanted to maximise the storage capcaity of this device, what drives should I buy? How many drives could I possibly connect to this computer considering both the limitations posed by the motherboard and the PSU

# Output

Based on your workstation's specifications, here are recommendations to maximize storage capacity while considering the limitations of your motherboard and power supply:

## Current Storage Configuration

Your system currently has:
- 1x NVME drive (931.51GiB)
- 2x SSDs (929.93GiB and 931.51GiB)

## Motherboard Limitations

Your MSI PRO B760M-A WIFI motherboard provides[3]:
- 2x M.2 slots supporting PCIe 4.0 x4
- 4x SATA 6G ports

## Maximizing Storage Capacity

To maximize storage, consider the following upgrades:

1. **M.2 NVMe SSDs:**
   - Replace existing NVMe drive with a 4TB PCIe 4.0 NVMe SSD (e.g., Sabrent Rocket 4 Plus 4TB)
   - Add another 4TB PCIe 4.0 NVMe SSD in the second M.2 slot

2. **SATA SSDs:**
   - Replace existing SATA SSDs with larger capacity drives
   - Consider 4x 8TB 2.5" SATA SSDs (e.g., Teamgroup QX 8TB)

## Total Potential Capacity

- 2x 4TB NVMe SSDs = 8TB
- 4x 8TB SATA SSDs = 32TB
- Total potential capacity: 40TB

## Power Supply Considerations

Your Seasonic Focus GX-850 850W power supply should be sufficient to handle these drives[2]. It provides:
- 10x SATA power connectors
- Ample wattage for additional drives

## Additional Considerations

1. **Cooling:** Ensure proper airflow for multiple high-capacity SSDs, especially for the M.2 drives.

2. **RAID:** Your motherboard supports RAID 0, 1, 5, and 10 for SATA devices, which could be used for improved performance or redundancy[3].

3. **Future-proofing:** While 8TB SATA SSDs are currently the largest widely available, larger capacities may become available in the future[6].

4. **Budget:** High-capacity SSDs can be expensive. Consider balancing capacity with cost-effectiveness.

5. **Performance:** NVMe drives will offer significantly higher speeds compared to SATA SSDs.

By implementing these upgrades, you can significantly increase your storage capacity while staying within the limitations of your current hardware. Remember to consider your specific storage needs and budget when making final decisions.
