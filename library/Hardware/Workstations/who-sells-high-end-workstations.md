# Prompt

Can you recommend some places to buy these workstations? Can you buy them from general computer stores or are they more typically available through specialist sources?  If I wanted to buy the HP model in Israel, who might I buy from?

# Output

You can buy high-end workstations like the **HP Z8 G4** directly from **HP's official site** in Israel. The HP Z8 G4 is designed specifically for heavy-duty tasks like complex simulations, video editing, and 3D rendering. It can be configured with dual Intel Xeon CPUs, up to 56 cores, and multiple GPUs, making it suitable for professionals in fields like **AI research**, **architecture**, and **media production**【80†source】【81†source】.

For specialist high-performance workstations, you can also check **authorized HP resellers** or **enterprise IT providers** that deal with high-end hardware. In Israel, specialized IT resellers that cater to business solutions and enterprise-level hardware (such as **system integrators** or **enterprise IT stores**) are more likely to stock these machines.

If you want a more customized or flexible workstation solution, it is often better to go through these **specialist sources** than general computer stores, as they will have the expertise and options for configuring the machine exactly to your performance requirements.
