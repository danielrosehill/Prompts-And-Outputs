# Prompt

Please calculate what my capacity would be after the backup. Based on my current resource usage, please also calculate what percentage of the drive would be full and what my remaining storage capacity would be

# Output

Based on the provided calculations and your current storage usage, I'll summarize the capacity changes after converting to RAID1 and provide the requested information.

## Capacity After RAID1 Conversion

Your total capacity after converting to RAID1 would be approximately **1396.48 GiB** (1.36 TiB).

## Usage Percentage After Conversion

Your current usage is 226.66 GiB.

Percentage of drive full after RAID1 conversion:
(226.66 GiB / 1396.48 GiB) * 100 ≈ **16.23%**

## Remaining Storage Capacity

Remaining storage capacity after RAID1 conversion:
1396.48 GiB - 226.66 GiB ≈ **1169.82 GiB** (1.14 TiB)

## Summary

After converting to RAID1:
- Total capacity: 1396.48 GiB (1.36 TiB)
- Used space: 226.66 GiB
- Percentage full: 16.23%
- Remaining capacity: 1169.82 GiB (1.14 TiB)
