# Prompt

Here is the terminal output that might show my current RAID.

Please describe what I have going:

```
sudo btrfs filesystem df /              
Data, RAID1: total=244.00GiB, used=241.83GiB  
System, RAID1: total=32.00MiB, used=64.00KiB  
Metadata, RAID1: total=7.00GiB, used=6.06GiB  
GlobalReserve, single: total=512.00MiB, used=0.00B
```

# Output

Based on the output you provided, here's a description of your current RAID implementation on the Btrfs system:

1. **Data:**
   - Your data is stored using **RAID1**, which means that your data is mirrored across two or more devices. This ensures redundancy by maintaining identical copies of your data on multiple devices. 
   - The total data allocated for RAID1 is **244.00 GiB**, and **241.83 GiB** is currently used.

2. **System:**
   - The system data (important internal Btrfs data structures) is also using **RAID1**, providing redundancy by mirroring system metadata.
   - The total system data allocated is **32.00 MiB**, and **64.00 KiB** is used.

3. **Metadata:**
   - Metadata (the filesystem structure itself) is using **RAID1**, meaning that the metadata is mirrored across two or more devices to provide redundancy and ensure filesystem integrity in case of device failure.
   - The total metadata allocated is **7.00 GiB**, and **6.06 GiB** is used.

4. **Global Reserve:**
   - The global reserve is using a **single** configuration, meaning this space is not mirrored or distributed across multiple devices. The global reserve is typically used by the filesystem to handle temporary overcommit situations (such as allocations exceeding available space).
   - The total allocated for the global reserve is **512.00 MiB**, and none of it is currently used (`0.00B`).

### Summary:
Your current Btrfs setup is configured with **RAID1** for both data, system, and metadata, providing redundancy for critical filesystem structures and your data. RAID1 ensures that in the event of a drive failure, no data will be lost as it is mirrored across multiple devices. The global reserve is in a non-redundant, single configuration, but this is not typically a cause for concern as it's mainly used for temporary space management by the filesystem.
