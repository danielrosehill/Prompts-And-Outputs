# Prompt

I'm currently using a multi drive BTRFS array. I want to move over to any type of RAID that will give me redundancy so that my workstation can remain operational in the event of a disk failure. Could you give me step by step instructions on how to migrate over to this?

# Output

Based on your setup, with three storage devices of nearly identical sizes, the most suitable RAID configuration for redundancy would be **RAID1** on your BTRFS array. RAID1 mirrors data across two drives, providing redundancy in the event of a disk failure, which will allow your workstation to continue operating if one drive fails. With three devices, BTRFS will automatically handle the third drive, offering a level of redundancy beyond traditional RAID1 by dynamically balancing and utilizing the available space across all three drives.

Here's a step-by-step guide to convert your BTRFS array to RAID1 for redundancy:

### Step-by-Step Instructions for Moving to RAID1

#### Step 1: Backup Your Data
Ensure you have a complete backup of your data as a precaution before proceeding with any RAID changes.

#### Step 2: Install Necessary Tools
1. Open a terminal.
2. Install BTRFS management tools:
   ```bash
   sudo dnf install btrfs-progs
   ```

#### Step 3: Convert BTRFS Array to RAID1
1. Run the following command to convert your existing BTRFS array to RAID1:
   ```bash
   sudo btrfs balance start -dconvert=raid1 -mconvert=raid1 -f /
   ```
   This command:
   - Converts data (`-dconvert=raid1`) to RAID1, which mirrors data across drives.
   - Converts metadata (`-mconvert=raid1`) to RAID1 for additional redundancy.

2. To monitor the conversion progress, use:
   ```bash
   sudo btrfs balance status /
   ```

#### Step 4: Verify RAID Configuration
1. Once the balance operation is complete, confirm the RAID configuration with:
   ```bash
   sudo btrfs filesystem df /
   ```
   This should show that both `Data` and `Metadata` are now in RAID1 mode.

#### Step 5: Reboot and Check
1. Reboot your workstation to ensure everything is working correctly.
2. After rebooting, you can verify that the conversion was successful by running:
   ```bash
   sudo btrfs filesystem show /
   ```
   You should see that your filesystem is now configured with RAID1 redundancy.

### Summary of Recommended RAID Option

Moving to **RAID1** will provide redundancy, ensuring that your workstation can continue to operate in the event of a single disk failure. RAID1 will mirror your data across the NVME, SSD1, and SSD2, achieving the redundancy you need.
