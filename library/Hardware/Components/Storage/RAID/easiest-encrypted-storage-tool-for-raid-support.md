# Prompt

No I'm looking at the folder based approach. Veracrypt looks nice but it seems to detect my RAID as a bunch of different volumes

# Output

For folder-based encryption on a RAID system, especially since VeraCrypt is detecting your RAID array as multiple volumes, you may want to consider alternatives that handle folder-level encryption more gracefully and don’t conflict with RAID setups. Here's a refined look at the best folder-based approaches that will work smoothly with your RAID and BTRFS setup:

### 1. **eCryptfs**
   - **Description**: eCryptfs is a lightweight encryption tool that encrypts individual directories at the filesystem level. It’s ideal for users who want to encrypt specific folders without affecting the entire filesystem or RAID array.
   - **Compatibility with RAID**: 
     - **No RAID Conflict**: Since eCryptfs works on top of any filesystem, it won’t interfere with your RAID setup. It will treat the BTRFS RAID array as a normal filesystem and encrypt folders on top of it.
     - **Folder-Level Encryption**: eCryptfs provides encryption only for the folders you choose, making it efficient for securing specific sensitive data.
   - **How to Use**:
     1. **Install eCryptfs**:
        ```bash
        sudo dnf install ecryptfs-utils
        ```
     2. **Encrypt a Directory**:
        - Mount an encrypted directory:
        ```bash
        sudo mount -t ecryptfs /path/to/folder /path/to/folder
        ```
        - You’ll be prompted for a passphrase and other encryption options (choose AES and a key size of 256 bits for strong encryption).
     3. **Access the Encrypted Directory**: Once mounted, the directory is decrypted, and you can access the contents. Unmount it when you want to secure it again.
   - **Advantages**: 
     - No need to manage volumes or deal with RAID recognition issues.
     - Transparent encryption and decryption.
   - **RRP**: Free and open-source.

### 2. **EncFS**
   - **Description**: EncFS is another option for per-directory encryption. It encrypts files at the filesystem level, working like eCryptfs but with slightly different implementation details. EncFS creates encrypted directories that behave like regular folders when mounted.
   - **Compatibility with RAID**:
     - **No RAID Conflict**: Like eCryptfs, EncFS will work smoothly on top of your RAID system, treating the BTRFS array as a normal filesystem. There’s no need for special configuration with RAID.
     - **Folder-Level Encryption**: You can create encrypted directories anywhere on your filesystem.
   - **How to Use**:
     1. **Install EncFS**:
        ```bash
        sudo dnf install encfs
        ```
     2. **Create an Encrypted Directory**:
        - To create an encrypted directory:
        ```bash
        encfs /path/to/encrypted-folder /path/to/mount-point
        ```
        - You’ll be prompted for a password and encryption options.
     3. **Mount and Unmount**: Mount the directory when needed and unmount it when done:
        ```bash
        fusermount -u /path/to/mount-point
        ```
   - **Advantages**: 
     - Easy setup and doesn’t interfere with the RAID array.
     - Transparent encryption for individual files.
   - **RRP**: Free and open-source.

### Recommendations for Folder-Based Encryption on RAID:
1. **eCryptfs** and **EncFS** are the most seamless options for folder-based encryption on a RAID array. Both tools provide transparent, per-folder encryption and integrate well with your BTRFS RAID1 setup without treating the RAID array as multiple volumes.
   
2. **Tomb** is another great option if you prefer to use a vault-based approach but don’t want to run into the multi-volume issue that VeraCrypt is encountering. Tomb’s encrypted containers work perfectly on top of RAID-managed filesystems.

### Why eCryptfs or EncFS Might Be the Best Fit:
- **No RAID Interference**: These tools won’t interfere with your RAID array, unlike VeraCrypt, which detects RAID volumes individually. They focus on encrypting individual directories.
- **Simple Folder Encryption**: Both allow for easy encryption of specific directories without needing to manage containers or worry about multiple RAID volumes.
- **Transparency**: Once a folder is mounted, the encryption is transparent, allowing you to use files just like normal directories.
