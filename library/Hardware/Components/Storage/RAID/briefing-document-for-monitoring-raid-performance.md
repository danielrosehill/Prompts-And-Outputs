# Prompt

Thanks. Please create a new document for me as the admin. Explain how to monitor the transition to RAID1. Tell me these commands for post migration. And give me also a guide on how I can make sure the RAID array is working as expected going foward

# Output

Here’s a guide that you can use as an admin for monitoring the transition to RAID1 on Fedora Workstation 40. This document will cover commands to monitor the RAID1 setup during and after migration and instructions on how to ensure that the RAID array is functioning as expected.

# Admin Guide: Monitoring RAID1 Setup and Post-Migration Health Checks

## 1. Monitoring the Transition to RAID1

During the RAID1 synchronization process, it’s essential to track the progress and ensure the array is building correctly. Use these commands for real-time monitoring:

### Check Synchronization Progress
```bash
cat /proc/mdstat
```
This command provides a real-time view of the RAID array status. Look for information on:
- **Syncing Progress**: You should see a percentage indicator for the rebuild process.
- **Devices**: Confirm that both SSDs are recognized as active components.

### View RAID Array Details
```bash
mdadm --detail /dev/mdX
```
Replace `/dev/mdX` with your RAID array device (e.g., `/dev/md0`). This will show:
- **Status**: Should show “active” or “clean” if the array is properly synchronized.
- **Devices**: Both devices should be listed as “active sync.”
  
### Review System Logs for Errors
```bash
journalctl -xe | grep mdadm
```
This command filters system logs to show any RAID-specific messages. Look for error messages or warnings related to the RAID setup.

## 2. Post-Migration Health Checks

After the RAID1 array reaches 100%, follow these steps to confirm that it’s functioning correctly:

### Confirm Array Status
```bash
mdadm --detail /dev/mdX
```
Ensure that:
- The RAID array status reads “active.”
- Both SSDs are listed under “Active Devices.”

### Check for Disk Failures
```bash
smartctl -H /dev/sdX
```
Run this command for each SSD (replace `/dev/sdX` with the actual device names, like `/dev/sda`). The output should indicate the disk health as "PASSED." If you see anything other than "PASSED," the disk may be failing.

### Generate RAID Event Report
```bash
mdadm --monitor --scan --test
```
This command runs a test event to verify RAID notifications. Confirm that the output indicates successful event reporting without errors.

## 3. Ongoing Monitoring and Maintenance

To ensure the RAID1 array continues to operate as expected, set up periodic checks:

### Set Up Automatic Checks
Add a cron job to periodically verify RAID health:
```bash
crontab -e
```
Add the following line to run a daily RAID check:
```bash
0 3 * * * mdadm --monitor --scan --oneshot
```

### Monitor RAID1 Status Periodically
Run this command to get a quick health check anytime:
```bash
cat /proc/mdstat
```

### Set Up Email Alerts
To receive email notifications about RAID issues:
1. Configure the `mdadm` monitoring service to send alerts:
   ```bash
   mdadm --monitor --scan --mail=your-email@example.com --delay=300
   ```
2. Make sure your system’s mail service is configured and operational.

### Check Array’s Degraded Mode
If one of the drives fails, the RAID array will enter a degraded mode:
```bash
mdadm --detail /dev/mdX
```
In this case, you will see the array status as “degraded.” To replace a failed drive, consult the RAID documentation for instructions on adding a new drive to the array.

By following these steps, you’ll ensure that your RAID1 array remains stable and operational, with alerts in place to handle any potential issues.
