# Prompt

Thanks for that. Is there any way to consolidate the commands so that one command can be issued which will begin the migration and automatically start a monitoring window?

# Output

You can consolidate the commands into a single line that initiates the RAID1 conversion and then starts monitoring in real-time. By using `&&` to chain commands, the monitoring command will run immediately after the conversion starts. Hereâ€™s how to do it:

```bash
sudo btrfs balance start -dconvert=raid1 -mconvert=raid1 -v -f / && watch -n 5 'sudo btrfs balance status /'
```

### Explanation:
- `sudo btrfs balance start -dconvert=raid1 -mconvert=raid1 -v -f /`: Starts the RAID1 conversion with verbose output.
- `&&`: Ensures that the second command only runs if the first command initiates successfully.
- `watch -n 5 'sudo btrfs balance status /'`: Refreshes the balance status every 5 seconds, providing real-time updates on the conversion progress.

This single command will both start the RAID1 migration and open a monitoring window that updates every 5 seconds, allowing you to track the conversion process continuously. You can adjust the interval (`-n 5`) to suit your preference.
