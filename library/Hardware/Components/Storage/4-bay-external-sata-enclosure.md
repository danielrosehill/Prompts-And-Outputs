Most commercially available external **4-drive enclosures** are designed to connect to computers via **USB or eSATA**, and are intended for easy expansion of storage with the convenience of external drives. However, these aren't typically designed for direct **SATA-to-motherboard** connections, where each drive uses its own **SATA data cable** connected directly to the motherboard. While there are few enclosures explicitly designed for this exact setup, you can build or adapt certain enclosures or multi-drive housings for this purpose.

Here are some options and approaches that come close to your specific need:

### 1. **DIY External Drive Enclosures with SATA Extensions**
   - **How it works**: Use a standard multi-bay **hot-swap enclosure** (like those designed for servers) and adapt it to house drives externally. You can route **SATA extension cables** from your motherboard's SATA ports, out of your case, and into the enclosure. Pair this with an external power supply for the drives.
   - **Example Products**: 
     - **ICY DOCK** makes internal 4- or 5-bay enclosures for hot-swappable drives. You can use a chassis like the [ICY DOCK ToughArmor MB607SP-B](https://www.icydock.com/goods.php?id=283) in a DIY setup to house the drives externally.
     - **SATA extension cables**: Run cables directly from the motherboard through a PCI slot cover.
   - **Pros**: Gives you flexibility for high-speed direct SATA connections.
   - **Cons**: Requires a DIY setup, and thereâ€™s no dedicated "external" enclosure made specifically for this use case.

### 2. **NAS Boxes with SATA Mode**
   - **How it works**: Some NAS enclosures have an option to be configured in **SATA mode**, allowing drives to be connected to the motherboard. In this configuration, they essentially act as external housing for multiple drives that connect via SATA. However, many of these enclosures may need tweaking to ensure they work for direct SATA connectivity.
   - **Example Product**: While less common, some NAS models from **QNAP** or **Synology** may have such capabilities if reconfigured or adapted for direct drive access.

### 3. **External Hot-Swap Bays**
   - **How it works**: A hot-swap external bay, like the **StarTech HSB430SATBK**, is a more conventional option. These are intended for server or workstation use and support **direct SATA connections** from multiple drives to the motherboard. However, they still usually require a bit of a custom setup for routing the SATA cables outside the case.
   - **Example Product**: [StarTech 4-Bay SATA Hard Drive Enclosure](https://www.startech.com/en-us/hdd/hsb430satbk).
   - **Pros**: Designed for professional use, highly modular.
   - **Cons**: Typically used internally, but can be adapted for external setups.

### 4. **Server Hot-Swap Rack Solutions**
   - **How it works**: Professional-grade server hardware like **Supermicro** chassis often have drive cages that support hot-swappable drives using direct SATA connections. These can sometimes be adapted for desktop use, but they are usually larger and more expensive, requiring custom configurations.
   - **Example Product**: **Supermicro SuperChassis 4-Bay Hot-Swap**.
   - **Pros**: Built for heavy-duty, multiple drive connections.
   - **Cons**: Designed for servers, so more complex to set up externally.

### Recommendations:
Since commercially available enclosures specifically for external SATA-to-motherboard connections are rare, your best option would be a **DIY solution** using:
- A **multi-bay hot-swap enclosure** like those from **ICY DOCK**.
- **SATA extension cables** routed through the back of your case.
- An **external power supply** to power the drives, such as those designed for SATA hard drives.

This gives you direct SATA connectivity with your drives stored outside the case, while avoiding the slower speeds of USB or network-based solutions like NAS.
