# Prompt

let's say each config text is 500 characters and that there are 300 texts. how much would the rewriting take with gpt 3.5?

# Output

To calculate the cost of rewriting 300 configuration texts with GPT-3.5, we'll break it down into **token usage** and **OpenAI pricing**.

### 1. **Understanding Tokens:**
   - GPT-3.5 **counts characters as tokens**. Generally, 1 token is about 4 characters of English text, including spaces and punctuation.
   - **500 characters** (each config text) equates to roughly **125 tokens** per text.
   - **Total tokens for 300 texts**:  
     125 tokens/text * 300 texts = **37,500 tokens**.

### 2. **GPT-3.5 Pricing** (as of now):
   - The cost for GPT-3.5-turbo is **$0.0015 per 1,000 tokens**.

### 3. **Calculating the Cost**:
   - **Token usage for input**: For each text of 500 characters (125 tokens), GPT-3.5 will also generate a response of roughly the same length. Letâ€™s assume an additional 125 tokens per text for output.
     - Total tokens per request = 125 tokens (input) + 125 tokens (output) = **250 tokens**.
   - **Total tokens for 300 texts** = 250 tokens/text * 300 texts = **75,000 tokens**.
   - **Cost**: 75,000 tokens / 1,000 tokens = **75 units**.
   - **Price**: 75 units * $0.0015 = **$0.1125**.

### **Total Estimated Cost**:
For rewriting **300 texts of 500 characters each**, the cost would be approximately **$0.11** using GPT-3.5-turbo.

This is a rough estimate based on standard token usage patterns, and actual costs may vary slightly depending on the specific prompts and responses. However, it's safe to say the cost would be **well under $1** for this batch of text rewrites.
