# Prompt

I think the problem with AdminJS is that the documentation for working with Mongo is quite poor. Do any of these other tools really excel in that department?

# Output

Based on the information provided and your concern about AdminJS documentation for MongoDB, here are some insights on alternative tools that may have better documentation or ease of use with MongoDB:

1. MongoDB Compass:
   - This is the official GUI for MongoDB, developed by MongoDB itself.
   - It's likely to have the most up-to-date and comprehensive documentation for working with MongoDB.
   - The tool is specifically designed for MongoDB, so it should cover all MongoDB-specific features and use cases.

2. Forest Admin:
   - While not MongoDB-specific, Forest Admin seems to have good documentation and support for MongoDB integration.
   - They specifically mention the ability to flatten nested fields in MongoDB, which could be useful.
   - Their documentation appears to be comprehensive and user-friendly.

3. Mongoose:
   - Although not an admin panel itself, Mongoose is an ODM (Object Document Mapper) for MongoDB in Node.js environments.
   - It has extensive documentation and a large community, which can be helpful when building custom admin interfaces.
   - If you're comfortable with coding, using Mongoose alongside a frontend framework could give you more control and better documentation.

4. DronaHQ:
   - While it's a more general low-code platform, it offers MongoDB integration and seems to have good documentation.
   - It might be a good option if you want to quickly build a custom GUI for your MongoDB data.

5. Robo 3T (formerly Robomongo):
   - This is a popular, lightweight MongoDB GUI.
   - While not as feature-rich as some other options, it's known for its simplicity and ease of use.
   - It has a good reputation in the MongoDB community, which often translates to better community support and resources.

Among these, MongoDB Compass stands out as potentially having the best documentation and native support for MongoDB features, given that it's developed by MongoDB itself. However, if you're looking for a more customizable solution with good documentation, Forest Admin or a combination of Mongoose with a frontend framework might be worth considering.
