*Note: this repository consists of the outputs of large language models (LLMs). In many cases, these are unedited or minimally edited. The information provided is for demonstrative purposes only and is intended to highlight constraints and capabilities in LLM applications and prompt engineering strategies.*


# Prompt

I'd like you to provide a single list of recommended frameworks.

At the start please summarise the project and the current stack requirements (MongoDB + Mongoose). Remember that the focus is on quickly building an admin / CRUD app for managing the data. 

Then provide an ordered list of your recommendations for the best frameworks, from the best fit to the least bet. Provide 5 options. State why you recommend your number one recommendation.

# Output

Project Summary:
Output Hub is a web-based application for managing and organizing LLM (Large Language Model) prompts, outputs, and custom agents. The project requires a solution for quickly building an admin/CRUD interface to manage data stored in MongoDB, using Mongoose as the ODM (Object Document Mapper).

Current Stack Requirements:
- Database: MongoDB
- ODM: Mongoose

Recommended Frameworks (ordered from best fit to least):

1. AdminJS
   Reason: AdminJS is specifically designed to work seamlessly with Node.js and MongoDB/Mongoose. It offers out-of-the-box CRUD operations, a customizable UI, and easy integration with existing Express.js applications. Its auto-generated admin panel based on your Mongoose models makes it the fastest way to get a functional admin interface up and running for your Output Hub project.

2. React Admin
   A powerful and flexible admin framework for React that works well with MongoDB and custom Mongoose backends.

3. Keystone.js
   A Node.js-based CMS and web application framework with native support for MongoDB and Mongoose, offering an auto-generated Admin UI.

4. Strapi
   A headless CMS that supports MongoDB and provides a customizable admin panel, though it may require more setup for custom data structures.

5. Blitz.js
   A full-stack React framework that works with MongoDB and Mongoose, offering scaffolding for CRUD operations but may be more opinionated in its approach.

AdminJS is recommended as the top choice due to its perfect alignment with your current stack and its ability to rapidly generate an admin interface based on your Mongoose models, which is ideal for quickly building a CRUD app for managing your Output Hub data.
