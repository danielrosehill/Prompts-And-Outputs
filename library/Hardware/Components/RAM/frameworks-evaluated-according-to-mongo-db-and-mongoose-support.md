Based on the search results and the context of your previous questions, I can provide information about MongoDB and Mongoose support for the frameworks we discussed:

1. React Admin
- Supports MongoDB through custom data providers
- Has community-contributed data providers for MongoDB, including one using Mongoose [6]

2. Refine
- Supports MongoDB through custom data providers
- Has examples and tutorials for using MongoDB with Refine

3. Meteor
- Has built-in MongoDB support
- Can use Mongoose, but it's not the default ORM [1]

4. Sails.js
- Supports MongoDB via the sails-mongo adapter
- Can be used with Mongoose, though it's not the default ORM [1]

5. Adonis.js
- Supports MongoDB through third-party packages
- Can be used with Mongoose, but it's not built-in [5]

6. Nest.js
- Has built-in support for MongoDB via @nestjs/mongoose
- Uses Mongoose as the default MongoDB ORM [2]

7. Loopback.js
- Supports MongoDB out of the box
- Can be used with Mongoose, but has its own ORM [7]

8. Feathers
- Supports MongoDB out of the box
- Can be used with Mongoose through the feathers-mongoose adapter

9. Redwood.js
- Primarily designed for SQL databases
- MongoDB support is possible but not native

10. Blitz.js
- Built on Next.js and Prisma, which primarily support SQL databases
- MongoDB support is possible but not native

In summary, most of these frameworks support MongoDB, either natively or through adapters. Mongoose support is available for many of them, either as the default ORM or through additional packages. The frameworks with the strongest built-in support for MongoDB and Mongoose are likely Meteor, Nest.js, and Loopback.js.
