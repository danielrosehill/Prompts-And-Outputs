*Note: this repository consists of the outputs of large language models (LLMs). In many cases, these are unedited or minimally edited. The information provided is for demonstrative purposes only and is intended to highlight constraints and capabilities in LLM applications and prompt engineering strategies.*


# Prompt

Excellent. Let's indeed plan to use an ODM. So the picture is beginning to come together. I want to build a CRUD app that's going to be for my own personal use. It's for the purpose of storing and organising LLM outputs. Let's return to the question of development frameworks. With this updated context, can you recommend any frameworks that might be particularly suitable for building this with minimal effort? In the world of relational databases there are some admin panel builders. are there comparable systems tailored for developing with Mongo?

# Output

Given your updated context of building a personal CRUD app for organizing LLM outputs using MongoDB, there are indeed some frameworks and tools that can help you develop this with minimal effort. Here are some recommendations:

1. AdminBro (now called AdminJS):
   AdminJS is an auto-generated admin panel for Node.js apps. It works well with MongoDB and can significantly reduce the development time for CRUD operations.
   - Pros: Automatic CRUD interface, customizable, works with various ORMs including Mongoose
   - Cons: May require some coding for complex customizations

2. Strapi:
   While primarily a headless CMS, Strapi can be used as a quick way to build a MongoDB-backed admin panel.
   - Pros: Easy to set up, provides a nice UI out of the box, extensible
   - Cons: Might be overkill if you only need basic CRUD operations

3. KeystoneJS:
   A powerful Node.js-based CMS and web application framework that works well with MongoDB.
   - Pros: Flexible, scalable, provides both an admin UI and API
   - Cons: Steeper learning curve compared to some alternatives

4. Feathers:
   A lightweight web-framework for creating real-time applications and REST APIs. It has good MongoDB support.
   - Pros: Real-time capabilities, modular, easy to extend
   - Cons: Might require more setup for admin panel functionality

5. ILLA Cloud:
   As mentioned in your search results, ILLA Cloud is a low-code platform that can connect to MongoDB and provide a quick way to build internal tools.
   - Pros: Low-code, customizable, can connect to various databases including MongoDB
   - Cons: Might have limitations for very specific or complex requirements

6. Appsmith:
   Also mentioned in your search results, Appsmith is an open-source framework for building admin panels and internal tools.
   - Pros: Drag-and-drop interface, can connect to MongoDB, customizable with JavaScript
   - Cons: Might require some learning to fully utilize its capabilities

For your specific use case of organizing LLM outputs, I would recommend considering AdminJS or Appsmith. Both of these options provide a good balance of ease of use and customization capabilities, which would be beneficial for managing and organizing LLM outputs.

AdminJS would be particularly suitable if you want to quickly set up a CRUD interface with minimal coding, while still having the flexibility to add custom features for managing your LLM outputs.

Appsmith could be a good choice if you want more control over the UI and are comfortable with some JavaScript customization. It would allow you to create a more tailored interface for interacting with your LLM outputs.

Both of these options work well with MongoDB and can be set up relatively quickly, allowing you to focus more on organizing and utilizing your LLM outputs rather than spending too much time on development.
