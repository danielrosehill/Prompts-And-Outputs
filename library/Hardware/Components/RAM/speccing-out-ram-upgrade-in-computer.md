# Prompt

You told me yesterday that the max RAM for my current computer is 128GB. But there are 4 RAM slots. So I'm guessing the most logical way to achieve that would be 4 equal RAM slots. I believe I currently have 16GB x 2. I'm not great at maths. To upgrade to utilise my full capacity, what size of RAM would I need to buy? And if I wanted to "rip and replace" how much would it cost and how much money would I be wasting on pulling out perfectly good RAM (I don't think I'd find a buyer)? Give me some costs!

# Output

Based on the **system specifications** from the document you provided【61†source】, your computer currently has **32GB of RAM** (2 x 16GB DDR5 sticks), and your motherboard has **4 RAM slots**. The maximum supported RAM for your setup is **128GB**, which means you have **96GB of upgrade headroom**.

### Steps to Upgrade to 128GB:

#### 1. **Current Setup**:
- You currently have **2 x 16GB RAM sticks** installed, using **two of the four available slots**.
- You can either **replace** the existing RAM or **add** more sticks to the two unused slots.

#### 2. **To Fully Utilize 128GB**:
To maximize the RAM, you need **4 equal-sized RAM sticks**. Since your motherboard supports 128GB total, and you have **4 slots**, each slot should be **32GB**.

- **Option 1** (Best Option): Replace your current **2 x 16GB sticks** with **4 x 32GB sticks** to achieve 128GB.
- **Option 2**: Add **2 x 32GB sticks** to the two empty slots, resulting in **96GB total** (keeping the existing **2 x 16GB** sticks). This is a compromise solution but still gives you a significant upgrade.

### Costs of "Rip and Replace":

1. **Cost of 32GB DDR5 RAM Sticks**:
   - **32GB DDR5 (4800 MHz)** RAM sticks currently range between **$100 - $150** each, depending on the brand and speed.
   - For **4 x 32GB sticks** (to replace your current RAM and reach 128GB):
     - **$400 - $600** total.
   
2. **Cost of Pulling Out Perfectly Good RAM**:
   - Your existing **2 x 16GB DDR5 (4800 MHz)** RAM is still valuable, but as you mentioned, finding a buyer may be difficult.
   - **Estimated lost value**: If sold, you might get around **$50 - $80** for each 16GB stick, but this depends on demand.
   - If you can’t find a buyer, that’s around **$200 - $300** of RAM you’re pulling out and potentially wasting.

### Summary of Costs:

- **Upgrade to 128GB (4 x 32GB sticks)**: **$400 - $600**.
- **Estimated loss from unused RAM**: **$200 - $300** if you can’t find a buyer.

So, the total cost for the full upgrade could be between **$400 - $600**, plus the potential loss of **$200 - $300** if the old RAM isn’t sold.

Let me know if you'd like recommendations on specific RAM brands or where to find deals!
