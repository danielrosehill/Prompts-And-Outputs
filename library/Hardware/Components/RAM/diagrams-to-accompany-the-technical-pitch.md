# Prompt

Great work. Could you think of a few mermaid diagrams that might accompany that text? Remember that this would be pitched to a business audience. But they still might want to see some details about the technical architecture

# Output

Certainly! I'd be happy to suggest a few Mermaid diagrams that could accompany your pitch to a business audience while still providing some technical insights. Here are three diagrams that could be useful:

1. High-Level System Architecture:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User] -->|Interacts with| B[Web Interface]
    B -->|Sends requests to| C[Output Hub Backend]
    C -->|Stores/Retrieves data| D[(MongoDB Database)]
    C -->|Executes prompts| E[LLM APIs]
    C -->|Backs up data| F[Cloud Storage]
    subgraph Output Hub System
    B
    C
    D
    end
```

This diagram shows the overall system architecture, illustrating how users interact with the system and how Output Hub connects to external services.

2. Data Flow for Prompt Execution:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant UI as Web Interface
    participant Backend
    participant DB as MongoDB
    participant LLM as LLM API

    User->>UI: Create/Select Prompt
    UI->>Backend: Send Prompt
    Backend->>DB: Retrieve Agent Config
    Backend->>LLM: Execute Prompt
    LLM-->>Backend: Return Output
    Backend->>DB: Store Output
    Backend-->>UI: Display Result
    UI-->>User: Show Output
```

This sequence diagram illustrates the process of executing a prompt, from user input to storing the result.

3. Output Hub Core Components:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Output Hub] --> B[Prompt Management]
    A --> C[Output Storage]
    A --> D[Agent Configuration]
    A --> E[LLM Integration]
    A --> F[User Management]
    A --> G[Analytics Dashboard]

    B --> H[Version Control]
    C --> I[Tagging System]
    D --> J[API Key Management]
    E --> K[Multi-LLM Support]
    F --> L[Role-Based Access]
    G --> M[Performance Metrics]
```

This diagram breaks down the core components of Output Hub, showing the main features and their sub-components.

These diagrams provide a visual representation of Output Hub's architecture and functionality, balancing technical detail with business-oriented clarity. They can help potential investors understand the system's structure and capabilities without delving too deeply into technical specifics.
