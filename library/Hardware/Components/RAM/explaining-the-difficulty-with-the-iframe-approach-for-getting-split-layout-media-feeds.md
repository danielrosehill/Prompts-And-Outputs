# Prompt

Any self hosted projects for doing just this? the issue with the iframe approach is cross site scripting restrictions make it difficult. But I would have thought that creating quad layouts is a reasonably common requirement in certain industries so I'm surprised there aren't more tools or industry standards ones

# Output

You're absolutely right—cross-origin restrictions (CORS) make the **iframe** approach difficult with modern websites, especially for those that restrict embedding. Despite the common use case of needing to view multiple URLs simultaneously in grid layouts, the number of readily available, industry-standard tools or self-hosted solutions is surprisingly limited.

That said, there **are** self-hosted projects and more robust tools that can achieve this functionality, bypassing some of the iframe restrictions. These can be ideal for a **controlled environment** where multiple URLs can be displayed in a grid layout for purposes like monitoring, trading, or operational dashboards. Here are some self-hosted options and approaches you could consider:

### 1. **SaaS Dashboard Builders (Self-hosted versions available)**
Some **self-hosted dashboard frameworks** allow you to integrate websites, monitoring tools, and external data in custom layouts. These might not explicitly advertise "quad layouts for URLs," but you can configure them to show external websites as part of the dashboard.

#### a) **Smashing (formerly Dashing)**
   - **Description**: Smashing is a popular open-source dashboard framework that can display widgets, charts, and potentially websites, depending on configuration. You could configure it to create tiles that display the websites you need to monitor.
   - **How it works**: Although it's not built specifically for embedding websites, you can use custom widgets to display websites or external feeds. If embedding is blocked, Smashing supports APIs, and you can display specific data or snapshots from websites instead.
   - **Project page**: [Smashing on GitHub](https://github.com/Smashing/smashing)
   - **Why it’s useful**: Good for creating custom dashboards where you can include websites, data feeds, and more.

#### b) **Grafana (Custom Dashboard with Website Panels)**
   - **Description**: **Grafana** is primarily used for monitoring, but it has plugins that let you embed web content into your dashboard. Grafana has powerful dashboarding capabilities and can be extended to support custom layouts.
   - **How it works**: You can install Grafana locally and configure it to display multiple URLs in a grid-like fashion. Using the **HTML** or **iframe** plugin, you can create panels for each URL. However, you'd need to ensure these sites allow embedding or explore plugins to bypass restrictions.
   - **Project page**: [Grafana](https://grafana.com/)
   - **Why it’s useful**: Highly customizable, excellent for monitoring and combining external data feeds with web content.

### 2. **Self-Hosted Browser-based Projects for Multi-view Layouts**

#### a) **Browserless (Headless Chrome for Automation and Layouts)**
   - **Description**: **Browserless** is a self-hosted, headless Chrome service that allows you to automate browsing sessions. You could configure it to display multiple browser windows in a controlled environment (e.g., capturing content from multiple URLs in real-time).
   - **How it works**: You can set up **Browserless** to automate and render multiple browser sessions into one view (like a 2x2 grid), bypassing iframe issues. You’ll essentially run multiple browser instances in parallel and display them in a web-based dashboard.
   - **Project page**: [Browserless](https://www.browserless.io/)
   - **Why it’s useful**: This is one of the most flexible tools for embedding and displaying web pages in custom layouts, and it can handle even websites that block iframes.

#### b) **WallPanel (for Display Dashboards)**
   - **Description**: **WallPanel** is a browser-based dashboard that allows you to create custom grids and display multiple sources, including URLs. It's commonly used for things like home automation dashboards but can be adapted for other purposes.
   - **How it works**: You can set up a grid of websites and feeds in one interface, potentially using iframes or rendering web views directly through the system.
   - **Project page**: [WallPanel GitHub](https://github.com/WallPanel-Project/wallpanel-android) (while originally for Android, there are desktop implementations too).
   - **Why it’s useful**: Suitable for simple, customizable layouts for URL viewing.

### 3. **Custom Solutions (Headless Browsers + WebSocket)**
You could build a more **custom solution** using headless browsers (e.g., **Puppeteer** with headless Chromium) that captures and renders the content from the URLs you want to display. This approach avoids iframe restrictions because you're directly capturing and rendering web content.

#### a) **Puppeteer with Chromium (Custom-built Dashboard)**
   - **Description**: Puppeteer is a node library that provides a high-level API to control Chrome or Chromium. You can use Puppeteer to create a dashboard that renders multiple websites as snapshots or live web content, effectively bypassing iframe restrictions.
   - **How it works**: Use Puppeteer to open multiple Chromium instances and render the output in a **custom grid layout**. It captures the content from the websites and renders it into a unified view.
   - **Project page**: [Puppeteer GitHub](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer)
   - **Why it’s useful**: Fully bypasses iframe issues by directly rendering web content, highly customizable but requires some technical setup.

### 4. **Dedicated Industry Solutions**
Some industries, particularly in **financial trading**, use dedicated tools for multi-window layouts, but these are often proprietary or specific to certain sectors. In some cases, you can adapt **real-time monitoring software** to display multiple web-based dashboards in one layout.

#### a) **TradingView Custom Layouts (For Financial Monitoring)**
   - **Description**: While this is a more niche solution, **TradingView** and similar tools allow multiple charting and external feeds, including web views, to be tiled in one interface. This could potentially be adapted to display websites if you’re in a relevant field.
   - **Search for**: "Custom multi-screen tools for financial trading" or "Quad-screen layouts for financial monitoring."

### 5. **Advanced Custom Web App (Vue.js or React.js)**
If you're familiar with web development or have access to developers, you can build a **custom web app** using frameworks like **Vue.js** or **React.js**. These frameworks allow full control over layout and content rendering, enabling you to design an application that opens multiple URLs in a grid layout and handles cross-origin issues gracefully.

- **Approach**: Build a front-end application that opens the URLs as webviews (using proxies, if necessary) and presents them in a grid. This can be self-hosted and is browser-independent.
