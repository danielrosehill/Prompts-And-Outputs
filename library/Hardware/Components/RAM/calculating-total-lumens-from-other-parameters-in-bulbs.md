# Prompt

So in that spec I showed you earlier, what's the actual lumens provided: Power: 15W (Wattage =RGB+White+warm white) Voltage: AC 85V-265V Lumen: 100 LM/W

# Output

Based on the information provided for your bulb:

- **Power**: **15W** 
- **Lumen Efficiency**: **100 lumens per watt (LM/W)**

To calculate the **total lumens**:

\[
\text{Total Lumens} = \text{Wattage} \times \text{Lumens per Watt}
\]

\[
\text{Total Lumens} = 15W \times 100 \, \text{LM/W} = 1500 \, \text{Lumens}
\]

So, the bulb provides **1500 lumens**.

This means the bulb should offer decent brightness for **task lighting** or smaller spaces, but might not be enough for illuminating a larger room by itself, depending on your needs. For a workspace, it would be suitable for focused lighting (like a **desk lamp**) but may be insufficient for ambient overhead lighting of a larger area.
