*Note: this repository consists of the outputs of large language models (LLMs). In many cases, these are unedited or minimally edited. The information provided is for demonstrative purposes only and is intended to highlight constraints and capabilities in LLM applications and prompt engineering strategies.*


# Prompt

Although LLMs are a young field, could you share some thoughts on which benchmarking processes are considered to be the most rigorous and robust and to have the most credibility in the industry?

# Output

For periodic assessments of large language models (LLMs) across various parameters, you can follow these websites and publications that provide open-source results from standardized testing:

## Websites and Publications

1. **HELM (Holistic Evaluation of Language Models)**: This benchmark evaluates LLMs on a wide range of metrics, including accuracy, calibration, robustness, fairness, bias, toxicity, and efficiency. It provides a comprehensive assessment across various tasks.

2. **BIG-Bench**: A large-scale benchmark that evaluates LLMs on diverse tasks such as text generation, question answering, and commonsense reasoning. It includes unique tasks like social reasoning and logical reasoning.

3. **TrustLLM-Benchmark**: Focuses on the trustworthiness of LLMs by evaluating aspects like truthfulness, safety, fairness, robustness, privacy, machine ethics, transparency, and accountability.

4. **Vellum AI - LLM Leaderboard**: Offers comparisons of LLM capabilities with detailed performance metrics for leading models.

5. **MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding)**: Evaluates LLMs across a wide range of subjects to test their breadth and depth of knowledge.

## Key Benchmarks

- **GLUE and SuperGLUE**: Focus on natural language understanding tasks.
- **HumanEval**: Targets coding capabilities by evaluating code generation tasks.
- **CNN/DM and XSUM**: Used for assessing summarization capabilities.

These sources provide valuable insights into the performance of the biggest models on general tasks like text summarization, text generation, and accuracy. They are essential for keeping up with the latest developments in LLM performance.
