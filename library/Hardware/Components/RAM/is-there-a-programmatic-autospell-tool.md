# Prompt

I'd like to copy some of my existing outputs into into the public folder I'm setting up. But lots of them have typos. Are there any Python scripts that can be used to fix up a lot of cosmetic defects in text? Like missing capitals and typos? Kind of like an automatic autospell that I can apply in bulk to a few hundred files

# Output

Yes, you can use Python to create a script that automatically corrects **typos**, **missing capitalizations**, and other cosmetic defects across multiple files. There are several libraries that can help with this, such as **`spellchecker`**, **`textblob`**, and **`autocorrect`**.

Here’s a step-by-step approach to create a Python script that will:

1. **Check and correct typos.**
2. **Fix missing capitalizations** (e.g., the first letter of sentences).

### Libraries to Use:

- **`autocorrect`**: For basic spelling correction.
- **`nltk`**: Can help with sentence tokenization to correct capitalization.
- **`os`**: For handling multiple files in a directory.

You’ll want to install these libraries if you haven’t already:

```bash
pip install autocorrect nltk
```

### Sample Python Script

Here’s a Python script that can handle multiple files, check for typos, and ensure correct capitalization at the start of sentences:

```python
import os
from autocorrect import Speller
import nltk

# Download the NLTK punkt tokenizer for sentence splitting
nltk.download('punkt')
from nltk.tokenize import sent_tokenize

# Initialize the autocorrect Speller
spell = Speller(lang='en')

def fix_text(text):
    # Split the text into sentences
    sentences = sent_tokenize(text)
    
    # Correct spelling and fix capitalization
    corrected_sentences = []
    for sentence in sentences:
        # Correct typos in the sentence
        corrected_sentence = spell(sentence)
        # Ensure the first letter is capitalized
        corrected_sentence = corrected_sentence.capitalize()
        corrected_sentences.append(corrected_sentence)

    # Join the corrected sentences back together
    return ' '.join(corrected_sentences)

def process_file(file_path):
    # Read the file content
    with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
        content = f.read()

    # Fix typos and capitalization
    fixed_content = fix_text(content)

    # Write the corrected content back to the file
    with open(file_path, 'w') as f:
        f.write(fixed_content)

def process_folder(folder_path):
    # Iterate over all files in the folder
    for filename in os.listdir(folder_path):
        file_path = os.path.join(folder_path, filename)
        # Only process .txt or markdown files
        if os.path.isfile(file_path) and filename.endswith(('.txt', '.md')):
            print(f'Processing file: {filename}')
            process_file(file_path)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Set the folder where your files are stored
    folder_path = '/path/to/your/folder'  # Change this to your folder
    process_folder(folder_path)
```

### How the Script Works:

1. **Autocorrect for Typos**: It uses the `autocorrect.Speller` class to correct spelling mistakes in each sentence.
   
2. **Fixing Capitalization**: It uses **NLTK** to split the text into sentences. After correcting typos, it ensures that the first letter of each sentence is capitalized.

3. **Processing Multiple Files**: It goes through all `.txt` and `.md` files in the folder you specify, processes each file to fix text issues, and overwrites the original files with corrected content.

### Running the Script:

1. Change the `folder_path` to the directory where your text files are stored.
2. Run the script, and it will automatically process all `.txt` and `.md` files in the folder, correcting typos and capitalization errors.

### Additional Enhancements:

- **Custom Spell Check Dictionaries**: If you have domain-specific terms, you could customize the spell checker by adding specific words to the dictionary.
- **Backup Files**: Consider adding functionality to create backups of the original files before overwriting them, in case you need to review changes.
