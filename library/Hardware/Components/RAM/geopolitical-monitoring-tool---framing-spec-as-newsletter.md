# Prompt

Can you think of any platforms that could be used to create a twice daily automated newsletter (for private use) summarising key geopolitical developments in Israel. I could provide a list of news sources, but other than that, this would have to be a truly cohesive tool capable of organising the material into a brief style report and then sending to my inbox

# Output

To create a **twice-daily automated newsletter** summarizing key **geopolitical developments in Israel**, you'd need a tool that combines web content aggregation, automated summarization, and email distribution. Here are some platforms and approaches that might fit your needs:

### 1. **Zapier + RSS Aggregator + GPT Integration**
   - **Overview**: Using **Zapier** to link various services can help you create a workflow that automatically collects information, summarizes it, and emails it.
   - **Workflow**:
     1. Use an **RSS aggregator** like **Inoreader** or **Feedly** to gather news from a list of Israeli news sources (e.g., Haaretz, Times of Israel, Jerusalem Post).
     2. Set up **Zapier** to take the RSS feed and send the content to **OpenAI’s GPT API** for summarization.
     3. Zapier can then take the summarized report and email it to your inbox twice daily.
   - **Pros**: Customizable and allows control over sources and email schedule.
   - **Cons**: Requires some setup, and you'd need to pay for both Zapier and OpenAI API if using GPT-4.

### 2. **IFTTT + Hugging Face Transformers**
   - **Overview**: **IFTTT** (If This Then That) could be used to aggregate content from various sources and trigger a summarization workflow.
   - **Workflow**:
     1. Use **IFTTT** to collect news articles via RSS feeds and integrate them with a cloud-based service that has Hugging Face models deployed.
     2. Summarize the articles using a language model (such as **BART** or **T5** from Hugging Face).
     3. Use IFTTT to automate the email sending of summaries to your inbox.
   - **Pros**: Hugging Face models can be hosted locally or on the cloud, offering more control over data.
   - **Cons**: Requires some programming knowledge to set up the Hugging Face model integration.

### 3. **Inoreader + Mailchimp Integration**
   - **Overview**: **Inoreader** is an advanced RSS reader that can curate content, tag it, and export it to other services, such as **Mailchimp** for email distribution.
   - **Workflow**:
     1. Set up **RSS feeds** in Inoreader to collect articles from relevant news sources.
     2. Use **rules in Inoreader** to filter articles based on keywords like "geopolitics," "Israel," etc.
     3. Connect **Inoreader with Mailchimp** via their integration (or Zapier) to send automated email digests twice daily.
   - **Pros**: Inoreader’s rules make it easy to curate content, and Mailchimp offers robust email tools.
   - **Cons**: Requires a paid plan for advanced integrations and Mailchimp subscription.

### 4. **Merlin (Open Source Project)**
   - **Overview**: **Merlin** is an open-source project designed to collect, summarize, and distribute content. It allows you to use news sources and automatically summarize and distribute newsletters.
   - **Workflow**:
     1. Deploy **Merlin** on your server (or VPS).
     2. Feed it your list of news sources via RSS.
     3. Merlin will use a built-in summarization engine to generate a digest of key geopolitical events, which can be customized.
     4. You can configure email delivery directly to your inbox.
   - **Pros**: Fully customizable and privacy-focused since you can self-host it.
   - **Cons**: Requires some server and technical setup knowledge.

### 5. **Curated.co + GPT-4**
   - **Overview**: **Curated.co** is a platform that makes newsletter creation easy by integrating content curation, summarization, and distribution.
   - **Workflow**:
     1. Collect links and content manually or through **Zapier** using an RSS feed or Google Alerts.
     2. Integrate the content collection workflow with **GPT-4** to automatically summarize it.
     3. Use Curated.co to arrange the summaries into a newsletter format and send it automatically twice a day.
   - **Pros**: Streamlined for newsletter creation; integrates easily with APIs.
   - **Cons**: Costly if you need frequent and automatic updates, as Curated.co’s automation capabilities are limited without third-party integrations.

### 6. **Obsidian + Daily Notes Plugin + Custom Script**
   - **Overview**: Using **Obsidian**, you can automate news aggregation, summarization, and report generation.
   - **Workflow**:
     1. Use a script (Python or Bash) to collect articles via RSS feeds twice daily.
     2. Summarize the content with an LLM (such as GPT-4 API).
     3. Use the **Daily Notes plugin** to create a new page with a summary of the geopolitical news.
     4. Integrate with a mail client or use a script to email the daily notes page twice daily.

     2. Integrate Mailbrew with **OpenAI API** via Zapier or similar tools to add an automated summarization step.
     3. Configure Mailbrew to send out the digests twice daily.
   - **Pros**: Easy to use with very minimal setup, and the interface is clean and simple.
