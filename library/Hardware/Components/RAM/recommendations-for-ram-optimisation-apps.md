To monitor RAM consumption and optimize performance on your Android device, here are a few apps that can help:

1. SD Maid
SD Maid helps clean up your device by removing unnecessary files, cache, and residual data from uninstalled apps. It also includes a feature for monitoring and managing RAM usage.

2. Activity Monitor (System Monitor)
This app provides a real-time display of your system's CPU and memory usage, battery stats, and network info. Itâ€™s good for identifying which apps are using the most RAM and resources.

3. 3C Toolbox
A powerful app that offers system monitoring, task management, and optimization features. You can monitor RAM usage, CPU usage, and optimize the device for better performance.

4. Greenify
Greenify helps reduce the amount of memory consumed by background apps. It hibernates apps that you don't actively use, freeing up system resources, including RAM.


5. Device Care (Built-in Samsung Tool)
Samsung devices have a built-in "Device Care" feature under Settings > Battery and Device Care. It includes options for optimizing performance, managing background apps, and checking system resources like RAM usage.

Would you prefer an app that emphasizes cleaning/optimization or one for detailed real-time monitoring?
