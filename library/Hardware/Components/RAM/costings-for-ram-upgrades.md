# Prompt

Great. So we've identified the two upgrade "paths" if you will. Could you give me an approximate costing for both please? The first one was just upgrading capacity. The second was maxxing out by putting in exclusively new RAM

# Output

Here’s an approximate costing for both upgrade paths, based on current market trends for DDR5 RAM. I’ll provide you with estimated costs for **upgrading your capacity** (by adding RAM) and **maxing out** (by replacing everything with new RAM). Prices may vary slightly depending on the region, so consider these ballpark estimates.

### **Upgrade Path 1: Adding to Your Current RAM (to reach 64GB)**
Since you currently have **32GB (2 x 16GB) DDR5 4800MHz** RAM, you would only need to buy an additional **32GB (2 x 16GB)** of matching RAM.

- **Required Purchase**: 32GB DDR5 4800MHz (2 x 16GB)
   - Approximate cost for **32GB (2 x 16GB)** DDR5 4800MHz RAM: **$100 to $150** (depending on the brand and market fluctuations).
   - Matching your current Kingston RAM (Kingston KVR48U40BS8-16) would likely fall into this range.

#### **Total Estimated Cost for Path 1 (upgrading to 64GB)**:
- **$100 to $150**

### **Upgrade Path 2: Maxing Out (128GB by replacing everything)**
To max out your system’s memory capacity to **128GB**, you would need to buy **4 x 32GB DDR5 4800MHz RAM** sticks and replace the existing RAM.

- **Required Purchase**: 128GB DDR5 4800MHz (4 x 32GB)
   - Approximate cost for **32GB (1 x 32GB)** DDR5 4800MHz: **$110 to $160** per stick, so for 4 sticks, the total would be:
     - **$440 to $640** (for 128GB total, 4 x 32GB).

#### **Total Estimated Cost for Path 2 (maxing out to 128GB)**:
- **$440 to $640**

---

### **Summary**:
1. **Upgrade Path 1 (adding 32GB to get 64GB)**: **$100 to $150**
2. **Upgrade Path 2 (replacing everything to reach 128GB)**: **$440 to $640**

These estimates are based on typical market pricing for DDR5 RAM in the 4800MHz range. Brands like **Kingston, Corsair, G.Skill,** and **Crucial** often fall into these ranges, with Kingston typically being a mid-range option price-wise.
