For a 40 cm square print with a frame, you should typically print the image a bit smaller to allow for the matting (the border between the image and the frame) and the frame itself. A common practice is to print the image about 2-4 cm smaller on each side, meaning the image would be approximately 36 cm square. This leaves space for a 2 cm mat or margin on each side. However, the exact size may vary depending on the frame and matting style you choose.

If your frame doesnâ€™t include a mat, you can print closer to 40 cm but leave a slight margin for adjustment when framing (about 0.5-1 cm on each side). Be sure to check the specific frame dimensions to ensure a perfect fit!
