# Prompt

Here's the list of URLs I'm building in VS Code. Is there any extension to order by source name to make it easier to work with:

# Output

Yes, there is an extension in Visual Studio Code called **"Sort Lines"** that can help you sort your list alphabetically by the first parameter (source name). You can install it from the VS Code Extensions Marketplace. Once installed, you can highlight the text you want to sort, press `Ctrl+Shift+P`, and type **"Sort Lines Ascending"** or **"Sort Lines Descending"** to sort it as needed.

This should help you easily order your sources alphabetically.
