# Prompt

I use fedora linux + kde plasma. there are a few programs that I'm accessing all the time mostly for reference. I would love to be able to combine them into one launched application which lays them out next to one another in a grid. Are there any programs that are designed to do this?

# Output

While there isn't a built-in feature in KDE Plasma to combine multiple applications into a single launched grid layout, there are a few approaches you can consider to achieve a similar result:

## KWin Tiling

KDE Plasma 5.27 and later versions introduced enhanced tiling capabilities in KWin, the window manager[1]. This feature allows you to create custom tiling layouts:

1. Press Meta+T to enter the tiling editor mode.
2. Create a grid layout for your frequently used applications.
3. Use Shift+drag to place windows into the tiles.

This method allows you to quickly arrange your applications in a grid-like layout, though you'll need to launch the applications individually.

## Custom Launcher Script

You could create a custom launcher script that opens multiple applications and arranges them in a grid-like layout:

1. Write a shell script that launches your desired applications.
2. Use `wmctrl` or `qdbus` commands to position the windows.
3. Create a .desktop file to launch this script from your application menu.

This approach requires some scripting knowledge but offers a high degree of customization.

## Application Grouping

KDE Plasma allows you to group applications, which can help organize your frequently used programs:

1. Right-click on an application's title bar.
2. Select "More Actions" > "Special Application Settings".
3. In the "Arrangement & Access" tab, enable "Force" for "Group".
4. Assign the same group ID to all applications you want to group.

This method doesn't create a grid layout but keeps your applications together for easy access[1].

## Third-Party Solutions

While not specifically designed for KDE, you might consider third-party application launchers that offer grid layouts. For example, Rocket is an application launcher for KDE Plasma that sorts applications in a horizontal or vertical grid[5].

Remember, the effectiveness of these solutions may vary depending on your specific needs and the version of KDE Plasma you're using. Experimenting with different approaches will help you find the best solution for your workflow.
