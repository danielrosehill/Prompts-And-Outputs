### Guide to Correct Parameters for Local Connections in Docker Environment

When running applications like **FreshRSS** with **Docker Compose**, you need to configure services to communicate with each other properly. This is typically done using **service names** rather than `localhost`, as each service in Docker Compose runs in its own isolated container.

Here are the correct parameters and best practices for managing connections **within Docker** containers:

---

### 1. **Service Name as Host (Instead of `localhost`)**

In a Docker Compose environment, services can communicate with each other using their **service names**. When containers are defined in a `docker-compose.yml` file, they are automatically placed on the same Docker network and can resolve each other by the service name.

#### Example:
If you have a service named `freshrss-db` for your PostgreSQL database, instead of using `localhost`, you should use `freshrss-db` as the **DB_HOST** in the FreshRSS container's environment configuration.

#### How It Works:
- Docker automatically creates an internal network for all containers defined in the same Compose file.
- Each service is given a hostname equivalent to its service name (defined under the `services:` section).

**Example `docker-compose.yml` snippet**:

```yaml
services:
  freshrss:
    image: freshrss/freshrss:latest
    environment:
      DB_HOST: freshrss-db  # Use the service name as the host
      DB_PORT: 5432          # PostgreSQL default port
      DB_USER: freshrss
      DB_PASSWORD: freshrss
      DB_BASE: freshrss

  freshrss-db:
    image: postgres:17
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: freshrss
      POSTGRES_USER: freshrss
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: freshrss
```

### 2. **Using Ports**

You need to expose the correct ports for services that interact with each other. For example, PostgreSQL typically runs on port `5432`, and you need to ensure this port is exposed both internally and, optionally, externally if you need to access the database from outside the Docker network.

In the case of Docker Compose, the service-to-service communication happens on the **internal Docker network**, so only the container’s internal port matters for local communication. For example, FreshRSS needs to connect to PostgreSQL via the **internal port** (e.g., `5432`), but it doesn't require the port to be exposed to the host system unless you want external access.

#### Example:

```yaml
services:
  freshrss-db:
    image: postgres:17
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"  # Expose the port for external access, optional
```

Here, FreshRSS would connect to PostgreSQL on the internal Docker network on port `5432` using the service name `freshrss-db`.

### 3. **Database Connection Parameters**

When configuring your application (e.g., FreshRSS) to connect to a database running in Docker, the typical parameters you need are:

- **DB_HOST**: The service name of the database container (e.g., `freshrss-db`).
- **DB_PORT**: The internal port of the database service (e.g., `5432` for PostgreSQL).
- **DB_USER**: The database user (e.g., `freshrss`).
- **DB_PASSWORD**: The database password (e.g., `freshrss`).
- **DB_NAME (DB_BASE)**: The name of the database (e.g., `freshrss`).

**Sample configuration in FreshRSS**:

```yaml
DB_HOST: freshrss-db
DB_PORT: 5432
DB_USER: freshrss
DB_PASSWORD: freshrss
DB_BASE: freshrss
```

### 4. **Networking in Docker Compose**

By default, Docker Compose creates a **bridge network** that allows services in the same `docker-compose.yml` file to communicate with each other. There is no need for manual configuration unless you are dealing with external networks or custom setups.

#### Example:
You can define the network explicitly if needed, but it’s optional:

```yaml
networks:
  freshrss_network:
    driver: bridge

services:
  freshrss:
    image: freshrss/freshrss:latest
    networks:
      - freshrss_network
    environment:
      DB_HOST: freshrss-db

  freshrss-db:
    image: postgres:17
    networks:
      - freshrss_network
```

By using a custom network, the services will still be able to communicate using their service names (`freshrss` and `freshrss-db` in this case).

### 5. **Accessing Services from Outside the Docker Network**
If you need to access one of your services (like the PostgreSQL database) from your local machine (outside of Docker), you need to expose the ports on the host machine. For instance, exposing PostgreSQL on the host machine’s `5432` port:

```yaml
services:
  freshrss-db:
    image: postgres:17
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"  # Maps the host's port 5432 to the container's port 5432
```

You can then connect to the PostgreSQL service using `localhost` on port `5432` from outside Docker (e.g., using a database client on your local machine).

### Conclusion

For **local connections in Docker**, always use the **service name** as the host, not `localhost`. This allows containers to communicate on the internal Docker network. Key parameters like **DB_HOST**, **DB_PORT**, and **DB_USER** should be correctly configured to ensure seamless service-to-service interaction within the Docker environment.
