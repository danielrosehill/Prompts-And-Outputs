# Prompt

Which full stack web app development frameworks have the best integration with MongoDB and might be the most suitable for buildling my admin interface for a MongoDB database?

# Output

Based on your requirements and the search results, here are some full-stack web app development frameworks that have excellent MongoDB integration and could be suitable for building your admin interface:

1. MEAN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js)
The MEAN stack is specifically designed to work with MongoDB and provides seamless integration. It's a JavaScript-based framework that's well-suited for building scalable web applications, including admin interfaces[6].

2. Meteor
Meteor is an excellent choice for building real-time applications quickly with minimal synchronization code. It has built-in MongoDB support and offers real-time data propagation[4].

3. Nest.js
Nest.js offers built-in support for MongoDB via @nestjs/mongoose. It uses Mongoose as the default MongoDB ORM and provides a modular architecture with TypeScript support, making it ideal for building scalable and maintainable server-side applications[7][4].

4. Sails.js
Sails.js supports MongoDB via the sails-mongo adapter. It provides an easy setup process and allows you to use Waterline model methods to interact with your MongoDB models[5].

5. Loopback
Loopback is highly-extensible and enables you to create dynamic end-to-end REST APIs with little coding. It connects to multiple data sources, including MongoDB, and is ideal for creating dynamic REST APIs with minimal coding effort[4].

6. Adonis.js
While not specifically designed for MongoDB, Adonis.js can be integrated with MongoDB through third-party packages. It offers a comprehensive feature set and stable ecosystem, which could be beneficial for building an admin interface[4].

7. Feathers
Feathers is a microservice-oriented framework that works seamlessly with Express for building real-time applications and REST APIs. It supports MongoDB out of the box[4].

These frameworks offer different levels of complexity and features. The MEAN stack, Meteor, and Nest.js might be particularly well-suited for your project due to their strong MongoDB integration and support for building complex applications like admin interfaces.

Remember to consider factors such as your team's expertise, the specific requirements of your admin interface, and the long-term maintainability of the project when making your final decision.
