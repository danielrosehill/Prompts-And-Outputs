*Note: this repository consists of the outputs of large language models (LLMs). In many cases, these are unedited or minimally edited. The information provided is for demonstrative purposes only and is intended to highlight constraints and capabilities in LLM applications and prompt engineering strategies.*


# Prompt

I am building a library of prompts to use for evaluating LLMs so that I can identify which will be the most helpful for the specific use-cases I'm targeting. To begin, I'm developing a repository of evaluation prompts: prompts specifically written to compare the capabilities of different LLMs. I would be interested in knowing about the existing frameworks that I can use for this purpose: both SaaS tools built for this and frameworks that I can self-host. I am aiming to streamline the process of selecting the perfect model for a specific recurrent job.

# Output

To help streamline the process of evaluating and comparing LLMs for specific use-cases, here are some **existing frameworks** and **SaaS tools** that can assist in building your repository of prompts for model assessment:

### SaaS Tools for Evaluating LLMs:
1. **OpenAI Playground**: Provides a flexible interface for testing prompts across different GPT models with adjustable parameters.
2. **Hugging Face Inference API**: Offers access to a variety of models through a unified interface, including comparison tools.
3. **Scale AI**: Features a comprehensive platform for LLM evaluations, allowing comparisons and fine-tuning for specific tasks.

### Self-Hosted Frameworks:
1. **EleutherAI's LM Evaluation Harness**: A framework for evaluating language models on multiple benchmarks with customization options.

### Considerations:
These tools can help automate the process of testing, gathering results, and refining prompts for your targeted tasks. Creating custom evaluation pipelines will make it easier to determine the best model for recurrent jobs.
