# Prompt

Thanks for spotting the CPU RAM mismatch. Is this likely to be causing performance issues?

# Output

Based on the specifications in the image and the information from the search results, there is indeed a mismatch between the CPU's officially supported RAM speed and the RAM installed in your system. However, this mismatch is unlikely to cause performance issues. Here's why:

1. Official Support vs. Actual Compatibility: While the Intel Core i7-12700F officially supports DDR5 up to 4800 MHz, it can actually work with higher speeds[3][4][6]. The official specification is often conservative.

2. XMP Profiles: Modern motherboards and CPUs can utilize XMP (Extreme Memory Profile) to run RAM at higher speeds than the official CPU specification[3][5].

3. Common Practice: It's quite common and generally safe to run RAM at speeds higher than the CPU's official support, especially with DDR5[3][4].

4. Your Specific Configuration: Your system has DDR5 4800MHz RAM, which is exactly at the official supported speed for the i7-12700F[6]. This means you're not even pushing beyond the official specs.

5. B760 Motherboard Compatibility: Your motherboard (PRO B760M-A WIFI) is designed to support DDR5 RAM and should handle the 4800MHz speed without issues.

While you're not likely to experience performance issues due to this RAM configuration, if you do encounter any stability problems, you can always try:

1. Updating your motherboard BIOS to the latest version.
2. Ensuring XMP is properly enabled in the BIOS.
3. If issues persist, you could try running the RAM at a slightly lower speed (e.g., 4600MHz) to see if it improves stability.

Overall, your current setup should work fine, and the RAM speed is appropriate for your CPU and motherboard combination.
