# Prompt

Great. Thanks. Let's just say that I did want to upgrade to 32GB at some point in the future. The best way to do that would be 4 x 32GB for the reasons that you've mentioned right?

# Output

Exactly! If you decide to upgrade to **128GB** in the future, the best way would be to use **4 x 32GB** modules for the following reasons:

1. **Matching Modules**: Using **four identical 32GB modules** ensures that all the memory sticks have the same specifications—**speed, timings, voltage, and capacity**. This significantly reduces the risk of compatibility issues and ensures the system operates smoothly.

2. **Dual-Channel Consistency**: Your motherboard can support **dual-channel memory**, and by using **4 x 32GB**, you maintain an ideal setup that maximizes the benefits of dual-channel performance, keeping everything balanced across all channels.

3. **Avoid Mixed Capacity Issues**: By upgrading to **4 x 32GB**, you eliminate the potential performance downsides of having mixed capacities, which can result in single-channel operation for certain parts of your memory or reduced bandwidth.

This approach would fully utilize your motherboard’s **128GB** capacity, maintaining peak performance without sacrificing compatibility or stability.

If you need any more information about the timing or brands for such an upgrade, feel free to ask!
