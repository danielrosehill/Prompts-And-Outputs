# Prompt

Great work. Let's focus on the first use-case as it's the most "pressing" project for me. Could you provide me with a guide for how I might go about doing this? And I presume that there's a significant difference between fine tuning an LLM and providing basic configuration parameters to things like "Custom GPTs"

# Output

Yes, there is a significant difference between **fine-tuning an LLM** and **providing basic configuration parameters** to models like "Custom GPTs." Fine-tuning involves training the model on specific data to adjust its parameters for better performance on particular tasks, while configuring Custom GPTs involves setting instructions, tone, and behavior without changing the model's underlying weights.

Here’s a **step-by-step guide** on how you can go about fine-tuning an LLM for **geopolitical news summarization**:

---

### **Step 1: Choose Your Base LLM**
Fine-tuning starts with selecting a base model that you want to adapt to your specific use case. For this, some suitable options include:

1. **OpenAI GPT-4** (via API, requires access to fine-tuning capabilities).
2. **Hugging Face Models** (many LLMs are available and open-source):
   - **BERT** for text classification and summarization.
   - **T5** (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) for summarization tasks.
   - **GPT-Neo** or **GPT-J** for generative tasks similar to GPT-3.
3. **LLaMA (Meta)**: Suitable for fine-tuning on various domains.

If you prefer **Hugging Face** models, you can easily download and fine-tune them.

---

### **Step 2: Collect and Prepare the Data**
To fine-tune a model, you need a well-structured dataset of geopolitical news. The dataset should include:

1. **Geopolitical News Articles**: You can collect this data using APIs like **NewsAPI**, **GDELT**, or scraping from sources (ensure compliance with their terms of service).
2. **Summaries of the Articles**: Manually generate or collect short, concise summaries of each news article to serve as your target output.

#### **Data Format**:
- For summarization, you will need **input-output pairs** where the input is the full news article, and the output is a concise summary.
  - Example Format:
    ```json
    {
      "input": "Full article text here...",
      "output": "Summary of the article here..."
    }
    ```

3. **Data Size**: For fine-tuning, the more examples, the better. Aim for at least **several thousand examples** to effectively train the model.

---

### **Step 3: Preprocess the Data**
Ensure that your data is clean and formatted correctly. Common steps include:

1. **Removing Noise**: Strip unnecessary content like ads, unrelated links, or irrelevant sections.
2. **Truncation**: If news articles are too long, consider truncating to a maximum token size that the model can handle (e.g., GPT-3.5/4 has a token limit).
3. **Tokenization**: Use the tokenization method specific to the base model you’ve selected (e.g., GPT-3 tokenizer for GPT models, BERT tokenizer for BERT-based models).

---

### **Step 4: Choose a Fine-Tuning Platform**
Fine-tuning can be done on several platforms depending on your model and infrastructure:

1. **OpenAI Fine-Tuning (for GPT-3/4)**
   - OpenAI allows fine-tuning on their GPT-3 models using their API.
   - Documentation: [OpenAI Fine-Tuning](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning)

2. **Hugging Face Transformers**
   - Hugging Face provides an easy interface for fine-tuning models using pre-trained weights.
   - You can fine-tune locally or via Hugging Face’s hosted solutions.
   - Documentation: [Hugging Face Fine-Tuning Guide](https://huggingface.co/transformers/training.html)

3. **Google Colab + Hugging Face**
   - You can use **Google Colab** for free GPU resources and fine-tune models using the Hugging Face library.
   - Use this for prototyping if you don’t have local GPU access.

---

### **Step 5: Fine-Tune the Model**
Here’s a basic example of fine-tuning a Hugging Face model for summarization:

1. **Install Required Libraries**:
   ```bash
   pip install transformers datasets
   ```

2. **Load the Pre-Trained Model** (e.g., T5 for summarization):
   ```python
   from transformers import T5Tokenizer, T5ForConditionalGeneration

   model = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained('t5-small')
   tokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained('t5-small')
   ```

3. **Prepare Your Dataset**:
   ```python
   from datasets import load_dataset

   dataset = load_dataset('json', data_files={'train': 'path_to_train.json', 'test': 'path_to_test.json'})
   ```

4. **Tokenize the Data**:
   ```python
   def preprocess_function(examples):
       inputs = [example['input'] for example in examples]
       model_inputs = tokenizer(inputs, max_length=512, truncation=True)

       # Tokenize the targets
       with tokenizer.as_target_tokenizer():
           labels = tokenizer([example['output'] for example in examples], max_length=150, truncation=True)

       model_inputs['labels'] = labels['input_ids']
       return model_inputs

   tokenized_dataset = dataset.map(preprocess_function, batched=True)
   ```

5. **Fine-Tune the Model**:
   ```python
   from transformers import Trainer, TrainingArguments

   training_args = TrainingArguments(
       output_dir="./results",
       evaluation_strategy="epoch",
       learning_rate=2e-5,
       per_device_train_batch_size=8,
       per_device_eval_batch_size=8,
       num_train_epochs=3,
       weight_decay=0.01,
   )

   trainer = Trainer(
       model=model,
       args=training_args,
       train_dataset=tokenized_dataset['train'],
       eval_dataset=tokenized_dataset['test'],
   )

   trainer.train()
   ```

6. **Evaluate the Model**:
   After fine-tuning, evaluate how well it generates concise summaries from unseen news articles.

---

### **Step 6: Test and Deploy the Model**
Once the model is fine-tuned, test it by inputting new geopolitical articles to generate summaries.

- **Deployment Options**:
   - **Hugging Face Inference API**: Hugging Face provides easy deployment options.
   - **Custom API**: Set up your own API endpoint for serving the model (e.g., using FastAPI).

---

### **Step 7: Continuous Fine-Tuning and Updates**
Geopolitical events evolve rapidly, so continuously fine-tune your model with newer datasets to keep it relevant.

1. **Set Up a News Feed**: Automate news intake using news APIs, and keep updating the fine-tuned model with the latest events.
2. **Monitor Performance**: Regularly assess the accuracy and relevance of the summaries to ensure that the model adapts to new data.

---

### **Fine-Tuning vs. Custom GPTs**
- **Fine-Tuning**: Involves changing the actual weights of the model using specific training data. This allows the model to become highly specialized for a task.
- **Custom GPTs**: Involves providing behavioral instructions and setting configurations like tone, but the underlying model is not altered. This is a quicker approach but lacks the depth of specialization achieved by fine-tuning.

Fine-tuning is more powerful but requires technical expertise and resources, while creating a Custom GPT is more user-friendly and accessible for rapid deployment.
