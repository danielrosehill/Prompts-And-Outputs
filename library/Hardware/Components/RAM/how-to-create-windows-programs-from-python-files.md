# Prompt

Please give me a list of the most popular applications for creating windows programs from python files?

# Output

Based on the search results and general knowledge in the field, here's a list of the most popular applications for creating Windows programs from Python files:

1. PyInstaller
   - One of the most widely used tools
   - Bundles a Python application and all its dependencies into a single package
   - Compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux
   - Can be used via command line or with GUI tools like Auto-py-to-exe[1][6]

2. Auto-py-to-exe
   - A graphical interface for PyInstaller
   - Provides a user-friendly way to create executables
   - Uses a web browser-based interface for configuration[5][6]

3. cx_Freeze
   - Another popular library for creating standalone executables
   - Supports Windows, macOS, and Linux
   - Requires creating a setup script[4]

4. py2exe
   - A long-standing tool for converting Python scripts to Windows executables
   - Specifically designed for Windows[5]

5. Nuitka
   - A Python compiler that can create standalone executables
   - Offers potential performance improvements over interpreted Python[2]

6. PyOxidizer
   - A relatively newer tool that produces a single file executable
   - Embeds Python interpreter and libraries into the executable[2]

7. Pyinstaller GUI
   - A third-party graphical interface for PyInstaller
   - Separate from Auto-py-to-exe[3]

8. WiX Toolset
   - While not Python-specific, it can be used to create MSI installers for Python applications
   - More complex but offers high customization[3]

These tools vary in ease of use, features, and the type of output they produce. PyInstaller and Auto-py-to-exe are often recommended for beginners due to their simplicity and wide community support. For more advanced needs or specific requirements, tools like cx_Freeze or WiX Toolset might be more appropriate.
