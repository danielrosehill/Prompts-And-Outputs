# Prompt

There are some things that I would like to provide the speccing app as contextual knowledge so that I don't need to specify them each time.

For instance:

- My desktop and laptop are Fedora
- My phone is Android
- I'd always like a desktop app although I'm fine with using a web UI
- I always care about backups and want to know how the provider allowers users to backup their data

Would it be possible to integrate this as background context into the app so that I could define the unique requirements for a particular tool without having to supply these every time?

# Output

Yes, it is definitely possible to integrate background context into the spec generation app so that you don't have to provide common details like your preferred platforms or backup requirements every time. You can build this into the app as **default settings** or **persistent context** that are automatically applied when generating a new software specification. Here’s how you could structure it:

### How to Implement Persistent Context in the App:

#### 1. **Contextual Defaults**
   - Create a set of **default values** that apply to every new software specification, such as:
     - **Preferred Operating Systems**: Fedora for desktop and laptop.
     - **Mobile Platform**: Android.
     - **Always Prefer**: Desktop app (but web UI is acceptable).
     - **Backup Requirements**: Always include questions about data backup options.

#### 2. **Context Management**
   - In the GUI, you can have a section for **Context Settings** where you define these background preferences once, and they will automatically be included in all future spec generations.
   - These settings can be edited in case your preferences change.

#### 3. **Example Code Snippet**
Here’s an example of how to define and use **persistent context** in your Python app:

```python
# Persistent context settings
context_defaults = {
    "operating_systems": ["Fedora (desktop/laptop)", "Android (phone)"],
    "prefer_desktop_app": True,
    "allow_web_ui": True,
    "backup_requirements": "Always require clear user backup options."
}

# Function to add context to GPT prompt
def get_context_info():
    context_info = f"""
    Preferred platforms: {', '.join(context_defaults['operating_systems'])}.
    The user prefers a desktop app, but web UI is acceptable: {context_defaults['allow_web_ui']}.
    Backup requirements: {context_defaults['backup_requirements']}
    """
    return context_info

def ask_gpt(prompt):
    """ Send the prompt to GPT API with contextual information included """
    # Add context to the prompt
    prompt_with_context = get_context_info() + "\n" + prompt
    
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-003",
        prompt=prompt_with_context,
        max_tokens=150,
        temperature=0.5
    )
    return response.choices[0].text.strip()
```

In this code, the function `get_context_info()` returns the predefined context that is then merged with the actual questions sent to GPT. This ensures that your common requirements are included in every query without needing to manually input them each time.

#### 4. **GUI Implementation**
   - The **Context Settings** can be displayed on the main GUI or in a separate settings menu.
   - These settings can be edited if necessary, and the updated context will be used for future specifications.
   - Example settings form:
     - Preferred OS: (default to Fedora/Android)
     - Backup Requirements: (default to "Always require clear user backup options")
     - Desktop App vs Web UI: (default to desktop app preference)

### Workflow:
- When starting a new software spec generation session, the app will automatically include your **default context**. 
- You can still specify unique details for that particular tool, and GPT will take those into account along with the background context.

### Benefits:
- **Efficiency**: You don't need to repeatedly specify the same requirements for every software spec.
- **Customization**: You can override or add unique details for each individual project as needed.
- **Consistency**: Every spec will include important elements like your platform preferences and backup requirements without missing any critical points.

This approach will streamline the process of creating software specs, making it faster and easier for you to generate detailed, personalized requirements without unnecessary repetition. Let me know if you'd like help with more details or implementation!
