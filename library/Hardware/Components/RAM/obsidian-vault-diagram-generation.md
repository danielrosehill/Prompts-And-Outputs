*Note: this repository consists of the outputs of large language models (LLMs). In many cases, these are unedited or minimally edited. The information provided is for demonstrative purposes only and is intended to highlight constraints and capabilities in LLM applications and prompt engineering strategies.*


# Prompt

Please create a few drafts of a mermaid diagram to explain the following flow in my Obsidian vault for managing LLM outputs.

The user saves an output into the output folder
A Python script automatically copies the prompt into the prompt storage folder
The Python script automatically creates bidirectional links between the output file and the prompt file
The whole Vault is periodically synced to B2 cloud storage

# Output

Certainly! I'll create a few drafts of Mermaid diagrams to explain the flow in your Obsidian vault for managing LLM outputs. Here are three different approaches:

1. Simple Linear Flow:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[User] -->|Saves output| B[Output Folder]
    B -->|Triggers| C[Python Script]
    C -->|Copies prompt| D[Prompt Storage Folder]
    C -->|Creates links| E[Bidirectional Links]
    F[Entire Vault] -->|Periodic sync| G[B2 Cloud Storage]
```

2. Detailed Process Flow:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User] -->|Saves output| B[Output Folder]
    B -->|Triggers| C{Python Script}
    C -->|Extracts prompt| D[Prompt Storage Folder]
    C -->|Creates| E[Bidirectional Links]
    E -->|Links| B
    E -->|Links| D
    F[Periodic Sync Process] -->|Syncs| G[Entire Vault]
    G -->|Uploads to| H[B2 Cloud Storage]
    subgraph Obsidian Vault
    B
    D
    E
    G
    end
```

3. Sequence Diagram:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor User
    participant OF as Output Folder
    participant PS as Python Script
    participant PF as Prompt Folder
    participant OV as Obsidian Vault
    participant B2 as B2 Cloud Storage

    User->>OF: Saves output
    OF->>PS: Triggers script
    PS->>PF: Copies prompt
    PS->>OF: Creates link to prompt
    PS->>PF: Creates link to output
    loop Periodically
        OV->>B2: Syncs entire vault
    end
```

These diagrams provide different perspectives on the flow of your Obsidian vault management system for LLM outputs. The first is a simple linear flow, the second provides more detail about the process and the structure of the Obsidian vault, and the third shows the sequence of events including the periodic sync to B2 cloud storage. You can choose the one that best represents your system or use them as a starting point for further refinement.
