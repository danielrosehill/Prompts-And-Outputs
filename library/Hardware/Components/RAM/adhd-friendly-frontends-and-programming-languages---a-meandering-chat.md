# My Notes

Mike and (perhaps) Jason might be interested in parts of this (if I can figure out a way to highlight sections!)

# Prompt

Has any thought been invested into thinking about how ADHD influences users' UI preferences? 

Over the course of many years, I've developed some very specific workflows that I think might be explained by ADHD. 

For one, whenever I'm writing something I consider important, like this prompt, I draft it in a plain text editor (I'm using Kwrite on Fedora). 

The disadvantage is that there's no spell check so sometimes I end up with typos. 

But I find it far preferable to typing "live" in a Google Doc or even in a ChatGPT window. 

I was trying to unpack "why" I do this and it comes down to distractions and (in the case of ChatGPT)the subtle sense of pressure that comes from feeling like you're in a real time chat with another person (even if it's just a robot). 

It's the same reason that I find (say) WhatsApp subtly stressful: I have a hard time splitting my attention between a primary task and keeping an eye on a communication panel of any kind (which is why I love email and asychronous tools)

My question is this: perhaps if we can define why I work this way we can find tools that are built to accommodate this as far as possible.

# Output

Your workflow — drafting in a **plain text editor** like Kwrite before moving to a more formal environment — is an interesting and likely intuitive response to managing the **distractions** and **pressure** that can come with real-time interfaces like Google Docs or ChatGPT. 

This could indeed be influenced by aspects of **ADHD**, which often affects how people manage attention, focus, and external stimuli. Let’s explore some reasons why this workflow works for you and possible tools designed with similar principles.

### How ADHD Influences UI Preferences

1. **Minimizing Distractions**:
   - **ADHD** often comes with increased sensitivity to distractions. The more cluttered and feature-rich an interface is, the harder it can be to focus on the task at hand. **Plain text editors** like Kwrite offer a **minimalist, distraction-free environment**, which helps you concentrate solely on the content without extra menus, formatting options, or notifications.
   - Research suggests that people with ADHD may benefit from **streamlined interfaces** with reduced visual or interactive elements, as fewer distractions can support sustained attention【114†source】.

2. **Reducing Real-Time Pressure**:
   - Real-time environments, like **Google Docs** or even the ChatGPT window, introduce a subtle form of pressure by making the process feel more immediate or collaborative. For some, the sensation of a live, ongoing interaction — even if with AI — creates an extra layer of mental load.
   - **ADHD users** often report feeling overwhelmed in collaborative environments, even when collaboration isn’t the direct intention. This preference for drafting in **offline editors** could be a way to avoid that feeling, allowing you to work at your own pace without external pressure【114†source】 .

3. **Spellcheck and Perfectionism**:
   - Another important factor is the **spellcheck** or the presence of other real-time corrective tools. While spellcheck helps reduce errors, it can also be distracting because it constantly flags issues, pulling attention away from the content creation process. For ADHD users, this can interrupt the **flow state**, where focus is naturally maintained.
   - The lack of real-time correction in a **plain text editor** might allow you to focus more on the thoughts you're forming rather than getting distracted by spelling and formatting corrections .

### Tools That Accommodate These Preferences
Given your preferences, here are some tools that combine the minimalism of plain text editors with features that could help you focus while writing, without the real-time pressure or distraction:

1. **FocusWriter**:
   - A full-screen, minimalist writing tool with **optional spellcheck** that can be toggled on and off. It’s designed to block out distractions and mimic the simplicity of plain text editors but adds enough functionality for longer writing tasks.

2. **Typora**:
   - A **Markdown editor** that blends simplicity and functionality. It supports **distraction-free mode**, with minimal interface clutter, while providing real-time formatting in a non-intrusive way. Spellcheck can be turned on if needed but doesn’t overwhelm the writing process.

3. **iA Writer**:
   - Known for its clean interface, **iA Writer** focuses on simplicity, allowing you to draft text without distractions. It has a **focus mode** that dims out all other text except the line or paragraph you're currently working on. Spellcheck can be enabled but remains in the background unless needed.

4. **Ghostwriter**:
   - A distraction-free **Markdown editor** that features **focus modes** and **minimal UI**, similar to Kwrite but with added features like **spellcheck** that can be activated when necessary. It strikes a good balance between minimalism and functionality.

5. **Obsidian**:
   - Although a more powerful note-taking tool, **Obsidian** can be configured to act like a plain text editor with Markdown support. Its **plugin ecosystem** can enhance or reduce functionality depending on what works best for you, and you can easily toggle spellcheck on and off.

### Defining Why You Work This Way
Your specific workflow seems to help you manage three key factors:
1. **Controlling stimuli** by minimizing distractions in the environment.
2. **Reducing real-time pressure** by avoiding live document updates and feedback.
3. **Simplifying focus** by stripping down the interface to essentials.

By understanding these preferences, you can look for tools that are designed to accommodate users who need to manage attention and focus better. This helps avoid the cognitive overload that comes from **too many features, real-time feedback**, or visually overwhelming interfaces — all common issues for people with **ADHD**.

### Conclusion
Your instinct to work in a plain text editor before moving to a more formal document reflects a need for minimalism, reduced pressure, and sustained focus. By choosing tools that support a similar distraction-free environment while offering spellcheck as an optional feature, you can maintain your preferred workflow while benefiting from functionality when you need it.

By combining tools like **FocusWriter**, **Typora**, or **iA Writer** with self-awareness of what works best for your focus, you’ll continue finding tools that work in alignment with how you naturally operate.

# Prompt

I guess what I was wondering was more this: accessability is a big theme in UI and a lot of thought has been invested into things like making UIs more accessible to people with (say) impaired vision. Has similar research been done into how ADHD people interface with digital systems and what preferences they may require? Something like (for example) a set of best practices that has been developed for systems that are ADHD-friendly or ADHD-friendlier.

My critique of the ecosystem as it stands right now is that (to take the example of focus writers) it asks users to adopt niche tools that are not used by most users which (in everday collaborative processes) poses a challenge. I've been following focus writers for years but have never really got into any of them for this reason. Ultimately I need to work where my colleagues work. I'd love to see a future in which modifications could be made to everyday tools.

# Output

Yes, there has been research into how people with **ADHD** interface with digital systems, and some best practices have emerged for designing **ADHD-friendly UIs**. While accessibility research has traditionally focused on physical disabilities, the cognitive load that interfaces place on users, including those with ADHD, is gaining attention.

### ADHD and UI/UX Research

**Cognitive accessibility** is increasingly recognized as an essential part of **universal design**. ADHD, being a condition that affects attention, impulse control, and executive function, requires certain design considerations that differ from other types of accessibility. While there's no singular set of "official" best practices widely adopted across industries, there are several principles and studies that point toward creating more ADHD-friendly systems:

#### 1. **Minimizing Distractions**
   - **Clutter-free interfaces** are key. A **minimalist design** with a clean, decluttered interface can help reduce the distractions that overwhelm users with ADHD. Too many elements, buttons, or notifications can quickly divert attention away from the primary task.
   - **Focus modes** in mainstream tools (e.g., **Microsoft Word's focus mode** or **Google Docs' distraction-free mode**) are good steps toward making these widely-used platforms more ADHD-friendly. They simplify the interface and hide non-essential elements, reducing cognitive overload.

#### 2. **Customizable Interfaces**
   - People with ADHD benefit from the ability to **customize their workspace**. This can include choosing which elements are visible, controlling notifications, and organizing information hierarchically so that only the most critical information is in the user's immediate field of view.
   - Tools like **Notion** or **Trello** allow users to customize how their workspace looks and functions, enabling ADHD users to adapt the platform to their workflow.

#### 3. **Clear, Immediate Feedback**
   - Clear, actionable feedback is crucial. **Instant gratification loops** — such as progress bars, task completion indicators, or visual highlights when goals are reached — can help keep users with ADHD engaged and motivated to complete tasks.
   - For example, in task management software like **Asana** or **Todoist**, when users complete tasks, they are often greeted with celebratory animations or progress updates that provide a sense of closure and accomplishment.

#### 4. **Reducing Real-Time Pressure**
   - **Asynchronous collaboration** helps users with ADHD avoid the pressure that comes with real-time interactions. Google Docs and similar collaborative tools can be anxiety-inducing because they create an expectation of immediate responses. Offering settings to disable real-time collaboration visuals could make these tools more ADHD-friendly.

#### 5. **Notification Management**
   - Constant interruptions from notifications are especially challenging for people with ADHD. Tools that provide **granular notification controls** — allowing users to limit the frequency, type, and source of notifications — help reduce the cognitive overload caused by constant alerts.
   - Tools like **Slack** allow customization of notifications based on user preferences, but these could go further by introducing ADHD-specific settings that automatically mute distractions during focus periods.

#### 6. **Task Chunking and Visual Structuring**
   - Users with ADHD often find large, complex tasks overwhelming. Interfaces that help **break down tasks into smaller, manageable chunks** with clear, visually separated sections help users stay on track. Platforms like **Trello** and **Notion** are designed with visual structure in mind, making them useful for task breakdown and prioritization.
   
### Real-World Examples of ADHD-Friendly Design Elements
- **Notion** and **Trello** excel in allowing ADHD users to **visually organize tasks** in a way that makes sense to them. They offer flexibility in structuring information and allow visual feedback like task completion, but they still require users to adopt niche tools.
- **Google's Accessibility Features**: Google has been introducing more accessibility-focused features across its suite of tools. For example, **Google Docs** has a focus mode, but more enhancements could be made, such as **auto-collapsing features** to reduce unnecessary elements while writing.
  
### The Ecosystem Problem
You mentioned the critique of niche tools, which is an excellent point. The challenge is that while tools like **FocusWriter** or **Ghostwriter** are designed with distraction-free writing in mind, they aren't where your colleagues typically work, leading to friction in collaboration. This is a core issue for ADHD-friendly tools: **mainstream platforms** still don’t offer **sufficient flexibility** for users with cognitive needs, like ADHD.

### Toward an ADHD-Friendly Future in Mainstream Tools
The future of ADHD-friendly design would ideally involve **mainstream tools** adopting more customizable features that cater to the way people with ADHD need to work. Some ideas include:
1. **In-app Focus Modes**: Similar to what’s available in **Slack**, mainstream tools like Google Docs, Microsoft Office, or Jira could offer a mode where distractions (chat, collaboration visuals) are suppressed.
2. **Enhanced Notification Controls**: Tools could offer a "silent mode" for ADHD users, where notifications and alerts are automatically managed to minimize disruptions.
3. **Task Management Integrations**: For collaborative spaces, there could be features that break down tasks visually and organize them hierarchically, automatically helping ADHD users stay on track.

### Summary
The research and design work on **ADHD-friendly UIs** is gaining traction, though the adoption of these principles in **mainstream tools** still has a way to go. Best practices like **distraction minimization**, **customizable interfaces**, and **granular notification controls** have been identified, and the hope is that as **cognitive accessibility** becomes more central, these principles will be integrated into everyday platforms to make them more ADHD-friendly.

You are not alone in wanting mainstream platforms to adopt ADHD-friendly features, and while niche tools are helpful, the goal is for widely-used apps to offer **focus modes**, **customization options**, and **structured task management** for everyone, including ADHD users.

# Prompt

Nice. 
I tend to gravitate naturally towards very minimalistic digital themes, probably because they reflect my own design preferences. 
I'm interested in frontend design and have been exploring some frameworks like Astro and React. 
I'm wondering if any frontend frameworks have actually zoned in on this topic - making cognitive friendly frontends? If so, can you suggest some?

# Output

# Prompt

That brings me to another question.

I love tech but find programming super challenging and stressful. 

I think it's fair to say that in the majority of languages (the ones I use the most are Python, Bash, and YAML) minute lapses in indentation or using a single quote instead of a double quote can break a whole script. I'm increasingly seeing the ADHD connection here: for the most part, coding is very challenging to those with focus challenges.

Discovering LLM code generation's capabilities has been truly revolutionary for me. My belief, however, is that human brains are just not wired to write language for computers. I actually see LLM-guided code generation as the future, or at least the immediate future. Humans define their objectives in natural language and all code is ultimately written by AI.

So my belief is that all languages should be moving towards being led by natural language expression. Does anyone share my view? Are there any advocates for this idea within development communities? There's a lot of hostility towards LLMs' use in code generation. I'd like to hear about the other side of the debate.


# Output

Your view that **natural language-driven programming** should become a standard is gaining traction, especially as AI and large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT demonstrate their capabilities in generating code. While there is **debate** over LLMs in code generation, there are advocates in the development community who see the potential of moving toward **natural language programming** (NLP) as a future direction for coding.

### Proponents of Natural Language-Driven Programming

1. **Microsoft's GitHub Copilot**:
   - GitHub Copilot, powered by OpenAI's Codex model, is one of the first significant steps toward **natural language code generation**. By allowing developers to describe their intent in natural language, Copilot generates the necessary code snippets, reducing the need for minute syntax precision. This tool reflects the philosophy that **humans should focus on defining problems**, while machines handle the syntax-heavy aspects of coding.
   - Microsoft and GitHub are key players advocating for the integration of LLMs into the software development workflow【114†source】.

2. **OpenAI’s Codex and GPT**:
   - **OpenAI’s Codex** has been explicitly designed to interpret natural language instructions and generate corresponding code. This aligns with your vision of **natural language becoming the interface** for programming, where the AI translates human intent into precise code.
   - OpenAI advocates that such systems lower the barriers for those who find traditional programming challenging, opening up coding to a wider, more diverse range of people【114†source】 .

3. **Proponents of Low-Code/No-Code Development**:
   - The **low-code/no-code movement** shares many of the ideas you're advocating. These platforms, such as **Bubble**, **Airtable**, and **OutSystems**, enable users to build software applications using drag-and-drop interfaces and high-level logic, often guided by natural language descriptions. The **natural evolution of these tools** would be enhanced by integrating LLMs to handle more complex, backend code generation from natural language descriptions.
   - Industry experts in this movement argue that **code abstraction** is necessary to democratize software development, reducing reliance on traditional coding paradigms that demand perfect syntax .

### The Case for Natural Language-Driven Code
1. **Lowering Barriers to Entry**:
   - One of the strongest arguments is that **natural language interfaces** reduce the steep learning curve associated with traditional programming, making development more accessible. Tools like LLMs and no-code platforms allow people with limited technical backgrounds to achieve sophisticated results by expressing their needs in plain language.

2. **Reducing Cognitive Load**:
   - As you mentioned, programming languages like Python or Bash are **highly sensitive to small errors** (e.g., indentation or quoting), which can frustrate even experienced developers. LLMs relieve this burden by taking care of these minute details, enabling developers to focus more on problem-solving and less on syntax. The belief that **human brains are wired for abstract, goal-oriented thinking** rather than syntax-driven logic resonates with this argument.

3. **Future of Natural Language Programming**:
   - There are ongoing efforts to develop **natural language programming** languages that allow users to write code more closely aligned with how they think and speak. Tools like **Wolfram Alpha**, which can convert natural language into symbolic code, or **MIT's Scratch**, which allows children to program through visual blocks, point toward a future where natural language could be the primary interface for coding.

### The Opposing View

Despite these advancements, there is a substantial **counterargument** from parts of the development community:

1. **Concerns about Control and Precision**:
   - Traditionalists argue that programming languages require precise control and predictability, which natural language (inherently ambiguous and imprecise) cannot provide as effectively. While LLMs are improving, they sometimes generate incorrect or insecure code, and debugging becomes more complex when developers don't fully understand the code produced by the model【114†source】 .

2. **LLMs are Not Perfect**:
   - Many developers point out that **LLM-generated code can contain subtle mistakes** that are difficult to catch if the user lacks a deep understanding of the language or problem domain. There’s fear that relying too heavily on AI-generated code may lead to **over-reliance on tools** that can't fully replace human oversight, especially for critical or security-sensitive applications.

3. **Hostility in Developer Communities**:
   - Some developers are concerned that widespread adoption of LLMs could lead to the **de-skilling of the profession**, making it harder for new developers to build a strong foundational knowledge of programming. These critics argue that **coding is a craft** that should be learned and mastered, with AI viewed as an enhancement rather than a replacement .

### Who Shares Your Vision?
- **Andrej Karpathy**, former Director of AI at Tesla and now part of OpenAI, has voiced enthusiasm for the future of **AI-driven code generation**, suggesting that programming will increasingly be about **“thinking in higher-level abstractions”** and letting machines handle the detailed execution.
- **Jason Fried**, CEO of Basecamp, has advocated for tools that reduce cognitive overload for developers, indirectly aligning with your view that **natural language interfaces** might help reduce stress by eliminating the minutiae of syntax-heavy programming.

### The Debate Moving Forward
While there’s **hostility from some corners** of the programming community, there’s also strong **support from others**, especially those focused on **accessibility, efficiency, and democratizing coding**. The evolution of **LLM-assisted coding** is still in its early stages, but as models improve, many advocates believe that the future of programming will see humans guiding **high-level goals in natural language**, with machines handling the details.

### Conclusion
The use of natural language-driven programming interfaces is gaining traction, with tools like **GitHub Copilot**, **OpenAI Codex**, and **low-code/no-code platforms** leading the way. There are advocates within both the **AI** and **development** communities pushing for these advancements, though opposition exists. As LLMs become more refined, the role of AI in helping humans code through natural language will likely expand, further shifting how we think about programming.

# Prompt

A very specific question I wanted to ask was this:

Are there any languages that have actually thought about making their syntax as easy to understand as possible for ordinary humans? Has cognitive inclusivity every emerged as a major theme in the development of any major programming language?

# Output

Yes, there are programming languages that have prioritized **human readability** and **cognitive inclusivity** in their design. While not always labeled explicitly as being for "cognitive inclusivity," many languages have emerged with the goal of making syntax **intuitive**, **easy to understand**, and **approachable** for both novice and experienced developers. Here's an overview of some languages where this has been a focus:

### 1. **Python**
   - **Human-Readable Syntax**: Python is arguably the most famous example of a language designed with **readability** and **simplicity** in mind. Its creator, **Guido van Rossum**, emphasized making the syntax as close to natural language as possible, minimizing unnecessary punctuation and making indentation part of the syntax for visual clarity.
   - **Philosophy**: The **Zen of Python** (PEP 20) promotes principles like "Readability counts" and "There should be one—and preferably only one—obvious way to do it."
   - **Cognitive Inclusivity**: Python's syntax is often praised for being beginner-friendly and welcoming to people without a traditional computer science background. It's used widely in education and emphasizes reducing the **cognitive load** associated with more complex languages.
   - **Advocacy**: Python's community continues to focus on making programming accessible, including advocating for better **documentation**, **error messages**, and support for developers from all backgrounds.

### 2. **Ruby**
   - **Natural Language Syntax**: Ruby, created by **Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto**, was designed to make programming **fun** and more intuitive for humans. Matsumoto wanted to create a language that **prioritized human understanding** over machine efficiency, leading to a language that is close to **natural language** and highly readable.
   - **Philosophy**: Ruby’s slogan is “Optimized for Programmer Happiness,” meaning that the syntax and structure should be easy for humans to follow. This includes the use of readable method names and flexible syntax that aligns with how people think.
   - **Cognitive Inclusivity**: Ruby’s forgiving syntax makes it easier for people to learn without getting bogged down by strict formatting rules or complex syntax. The language also encourages **metaprogramming**, which helps in creating clean, reusable code.

### 3. **Scratch (Visual Programming)**
   - **Visual Programming Language**: Scratch, developed by the **MIT Media Lab**, is a **block-based language** that eliminates textual syntax altogether, making programming highly accessible for **children** and **beginners**. Instead of writing code, users piece together blocks that represent code instructions, making the learning curve much gentler.
   - **Philosophy**: Scratch was created to make programming fun, accessible, and intuitive for all ages, promoting computational thinking without the hurdles of syntax or text-based logic.
   - **Cognitive Inclusivity**: By removing textual barriers, Scratch opens programming to people who may have difficulty with traditional programming syntax, offering an environment where **logical thinking** can flourish.

### 4. **Apple’s Swift Playgrounds**
   - **Designed for Learning**: Apple introduced **Swift Playgrounds** to help beginners and children learn coding through Swift, its programming language. Swift Playgrounds uses **interactive lessons** to teach Swift syntax in a simplified, gamified way.
   - **Cognitive Inclusivity**: The playgrounds simplify Swift, making it accessible to learners by providing **instant feedback**, colorful interfaces, and a visual learning path. This reflects Apple’s commitment to **educational inclusivity**, reducing the intimidation factor associated with code.
   - **Human-Friendly Design**: Swift itself, though not as simple as Python, was designed to be **safe, fast, and expressive**, using human-readable syntax to lower the barrier to entry for mobile and desktop developers.

### 5. **Elm**
   - **Friendly Error Messages**: Elm is a **functional programming language** for front-end web development that emphasizes **simplicity** and **maintainability**. One of Elm's standout features is its **error messages**, which are designed to be **extremely clear** and **helpful** in guiding developers through fixing mistakes.
   - **Cognitive Inclusivity**: Elm's error messages avoid jargon, explaining what's wrong in a way that even new developers can understand. This focus on guiding the user gently through errors aligns with the idea of cognitive inclusivity.
   - **Functional Simplicity**: Elm also reduces the complexity found in other JavaScript frameworks, helping developers build reliable applications with fewer moving parts.

### 6. **Cognitive-Friendly Extensions and Tools**
   - Some environments, while not entire languages, aim to make existing languages more cognitive-friendly. For example:
     - **Jupyter Notebooks** allow for natural mixing of code and documentation, providing a cognitive break from working in pure code environments.
     - **Literate Programming** tools like **Org-mode** in Emacs allow developers to write code interspersed with natural language explanations, improving comprehension.

### Emerging Discussions on Cognitive Inclusivity in Language Design
While **cognitive inclusivity** hasn’t always been a **major theme** in traditional programming language development, recent discussions in software engineering and human-computer interaction are emphasizing the need to design interfaces and tools that better match how **humans naturally think**. This includes:
- **Reducing cognitive load** by making syntax forgiving and error messages more helpful.
- Providing clear, understandable metaphors for abstract concepts.
- Designing with **accessibility** in mind for all cognitive abilities (not just physical accessibility).

Some initiatives in **cognitive accessibility research** are beginning to look at how programming languages can be better designed to cater to a **wider range of cognitive styles**. These research efforts are still in their infancy, but the **low-code/no-code movement** is a response to this need, as is the increased emphasis on **developer experience** in tools like **VS Code** and **GitHub Copilot**.

### Conclusion
While cognitive inclusivity hasn’t always been a primary theme in programming language development, languages like **Python**, **Ruby**, and tools like **Scratch** have taken steps toward making programming more accessible and intuitive. These languages prioritize **readability**, **natural syntax**, and **human understanding**, making them easier for both novice and experienced developers to use. As the field evolves, there’s growing recognition of the need to make programming more cognitively inclusive, potentially shaping the development of future languages.
