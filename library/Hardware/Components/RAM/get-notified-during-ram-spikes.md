# Prompt

Is there a for fedora that can give you notifications if your ram utilitsation exceeds a certain percentage (or amount)?

# Output

Yes, there are several tools for Fedora Linux that can help you monitor your RAM usage and set up notifications when the utilization exceeds a certain threshold. Here are a few options:

1. **GNOME Shell Extensions**:
   - If you're using the GNOME desktop environment, there are extensions like [Vitals](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1460/vitals/) that can show CPU, RAM, disk, and network usage in the top bar. While these extensions don't natively provide notifications, you can keep an eye on memory usage in real-time.

2. **System Monitor Tools with Alerts**:
   - **Glances**: Glances is a cross-platform system monitoring tool with a web-based interface. You can set thresholds for RAM usage and configure alerts or notifications.
     - Installation: `sudo dnf install glances`
     - After installing, you can run it with `glances`, and set threshold configurations in its configuration file.

3. **Bash Script + Notify-send**:
   - You can write a custom bash script that checks your RAM usage at regular intervals and triggers a notification when a threshold is exceeded. For instance:
     ```bash
     #!/bin/bash
     while true; do
       mem_usage=$(free | grep Mem | awk '{print $3/$2 * 100.0}')
       threshold=80.0  # Set the threshold percentage
       if (( $(echo "$mem_usage > $threshold" | bc -l) )); then
         notify-send "High RAM Usage" "Your RAM usage is above $threshold%. It's currently at $mem_usage%."
       fi
       sleep 60  # Check every 60 seconds
     done
     ```
     You can run this script in the background, and it will use the `notify-send` command to display a desktop notification when RAM usage exceeds the threshold.

4. **Monitor via Conky**:
   - **Conky** is a lightweight system monitor that you can configure to monitor various system parameters, including RAM usage. You can also create alerts using custom scripts tied to Conky's configuration.

Let me know if you'd like assistance with setting up any of these options!
