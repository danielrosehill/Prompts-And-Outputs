# Prompt

Regarding Laravel Nova: there were aspects of the development process that were good and those which were bad (for me). Let's start with the good. It was pretty easy to get the basic scaffold going and spin up a web server and start seeing how my app would come together. It looked like it would be pretty easy to customise the CRUD pages for the various tables in my app. I liked the fact that (at least in theory) the data relationships were automatically detected and created as UI components. The stuff I didn't like: it was very difficult to define schemas for my database and when I was trying to recreate them from the remote it felt like I was fighting against the system. The fact that every model had to then be defined into a resource before being useable felt like a lot of unnecessary prep work too. I'd like something a bit simpler. I would like to say "here's my database, here are the tables, and I need to build a CRUD page for these fields". Any other Laravel tools that might be more aligned with my expectations?
