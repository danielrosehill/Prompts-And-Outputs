*Note: this repository consists of the outputs of large language models (LLMs). In many cases, these are unedited or minimally edited. The information provided is for demonstrative purposes only and is intended to highlight constraints and capabilities in LLM applications and prompt engineering strategies.*


# Prompt

I'm trying to find an LLM that is capable of taking a natural language vision for a python programme and generating the code. You can see an example in the markdown file that I attached.  Please provide an exhaustive list of all the LLMs you are aware of that could support this application, starting with the most appropriate option and concluding with those which are less strong fits. Recommend as many options as you can think of. And for each, provide a bit of detail about the LLM.
