# Prompt

Thank you, that helps a lot. Perhaps you can give me some thoughts on the potential uses for this computer in my exploration of LLMs. If I go for the 96GB RAM target rather than 128GB ... what kind of things could I do that I can't do with the current spec? Assume that the rest of the hardware stays basically as is. How many years do you think I could plan to get out of this HW? 

# Output

Upgrading your computer's RAM to **96GB** rather than the full 128GB would significantly boost its capabilities, especially when exploring **Large Language Models (LLMs)** or other resource-intensive tasks. Here’s how this upgrade could benefit your AI and machine learning work, and how it impacts the longevity of your system.

### Potential Uses for Your Computer with 96GB RAM in LLM Exploration

1. **Larger Model Inference**:
   - With 96GB of RAM, you could run **larger language models** locally for inference (the process of using pre-trained models to generate results). Models with **up to 20B parameters**, such as **GPT-NeoX (20B)** or **LLaMA 2 (13B)**, will run more efficiently, especially when handling **large datasets** or processing **complex queries**.
   - The additional RAM helps in loading larger portions of the model into memory, reducing bottlenecks caused by swapping data between storage and memory.

2. **Enhanced Multi-tasking**:
   - AI experiments often involve multiple processes: **data preprocessing**, **model inference**, **result storage**, and **visualization**. With 96GB of RAM, you could run all these processes simultaneously without running into memory limitations, allowing for a smoother workflow and less risk of system crashes due to memory exhaustion.
   
3. **Fine-Tuning Medium-Size Models**:
   - Fine-tuning pre-trained models (adjusting them with custom datasets) on **medium-sized LLMs** (like **GPT-2**, **BERT**, or **LLaMA 2 (13B)**) becomes more feasible with 96GB of RAM. While large-scale fine-tuning (e.g., GPT-3 level) would still require more GPU power, you can efficiently fine-tune smaller models on specific tasks.
   
4. **Running Data-Heavy Applications**:
   - If you're handling large datasets, such as those involving **natural language processing (NLP)**, **data analytics**, or **big data**, the 96GB of RAM will allow you to store larger datasets directly in memory, reducing the time spent on disk I/O.
   - This will also be beneficial when processing large text corpora or preparing data for AI experiments.

5. **Virtualization and Experimentation**:
   - The upgraded RAM would allow you to comfortably run **virtual machines** (VMs) or **Docker containers**, useful for experimenting with different software environments, AI libraries, and tools. You could set up separate environments to run various versions of LLMs or tools like **PyTorch**, **TensorFlow**, or even **Hugging Face** models.

6. **Faster Data Preprocessing**:
   - In AI workflows, preprocessing text data (tokenization, cleaning, batching) is memory-intensive. With more RAM, you can batch-process larger chunks of data, speeding up the preparation phase of AI projects.

### What You Can’t Do with the Current Spec (32GB RAM):
- **Limited Model Size**: With 32GB, you're limited to running **smaller models** (less than 6B parameters) efficiently, such as **GPT-2**, **DistilGPT**, or **LLaMA 7B**. You might struggle with performance and memory errors when handling larger models.
- **Reduced Multi-tasking**: You may experience frequent slowdowns or crashes when trying to run multiple tasks at once (e.g., model inference and data processing), as the system may run out of memory.
- **Limited Fine-Tuning Capabilities**: Fine-tuning even medium-sized models is difficult due to the RAM constraints, and it would require more swapping between memory and storage, leading to slower performance.

### Longevity of the System with 96GB RAM

- **AI Workloads**: With **96GB RAM**, your system would be well-suited to handle **AI inference** and **medium-sized model training** for at least the next **3 to 5 years**, depending on how quickly AI models evolve in complexity. You'll be able to keep up with most cutting-edge LLM research up to the 20B parameter range. For larger models, cloud services or dedicated AI hardware would be needed.
  
- **General Computing**: Outside of AI, 96GB of RAM will future-proof your system for **high-performance tasks** (such as video editing, 3D rendering, and software development). This amount of memory will keep your system competitive for **5+ years** in most productivity and creative workflows.
  
- **Emerging AI Applications**: Given that LLMs are rapidly evolving, newer models are becoming more efficient in both size and training techniques. With 96GB RAM, you’ll be able to keep experimenting with optimized models designed to run on consumer hardware, which will likely emerge in the next few years.

### Cost Efficiency of 96GB vs. 128GB
- **Cost Consideration**: The 96GB upgrade (adding 2 x 32GB sticks) is a cost-effective approach that doesn’t require replacing your existing RAM. This gives you a significant boost in capability without wasting the **2 x 16GB sticks** you currently have.
- **Balanced Performance**: 96GB strikes a good balance between capability and cost. While 128GB might be slightly more future-proof, the performance difference for your current needs might not justify the higher cost unless you’re planning on handling extremely large datasets or running very high-end workloads locally.

### Conclusion

- **For LLM experimentation**, the jump from 32GB to 96GB will open up new possibilities, particularly around handling **larger models** (up to 20B parameters) and working with more complex datasets. 
- You should comfortably get **3-5 years** out of this setup, as it will continue to support medium-to-large AI workloads and future advancements in AI software and optimized models.
- **96GB** is a solid middle ground between performance and cost, and it will allow you to continue your AI research and exploration without wasting your current investment in RAM.
