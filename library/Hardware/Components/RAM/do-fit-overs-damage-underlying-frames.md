Summary: You asked if fit-over glasses can damage the frames underneath.

Fit-over glasses generally shouldn't damage the frames underneath if they’re designed well and fit properly. However, there are a few factors to watch for to avoid potential wear or damage:

1. Weight and Pressure: Heavy fit-over glasses can place pressure on the underlying frames, which might lead to discomfort or slight warping over time, especially if worn frequently.


2. Scratching and Friction: If the fit-over glasses don't have a secure fit, they could rub against the underlying frames and potentially cause minor scratches or scuffs.


3. Frame Material: More delicate frame materials, like softer metals or plastics, may be more prone to subtle wear than sturdier materials.



To reduce the risk of damage, look for fit-overs with padded or rubberized edges where they contact the underlying frames. Properly fitting options that don’t shift around on your face are also less likely to cause wear.
