# Prompt
Hmm. Perhaps it's better to just think about frameworks for building business apps rather than finished applications as it doesn't seem like there are great options out there. Anything more along those lines?

# Output
If you're open to exploring frameworks specifically designed to build custom business applications, there are several powerful tools that cater to various needs, ranging from full-stack frameworks to those focusing on specific aspects of application development. These frameworks allow you to build highly customized solutions tailored to your business requirements.

### 1. **Django**
   - **Description**: Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. It's particularly strong in building business applications due to its robust ORM, built-in admin interface, and emphasis on reusable code.
   - **Features**: Django provides a powerful ORM, user authentication, permissions, and a built-in admin panel that can be easily customized. It’s well-suited for complex business logic and integrates well with Postgres.

### 2. **Ruby on Rails**
   - **Description**: Ruby on Rails (Rails) is a popular web application framework written in Ruby. It's known for its "convention over configuration" approach, which speeds up development. Rails is often used for building business applications due to its powerful features and developer-friendly tools.
   - **Features**: Rails comes with an excellent ORM (ActiveRecord), built-in testing, and extensive libraries (gems) for various functionalities. It's ideal for rapidly developing data-driven business applications.

### 7. **Phoenix Framework**
   - **Description**: Phoenix is a web framework built with Elixir, designed for high-performance applications. It’s well-suited for business applications that require real-time features, such as chat systems, dashboards, or live updates.
   - **Features**: Phoenix offers a powerful abstraction layer over Postgres with Ecto (its database wrapper), and it’s highly concurrent, making it ideal for applications that need to scale.
   - **Link**: [Phoenix Framework](https://www.phoenixframework.org/)

### 8. **Vaadin**
   - **Description**: Vaadin is a Java framework for building modern web applications with a focus on business applications. It allows you to build UIs using Java (or Kotlin) and offers a rich set of components.
   - **Features**: Vaadin is particularly strong in creating enterprise applications that require a lot of form-based input, dashboards, and complex workflows. It integrates well with Spring Boot and other Java-based technologies.
