# Prompt

Please generate a few codeblocks for mermaid diagrams to explain the prompt generation process in Output Hub.

The user wants to create a prompt
The prompt is stored as a draft
The prompt is iterated
When the prompt is good enough, it moves into the production prompt library

Then the prompt can be used for outputs

The outputs and prompt can be compared and in this way the prompt can be iteratively improved

# Output

Certainly! I'll create a few Mermaid diagrams to explain the prompt generation process in Output Hub, focusing on the workflow you've described. Here are the codeblocks for these diagrams:

1. Basic Prompt Creation and Iteration Flow:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Creates Prompt] --> B[Store as Draft]
    B --> C[Iterate on Prompt]
    C --> D{Good Enough?}
    D -->|No| C
    D -->|Yes| E[Move to Production Library]
    E --> F[Use for Outputs]
    F --> G[Compare Outputs with Prompt]
    G --> H{Need Improvement?}
    H -->|Yes| C
    H -->|No| I[Keep in Production]
```

2. Prompt Lifecycle:

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Draft
    Draft --> Iteration
    Iteration --> Draft
    Iteration --> Production
    Production --> InUse
    InUse --> Evaluation
    Evaluation --> Iteration
    Evaluation --> Production
```

3. Prompt Improvement Cycle:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Create Prompt] --> B[Draft]
    B --> C[Iterate]
    C --> D[Production]
    D --> E[Generate Outputs]
    E --> F[Analyze Results]
    F --> G[Identify Improvements]
    G --> C
```

4. User Interaction with Prompt System:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor User
    participant Draft
    participant Production
    participant Outputs

    User->>Draft: Create New Prompt
    loop Iteration
        User->>Draft: Refine Prompt
    end
    User->>Production: Approve Prompt
    Production->>Outputs: Generate Outputs
    User->>Outputs: Review Outputs
    User->>Production: Update Prompt (if needed)
```

These diagrams illustrate the prompt generation process in Output Hub, showing:

1. The overall flow from creation to production use and iterative improvement.
2. The lifecycle states a prompt can be in.
3. The cyclical nature of prompt improvement based on output analysis.
4. The user's interaction with the system throughout the process.

These visualizations should help users understand how prompts are created, refined, and used within the Output Hub system, emphasizing the iterative improvement process based on output analysis.
