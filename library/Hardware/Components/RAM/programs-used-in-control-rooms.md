# Prompt

In Hollywood depictions of control rooms, people are often depicted surrounded by screens which show live visualisations of information and news feeds. Do these kind of systems really exist? And if so, are there standard programs for displaying this kind of information in crisis management and control room settings?

# Output

Yes, systems similar to those depicted in Hollywood do exist in real-world crisis management and control room settings, though they are often more practical and less dramatized than their on-screen counterparts. These systems, commonly known as command and control centers or emergency operations centers (EOCs), use various software and hardware solutions to display critical information and facilitate decision-making during crises.

Several standard programs and technologies are used in these settings:

1. Emergency Management Software:
   - Sahana Eden: An open-source disaster management platform that offers modules for resource management, situational awareness, and logistics[7].
   - WebEOC: A widely used crisis management system, though it's primarily for government agencies[5].
   - D4H: Cloud-based incident management software with real-time collaboration tools and mass notification capabilities[2][4].

2. Geographic Information Systems (GIS):
   - ArcGIS Emergency Management by ESRI: Provides geospatial tools for situational awareness and data visualization[4].

3. Data Visualization and Dashboard Tools:
   - Many emergency management platforms include built-in visualization tools.
   - Some organizations use general-purpose data visualization software like Tableau or Power BI to create custom dashboards.

4. Integrated Communication Systems:
   - Platforms like Everbridge offer multi-channel communication capabilities for crisis alerts[2].

5. Video Wall Management Systems:
   - These systems allow for the display of multiple data sources on large screen arrays, similar to what's often depicted in movies[6].

6. AI and Machine Learning Integration:
   - Advanced systems are beginning to incorporate AI for automated alerting, prioritization, and data analysis[6].

7. Social Media Monitoring Tools:
   - Software like Hootsuite or Sprout Social is often used to monitor social media for crisis-related information[2].

While Hollywood depictions often exaggerate the sophistication and seamlessness of these systems, real-world command centers do use advanced technology to aggregate and display critical information. The exact setup varies depending on the organization's needs, budget, and the specific types of crises they manage.

It's worth noting that effective crisis management relies not just on technology, but also on well-trained personnel, clear protocols, and effective leadership. The technology serves to support human decision-making rather than replace it entirely.
