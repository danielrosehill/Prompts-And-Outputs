# Prompt

I'm running into a frequent issue on my fedora computer in which my RAM mushrooms to 20GB usage which is way more than it should be. The cause of this is unknown: when I look into the various system monitors, the usage doesn't add up to that or even close. How can I find out the cause of this mysterious resource balooning?

This message from **DNF** indicates that downloaded packages are temporarily saved in the cache until the next successful installation or update transaction. You can manually clear this cached data to free up disk space. Here's a guide on how to manage the DNF cache:

### **Understanding the DNF Cache**
- **DNF Cache**: When you install or update packages, DNF downloads and stores the packages in a cache directory (`/var/cache/dnf/`). These cached files remain there until a successful transaction completes or until you manually clean them up.
- **Why Clear the Cache**: Over time, these cached packages can accumulate and take up disk space. Clearing them can help free up space, especially if you're not using them.

### **Commands to Manage the DNF Cache**

#### 1. **Clean Cached Packages**
To remove only the cached packages, run:
```bash
sudo dnf clean packages
```
This command will remove all downloaded packages from the cache but will leave other metadata (e.g., package lists) intact.

#### 2. **Clean All Cached Files**
If you want to clean all cached files, including metadata and downloaded packages, use:
```bash
sudo dnf clean all
```
This command will completely clear the DNF cache, forcing DNF to download fresh metadata and packages during the next transaction.

#### 3. **View Cache Usage**
To see how much space the DNF cache is currently using, you can check the size of the `/var/cache/dnf/` directory:
```bash
du -sh /var/cache/dnf/
```

#### 4. **Check Cache Settings**
If you want to change how long DNF stores cached packages or how frequently the cache is cleaned, you can adjust the settings in the DNF configuration file (`/etc/dnf/dnf.conf`).

---

**Summary**: The message suggests that you can clean up cached packages to save disk space using the `dnf clean packages` command. If you want to clear all cached metadata and packages, `dnf clean all` will accomplish this.
