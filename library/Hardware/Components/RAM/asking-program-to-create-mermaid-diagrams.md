# Prompt

Great. How about we try to add a few diagrams to this. I know that you can't directly generate them but are you able to generate codeblocks for Mermaid that I can then run? If you can, please generate a few diagrams that will be helpful in explaining the architecture and the connections between the collections

# Output

Certainly! I'd be happy to provide you with Mermaid codeblocks for diagrams that can help explain the architecture and connections between collections in your Output Hub project. Here are a few diagrams that should be helpful:

1. System Architecture Diagram:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User] -->|Interacts with| B[Web Interface]
    B -->|Sends requests to| C[Node.js Server]
    C -->|Uses| D[Express.js]
    C -->|Authenticates with| E[Passport.js]
    C -->|Manages data with| F[Mongoose ODM]
    F -->|Connects to| G[MongoDB Atlas]
    C -->|Integrates with| H[LLM API]
    C -->|Generates admin panel with| I[AdminJS]
    J[Heroku/DigitalOcean] -->|Hosts| C
```

2. Data Model and Relationships:

```mermaid
erDiagram
    USERS ||--o{ AGENTS : creates
    USERS ||--o{ PROMPTS : creates
    USERS ||--o{ OUTPUTS : creates
    USERS ||--o{ FOLLOW-UP-ACTIVITIES : creates
    AGENTS ||--o{ PROMPTS : used-by
    AGENTS ||--o{ OUTPUTS : generates
    PROMPTS ||--|| OUTPUTS : generates
    OUTPUTS ||--o{ FOLLOW-UP-ACTIVITIES : has
    PROMPTS }o--o{ TAGS : has
    OUTPUTS }o--o{ TAGS : has
```

3. Authentication Flow:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Frontend
    participant Backend
    participant Database

    User->>Frontend: Enter credentials
    Frontend->>Backend: Send login request
    Backend->>Database: Verify credentials
    Database-->>Backend: Return user data
    Backend->>Backend: Generate JWT
    Backend-->>Frontend: Send JWT
    Frontend->>Frontend: Store JWT
    Frontend-->>User: Display logged in state
```

4. Prompt Execution Flow:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Frontend
    participant Backend
    participant LLM API
    participant Database

    User->>Frontend: Click "Run Prompt" button
    Frontend->>Backend: Send prompt execution request
    Backend->>Database: Retrieve prompt data
    Database-->>Backend: Return prompt data
    Backend->>LLM API: Send prompt to LLM
    LLM API-->>Backend: Return generated output
    Backend->>Database: Save output
    Database-->>Backend: Confirm save
    Backend-->>Frontend: Send output data
    Frontend-->>User: Display output
```

These Mermaid diagrams should provide a visual representation of:

1. The overall system architecture
2. The data model and relationships between collections
3. The authentication flow
4. The process of executing a prompt and saving its output

You can copy these codeblocks and paste them into a Mermaid-compatible renderer to generate the actual diagrams. These visuals should help in explaining the structure and flow of your Output Hub project.
