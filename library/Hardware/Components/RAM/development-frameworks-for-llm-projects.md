*Note: this repository consists of the outputs of large language models (LLMs). In many cases, these are unedited or minimally edited. The information provided is for demonstrative purposes only and is intended to highlight constraints and capabilities in LLM applications and prompt engineering strategies.*


# Prompt

Let me take a step back. Let's say that I want to explore developing my own LLM apps generally. This assistant idea is a good case study but there might be many more ideas I have for LLM agents. Firstly, I'll want to leverage existing APIs rather than host my own LLMs. Are there any development frameworks intended for helping build this kind of project? 

# Output

There are several development frameworks designed to help developers build LLM-based applications using existing APIs, making it easier to create and manage LLM-powered agents. Here are some of the top frameworks and tools that could be useful for your projects:
