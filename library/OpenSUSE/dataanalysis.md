wget https://download.rapidminer.com/installer/RapidMiner-Studio-latest-linux.zip
unzip RapidMiner-Studio-latest-linux.zip
./RapidMiner-Studio.sh
```

## 4. Weka

Weka is a collection of machine learning algorithms for data mining tasks. It includes tools for data preprocessing, classification, regression, clustering, association rules, and visualization.

**Installation Command:**

```bash
sudo zypper install weka
```

## 5. SciDAVis

SciDAVis is an interactive application for data analysis and publication-quality plotting. It is ideal for users who need to perform scientific data analysis and create high-quality plots.

**Installation Command:**

```bash
sudo zypper install scidavis
```

## 6. Scikit-learn (Python)

Scikit-learn is a widely used Python library for machine learning that offers tools for classification, regression, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and more.

**Installation Command:**

```bash
sudo zypper install python3-scikit-learn
```

## 7. Pandas (Python)

Pandas is an essential Python library for data manipulation and analysis. It provides powerful tools for handling structured data like DataFrames.

**Installation Command:**

```bash
sudo zypper install python3-pandas
```

## 8. Apache Spark

Apache Spark is a powerful engine for big data processing with built-in modules for streaming, SQL, machine learning (MLlib), and graph processing (GraphX).

**Installation Command:**\
You can install Spark by downloading it from the official website or using the following steps:

```bash
sudo zypper install java-11-openjdk
wget https://downloads.apache.org/spark/spark-3.5.0/spark-3.5.0-bin-hadoop3.tgz
tar -xvzf spark-3.5.0-bin-hadoop3.tgz
cd spark-3.5.0-bin-hadoop3/
./bin/spark-shell
```

These tools provide a robust set of features for various data mining tasks on openSUSE, from beginner-friendly visual programming environments to advanced machine learning libraries\[1]\[2]\[5].
