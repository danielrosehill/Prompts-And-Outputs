**Prompt Summary:** You are asking for KDE themes that make the display easier on the eyes but aren't fully black, as you find dark mode too dark.

---

Here are some KDE Plasma themes that offer a softer, less harsh visual experience compared to typical dark mode, providing a middle ground:

### **1. Arc Theme (Arc-Darker)**
   - **Description:** The **Arc** theme family includes **Arc-Darker**, which is a great compromise between dark and light themes. It has a dark title bar and panel but uses lighter colors for the main application window, making it easier on the eyes than full dark mode.
   - **Why It Works:**
     - Soft dark tones with light areas reduce eye strain.
     - Good contrast without being harsh or fully dark.

### **2. Breeze Twilight**
   - **Description:** **Breeze Twilight** is a hybrid theme that combines elements of both light and dark modes. It uses a dark panel (taskbar) with light application windows, creating a balanced and comfortable display. 
   - **Why It Works:**
     - Dark elements help reduce glare, while lighter window backgrounds keep content legible and soft.
     - Feels less intense than full dark mode while still reducing brightness.

### **3. Materia (Materia Light/Darker)**
   - **Description:** **Materia** is a modern theme that has several variations, including **Materia Light** and **Materia Darker**. Materia Darker is a softer dark theme with a lighter color palette that’s not fully black, creating a calm and easy-on-the-eyes effect.
   - **Why It Works:**
     - Muted, softer dark tones with subtle highlights.
     - Uses lighter greys rather than black, making it more comfortable for prolonged use.

### **4. Nord**
   - **Description:** **Nord** is a popular theme inspired by arctic tones, using cool blues and subtle contrasts instead of deep blacks. It’s designed to be gentle on the eyes, with a slightly darker but not fully dark appearance.
   - **Why It Works:**
     - Gentle color scheme that feels relaxing and easy to focus on.
     - Blue and grey shades provide a good balance for readability without the harshness of black.

### **5. Sweet Light**
   - **Description:** **Sweet Light** is a light version of the Sweet theme, with soft, pastel accents. It’s more colorful than a standard theme but still maintains a clean look without the starkness of black.
   - **Why It Works:**
     - Soft, muted colors make the interface feel inviting without straining the eyes.
     - A good option for those who want something brighter than a dark theme but less glaring than standard light themes.

### **6. Adapta Nokto**
   - **Description:** **Adapta Nokto** is another softer dark theme that uses darker greys and blues instead of black. It’s often described as easy on the eyes and suitable for long periods of use.
   - **Why It Works:**
     - Muted colors, balanced contrast, and softer tones help prevent eye fatigue.
     - Provides a good mix of dark interface elements without going fully black.

### **7. Qogir Dark (Soft Dark)**
   - **Description:** **Qogir Dark** is a theme that strikes a nice balance between dark and light. It doesn’t use pure black, opting for dark greys that are easy to look at without feeling too heavy.
   - **Why It Works:**
     - Dark grey backgrounds with softer, more neutral tones.
     - Subtle design without the aggressive contrasts found in full dark themes.

### **How to Install and Apply These Themes**
1. **Install Themes via KDE Store:**
   - Open **System Settings** → **Appearance** → **Global Theme** or **Plasma Style**.
   - Click on **Get New Global Themes** or **Get New Plasma Styles**, and search for the theme names mentioned.
   - Download and apply the theme directly from there.

2. **Adjust Colors Manually (Optional):**
   - You can further customize the colors to make any theme softer by going to **System Settings** → **Appearance** → **Colors** and adjusting the **Color Scheme**.
   - This lets you tweak specific colors (e.g., make the background slightly lighter) to match your preference.

### **Recommendation**
For a more comfortable visual experience, try starting with **Arc-Darker** or **Breeze Twilight** for a hybrid approach that softens dark elements. **Nord** is great if you prefer cooler tones that aren't black, and **Materia Darker** offers a nice in-between. You can always fine-tune colors to find the perfect balance.
