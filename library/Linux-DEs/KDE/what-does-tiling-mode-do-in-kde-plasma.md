**Prompt Summary:** You are asking about the functionality of using `Super + T` on KDE Plasma to enable a tiling window manager and what its purpose is.

---

When you press `Super + T` on KDE Plasma, it activates a basic **tiling window mode**. This mode is intended to provide a more efficient way of organizing and managing open windows by automatically arranging them on your screen without overlapping, similar to how traditional tiling window managers (like i3 or Sway) function. Here’s what you can do with this mode:

### **Purpose of Tiling Mode in KDE Plasma**
1. **Efficient Screen Use:**
   - Tiling windows ensures that you make the most out of your screen space. Instead of manually resizing and arranging windows, tiling automatically arranges them side by side, allowing you to see multiple applications simultaneously.
   - This is particularly useful if you're working on multiple tasks or referencing information across different windows.

2. **Quick Window Management:**
   - If you frequently switch between applications, tiling can help keep everything visible and accessible without overlapping windows. This means less time spent alt-tabbing and more time focusing on your tasks.
   - It’s also beneficial for multi-monitor setups, where you want to keep different sets of applications visible on each screen.

3. **Keyboard-Centric Workflow:**
   - Tiling modes, like the one enabled with `Super + T`, allow you to manage windows primarily using keyboard shortcuts, reducing the need for mouse interactions.
   - This can improve productivity, especially for users who prefer keyboard-centric workflows (similar to what’s common in dedicated tiling window managers).

### **How to Use Tiling Mode on KDE Plasma**
Once you've activated tiling mode:
1. **Open Applications:**
   - Start opening applications as usual. Each new window you open will automatically be tiled next to or below the existing ones, depending on available space.
2. **Reorganize Tiles:**
   - Move windows around by dragging them to new positions, and they will snap into place within the grid.
   - You can also resize windows, and the rest will adjust to maintain the tiling pattern.
3. **Exit Tiling Mode:**
   - To disable tiling mode, press `Super + T` again, or close some windows, and the default window management behavior will resume.

### **Keyboard Shortcuts in Tiling Mode**
Here are a few handy keyboard shortcuts that work well with tiling:
- **Move Windows:** Use `Alt + Left/Right/Up/Down Arrow` to snap windows into different positions.
- **Resize Windows:** Hold `Alt` and drag with the mouse, or use `Shift + Arrow Keys` (with some configurations) to adjust window sizes.
- **Close Active Window:** Use `Alt + F4` or `Ctrl + W`.

### **Limitations and Considerations**
- **Not as Advanced as Dedicated Tiling WMs:** KDE's tiling is more basic compared to dedicated tiling window managers like i3 or bspwm. It’s mainly for quick, temporary arrangements rather than full control over window tiling layouts.
- **Manual Adjustment May Still Be Required:** Sometimes, you might need to manually resize or rearrange windows if the automatic tiling doesn’t work as expected.

### **When to Use Tiling Mode**
- **Coding or Development Work:** When you need to see code, documentation, and terminal windows at the same time.
- **Research and Writing:** When you want a browser, note-taking app, and word processor all visible.
- **Multitasking Workflows:** When you're working on a project that requires monitoring data, chat windows, or other applications simultaneously.

KDE Plasma's tiling mode is a simple way to quickly manage multiple windows, and it provides a hint of the more advanced tiling behavior found in dedicated tiling window managers. For users who need just a bit of tiling functionality without fully switching away from KDE, it’s a convenient feature.
