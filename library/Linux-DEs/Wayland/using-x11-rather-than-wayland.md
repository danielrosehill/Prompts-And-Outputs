Yes, it is entirely possible to use **X11** instead of **Wayland** with **KDE Plasma**. KDE Plasma supports both **X11** and **Wayland** display servers, and you can easily switch between them. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

### Steps to Switch from Wayland to X11 in KDE Plasma

1. **Logout of Your Current Session**:
   - First, **logout** from your current Wayland session. You can do this from the **KDE Application Menu** by selecting **Log Out**.

2. **Access the Login Screen (SDDM)**:
   - After logging out, you'll be taken to the **login screen**. KDE Plasma uses **SDDM** (Simple Desktop Display Manager) as its default login manager.

3. **Select X11 Session**:
   - On the login screen, look for a **session type menu**. This is usually indicated by a small icon (such as a gear icon) located either near the **password field** or at the **top-right** or **bottom-left** of the screen.
   - Click on this icon, and a list of session types should appear.
   - Select **"Plasma (X11)"** from the list. 

4. **Login**:
   - Enter your password as usual and **log in**. This time, KDE Plasma will launch using the **X11** display server instead of Wayland.

### Making X11 the Default Display Server
If you prefer to use **X11** consistently instead of Wayland, you can configure the system to default to an X11 session:

1. **Ensure Your Preferred Session Is Selected**:
   - The display manager (SDDM) will remember your last session choice. If you select **Plasma (X11)** and log in, it will automatically use **X11** for subsequent logins unless changed.

2. **Check SDDM Configuration** (Optional):
   - If you'd like to explicitly define the default session in the **SDDM configuration file**, you can do so:
     - Open the SDDM configuration file with a text editor (using root privileges):
       ```bash
       sudo nano /etc/sddm.conf
       ```
     - If the file does not exist, you may need to create it or configure it using the KDE System Settings.
     - Add or modify the following lines under the `[General]` section:
       ```
       [General]
       Session=plasma.desktop
       ```
       This configuration ensures that KDE Plasma is used, and typically defaults to **X11** if available.

### Benefits of Switching to X11
- **Compatibility**: X11 has better compatibility with older software and tools that might not yet fully support Wayland. Some software features, like advanced **screen capture**, **display manipulation**, and **input control**, work more reliably under X11.
- **More Mature Toolset**: Many system tools, like `xset`, **X11 forwarding**, or **xrandr**, are specifically designed for X11 and are widely supported.
  
### Drawbacks Compared to Wayland
- **Security**: Wayland offers better security compared to X11, especially regarding **input handling**. In X11, applications can easily interact with each other's windows, which can be a security risk.
- **Performance**: Wayland is designed to offer better **performance**, smoother frame rates, and reduced screen tearing, particularly with newer hardware.

### Switching Back to Wayland
If you wish to switch back to Wayland in the future:
- Log out of your session.
- On the login screen, select **"Plasma (Wayland)"** from the session menu, and then log in.

This way, you have the flexibility to switch between **X11** and **Wayland** depending on your needs and the specific tools you want to use.
