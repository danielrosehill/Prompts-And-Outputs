Yes, there are a few simple ways to check whether you're currently using Wayland or X11:

### 1. **Using `echo $XDG_SESSION_TYPE` (Terminal Method)**
   - Open a terminal and run the following command:
     ```
     echo $XDG_SESSION_TYPE
     ```
   - If the output is `x11`, you're using X11. If it says `wayland`, you're using Wayland.

### 2. **Using `loginctl` (Terminal Method)**
   - You can also use `loginctl` to check your session type:
     ```
     loginctl show-session $(loginctl | grep $(whoami) | awk '{print $1}') -p Type
     ```
   - This command will return `Type=x11` if you're using X11 or `Type=wayland` if you're on Wayland.

### 3. **System Settings in KDE Plasma**
   - In KDE Plasma, you can go to **System Settings** > **About this System** (or **Info Center**) to see information about your display server. It will show whether Wayland or X11 is in use.

These methods will give you a quick answer about which display server protocol youâ€™re currently running.
