**Summary:** You are asking about human sleep patterns before the widespread use of artificial lighting.

### Human Sleep Patterns Before Artificial Lighting

Before the advent of artificial lighting, especially electric lights, human sleep patterns were closely tied to natural light cycles. Here's how sleep used to work:

### 1. **Biphasic Sleep (Segmented Sleep)**
   - **Common Practice**: Historically, many humans followed a **biphasic sleep pattern**, which means they slept in two segments rather than one long stretch.
   - **Pattern**:
     - **First Sleep**: People would go to bed shortly after sunset and sleep for a few hours, typically waking up around midnight.
     - **Wake Period**: After waking, they would stay up for 1-2 hours. During this period, people might **pray, read, have conversations, engage in quiet activities**, or even visit neighbors.
     - **Second Sleep**: They would then go back to sleep until dawn or shortly before sunrise.
   - **Evidence**: Historical texts, literature, and diaries from the pre-industrial period mention terms like "first sleep" and "second sleep," suggesting that this segmented sleep pattern was quite common.

### 2. **Sleep Driven by Natural Light**
   - **Sunset to Sunrise**: Sleep schedules were largely dictated by **sunset and sunrise**. Without artificial light to extend productive hours, people often went to bed not long after dusk and woke up with the rising sun.
   - **Seasonal Variations**: Sleep duration varied with the seasons:
     - **Longer nights in winter**: People would sleep more, as nights were longer.
     - **Shorter nights in summer**: Sleep would be less, as there were more daylight hours.

### 3. **Sleep in Agricultural Societies**
   - **Early to Bed, Early to Rise**: In agricultural societies, it was typical to **go to bed early** and **wake up early**, as farmers needed to make the most of daylight for work.
   - **Practicality Over Comfort**: People’s schedules revolved around farm tasks, which meant waking up at dawn to begin chores and work outside, so sleep had to fit around these natural cycles.

### 4. **The Influence of Candles and Hearth Fires**
   - **Limited Nighttime Activity**: Before widespread electricity, people used **candles, oil lamps, and hearth fires** for light. These were not as bright or convenient as modern lighting, so they were used sparingly.
   - **Cost and Efficiency**: Candles and oil lamps were expensive, so many people opted to follow natural light cues instead of staying up late.

### 5. **Cultural and Historical References**
   - **Historical Evidence**: Anthropological studies of pre-industrial societies, as well as writings from the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, indicate that biphasic sleep was normal:
     - **Medieval Texts**: Books, diaries, and medical texts from these periods often mention “first sleep” and “second sleep.”
     - **Diaries and Personal Accounts**: Individuals wrote about waking up for a couple of hours in the middle of the night to pray, meditate, or perform quiet tasks.
   - **Examples from Other Cultures**: Some **hunter-gatherer societies** that still exist today follow similar patterns, sleeping in shifts or taking naps during the day, further supporting the idea that segmented sleep might be more "natural" for humans.

### 6. **Shift to Monophasic Sleep**
   - **Industrial Revolution Impact**: The shift towards a single long period of sleep (monophasic sleep) became more prevalent after the **Industrial Revolution**, as artificial lighting allowed people to stay awake longer and work into the night.
   - **Electric Light**: The introduction of affordable electric light bulbs in the late 19th and early 20th centuries made it easy for people to work or engage in leisure activities late into the evening, pushing back bedtime and encouraging a single, continuous block of sleep.

### Summary:
- **Biphasic Sleep**: Before artificial lighting, humans often slept in two segments — "first sleep" after sunset, a wakeful period around midnight, followed by "second sleep" until dawn.
- **Natural Light Dependency**: Sleep schedules were governed by the rise and fall of the sun, with longer sleep durations in winter.
- **Shift After Industrialization**: The Industrial Revolution and electric lighting led to the modern habit of monophasic (single-block) sleep.

Understanding pre-industrial sleep patterns suggests that our modern, continuous sleep might not align with the more flexible, segmented sleep rhythms humans naturally adapted to over millennia.
