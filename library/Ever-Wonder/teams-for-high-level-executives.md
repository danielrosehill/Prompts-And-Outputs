It's becoming increasingly common for high-level executives, especially CEOs of large companies and organizations, to have personal teams that help manage their work and personal responsibilities. These teams are designed to maximize the executive’s efficiency, handle various tasks, and allow the executive to focus on strategic decision-making.

A Chief of Staff (CoS) role is one of the key positions on such a team, often functioning as the executive’s right hand. The CoS coordinates communication, oversees special projects, and ensures alignment between the executive and various departments or external stakeholders.

How common is it?

Corporations and large organizations: It's fairly common, particularly in large companies, banks, tech firms, and startups. Many CEOs, especially in complex organizations, rely on a dedicated team to handle both work-related and sometimes personal tasks.

Private individuals: For high-profile individuals such as entrepreneurs, investors, or influential figures in business and tech, the role is also seen. It's particularly prevalent in sectors where the CEO is responsible for multiple ventures or has a public profile that requires media and external relations management.


Typical members of an executive's team:

1. Chief of Staff (CoS): Oversees the team, manages schedules, special projects, and high-level communications.


2. Executive Assistants (EA): Handle daily administrative tasks like scheduling, travel arrangements, meeting logistics, and correspondence.


3. Communications/Public Relations Specialist: Helps manage the executive’s public profile, media interactions, and internal communication strategies.


4. Strategic Advisor: Provides high-level strategic advice on business decisions and market opportunities.


5. Personal Assistant (PA): Manages more personal tasks such as home organization, travel planning for family, and sometimes even finances or logistics related to personal life.


6. Security Detail: In some cases, especially with high-profile CEOs, a security team or advisor is part of the setup.


7. Project Managers: Dedicated to handling specific business projects or initiatives under the CEO's directive.



Team size:

For large CEOs or those with highly complex roles, teams can be anywhere from 3 to 10 individuals or even more, depending on the demands of their job and the scope of their responsibilities.

These teams help ensure that the executive can focus on high-level decision-making and strategy while delegating other responsibilities to trusted team members.
