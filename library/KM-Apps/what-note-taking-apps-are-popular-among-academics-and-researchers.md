# Prompt

I can imagine that knowledge management research and note taking apps must be popular among academics and researchers. I use Fedora Linux. Can you think of any tools that are particularly popular among this userbase? Consider SaaS / cloud-delivered applications too. I'm looking for a very robust and scalable tool for taking and organising my notes and research findings, including my work with LLMs

# Output

Based on your requirements for a robust and scalable knowledge management tool for research and note-taking on Fedora Linux, here are some popular options to consider:

1. Zotero: A free, open-source reference management software designed specifically for researchers[2]. It allows you to collect, organize, cite, and share research materials.

2. Joplin: An open-source note-taking and to-do application that supports markdown formatting and synchronization across devices[12]. It's popular among Linux users and researchers.

3. Obsidian: A powerful knowledge base that works on top of a local folder of plain text Markdown files[8]. While not open-source, it has a strong following among academics and researchers.

4. Logseq: An open-source platform for knowledge management and collaboration[9]. It supports local-first storage and offers features like outlining and bidirectional linking.

5. Trilium Notes: An open-source, hierarchical note-taking application with a focus on building personal knowledge bases[4]. It offers advanced features like scripting and note linking.

6. Tiddlywiki: A unique, non-linear notebook for capturing, organizing, and sharing complex information[6]. It's highly customizable and can be used as a personal wiki.

7. Standard Notes: A free, open-source, and completely encrypted notes app that works across multiple platforms[8].

8. Notion: While not open-source, Notion is a popular cloud-based workspace that offers powerful organization and collaboration features[9]. It's widely used in academic and research settings.

9. Roam Research: A web-based tool for networked thought, popular among researchers for its bidirectional linking and graph view[9].

10. Evernote: A well-established note-taking app with robust features for organizing research materials[10]. While not open-source, it offers a Linux beta version.

For working with LLMs specifically, tools like Obsidian and Logseq have plugins or integrations that can enhance your workflow. Additionally, cloud-based tools like Notion are continually adding AI-powered features that could be beneficial for your research work with LLMs.

Remember that the best tool will depend on your specific workflow and preferences. Many of these applications offer free trials or versions, so you can experiment to find the one that fits your needs best.
