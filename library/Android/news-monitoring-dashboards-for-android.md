# Prompt

I'm trying to find a way to create a news monitoring dashboard that runs in "kiosk mode" on an Android device. I'm looking for updates from Israel in particular. Are there any apps that are designed to create something like this?

# Output

For creating a news monitoring dashboard in kiosk mode on an Android device, here are a few approaches that might work well, especially if you're focused on updates from Israel:

### 1. **Kiosk Browser & Wallboard Apps**
   - **Fully Kiosk Browser & App Lockdown**: This app is specifically designed to turn any Android device into a kiosk by locking it to a single app or webpage. You could configure it to load a custom dashboard, a website with Israel-specific news, or an RSS feed aggregator that refreshes periodically.
   - **Kiosk Browser**: Similar to Fully Kiosk Browser, this app allows you to load a specific webpage in full-screen mode. You could set it to open a site like Google News filtered for Israel or a custom news aggregator.

### 2. **News Aggregator Apps with Kiosk Mode**
   - **NewsTab**: This app lets you customize a news feed with RSS feeds and social media sources. Although it doesn't natively support kiosk mode, you could use it in combination with a kiosk app to lock the device to NewsTab.
   - **Inoreader**: This is an RSS feed reader that allows for significant customization. You can filter by specific topics, such as news from Israel. Similar to NewsTab, you could combine this with a kiosk app.

### 3. **Using a Customizable Dashboard App**
   - **MagicMirror²**: Although typically for smart mirrors, MagicMirror² can be used on Android devices. There are custom modules for news and RSS feeds, which you can set up for Israel-specific news. You would need to pair this with a kiosk app to lock the device into the dashboard mode.
   - **Dundas BI** or **Tableau Mobile**: These are business intelligence apps that allow you to create custom dashboards, including news feeds. They don't natively support kiosk mode, but you can use them in conjunction with a kiosk app.

Each of these can be tailored with news sources that provide updates from Israel, like Ynet, Haaretz, or Times of Israel, and be set to refresh automatically. Would any of these approaches fit your needs?
