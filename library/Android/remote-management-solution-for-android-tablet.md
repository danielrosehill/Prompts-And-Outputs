Can you suggest a method I can use to administer this tablet remotely? Ideally through the cloud and a free solution if possible. I'd like to leave it on all the time and be able to configure timings for kiosk mode browsers. I'd also like to be able to remotely install packages

For administering your Android tablet remotely via the cloud, ideally for free, while running **Fedora Linux** as your desktop, there are a few solutions that meet your requirements. These solutions allow for configuring kiosk mode schedules, keeping the tablet on all the time, and installing packages.

### **1. Scrcpy with ADB Over Network**
**Scrcpy** is an open-source tool that allows you to view and control Android devices from your Linux desktop via USB or over a network. Using **ADB over network**, you can establish a wireless connection, which makes it possible to control and administer the tablet remotely, including package installation.

- **Features**:
  - **Free and Open Source**: Works well with Fedora.
  - **Control Tablet**: Provides a real-time view of the tablet screen, and you can interact with it via keyboard and mouse.
  - **Remote Installation**: Use ADB commands through Scrcpy to install APKs and manage settings.
  
- **How to Set Up**:
  1. **Install Scrcpy** on Fedora:
     ```bash
     sudo dnf install scrcpy
     ```
  2. **Enable Developer Options** on your tablet and allow **USB debugging**.
  3. **Connect via USB** initially, and then switch to **ADB over WiFi**:
     ```bash
     adb tcpip 5555
     adb connect <tablet_ip>:5555
     scrcpy
     ```
  4. Use Scrcpy to interact with the device, and run ADB commands for package management:
     ```bash
     adb install your_app.apk
     ```
  
**Advantages**:
- Easy to set up and use.
- Full control over the device screen.
- Lightweight and minimal resource usage.

### **2. Home Assistant + Fully Kiosk Browser Integration**
Since you already have **Home Assistant** (HA) running, you can leverage **Fully Kiosk Browser** for remote administration.

- **Fully Kiosk Browser**:
  - Install **Fully Kiosk Browser** on the tablet. It offers remote administration capabilities, including turning the screen on/off, managing display settings, and controlling URL loads.
  - **Fully REST API** can be controlled via Home Assistant, allowing you to create automations for on/off scheduling and other kiosk settings.

- **How to Set Up**:
  1. **Install Fully Kiosk Browser** on the tablet.
  2. Enable **Remote Administration** (Settings > Remote Administration) in Fully Kiosk.
  3. Integrate Fully Kiosk into **Home Assistant** using the tablet's IP and admin password.
  4. From your **Fedora desktop**, you can access **Home Assistant** through the browser and manage kiosk scheduling and settings.

**Advantages**:
- Uses tools you already have (Home Assistant).
- Fully cloud-accessible and manageable.
- Automate kiosk timings, power settings, and more.

### **3. Termux with SSH Server**
**Termux** is a powerful Android app that provides a terminal environment, allowing you to run a variety of Linux commands. You can install an **SSH server** in Termux to remotely access and administer the tablet from your Fedora machine.

- **How to Set Up**:
  1. **Install Termux** from the Play Store.
  2. Set up **SSH** in Termux:
     ```bash
     pkg install openssh
     sshd
     ```
  3. Note the IP address of the tablet (you can use lightweight network tools like **Fing** or **IP Tools**).
  4. From your Fedora desktop, connect to the tablet:
     ```bash
     ssh user@<tablet_ip> -p 8022
     ```
  5. Remotely **install packages** via ADB commands or manage kiosk settings using Termux commands.

- **Automate Actions**:
  - You can also schedule specific commands to run at different times using **crontab** in Termux, allowing you to automatically turn the display on/off or load kiosk URLs.

**Advantages**:
- Free and lightweight.
- Offers full shell access for remote administration.
- Can automate actions using scripts and scheduling tools.

### **4. AirDroid Personal (Free Version)**
**AirDroid** provides cloud-based access and remote management for Android devices.

- **Features**:
  - **Remote Control**: Use the AirDroid web interface from your Fedora desktop to access and control the tablet remotely.
  - **File Management**: Upload APK files to the device for installation.
  - **Free Tier Limitations**: Data limits of 200MB/month for remote access, but it’s sufficient for basic admin needs.

- **How to Set Up**:
  1. Install **AirDroid** on the tablet.
  2. Create an **AirDroid account** and sign in on both the tablet and the web.
  3. Use the **AirDroid web client** to remotely manage the device, including package installations.

**Advantages**:
- User-friendly web interface.
- Free version allows basic control and package management.
- Ideal for less frequent administration.

### **Summary and Recommended Approach**:
- **Scrcpy with ADB Over Network**: Provides direct control and interaction with the tablet from your Fedora desktop, including remote installation of packages. It’s a great option if you prefer a lightweight and fast solution.
- **Home Assistant + Fully Kiosk Browser**: Perfect if you already use **Home Assistant**. It integrates well into your existing setup, allows automation of display settings, and controls kiosk browser timings.
- **Termux with SSH Server**: A command-line approach for remote access. It's lightweight and suitable if you are comfortable with Linux commands and want to keep everything open-source.
- **AirDroid Personal**: Provides a cloud-based option with a graphical interface, but with data limitations in the free version.

For full control and integration into your existing setup, the **Home Assistant + Fully Kiosk Browser** approach is likely the best fit for your needs, allowing you to automate and schedule kiosk settings effectively while administering the tablet remotely. **Scrcpy** is also a very handy tool for direct interaction with the device when needed.
