Yes, there are several Android apps that allow you to create encrypted vaults on your phone. These apps provide a secure way to store sensitive data like files, passwords, and notes. Here are a few popular ones:

1. VeraCrypt: VeraCrypt is a well-known cross-platform encryption tool. While it doesn’t have an official Android app, there are unofficial ports like E4A (Encryption for All), which support VeraCrypt volumes on Android devices.


2. Cryptomator: Cryptomator allows you to create encrypted vaults that can be synced with cloud storage services like Google Drive or Dropbox. It's easy to use and focuses on encrypting files before they are uploaded to the cloud.


3. KeePassDX: This is a password manager that supports encrypted vaults. While primarily for managing passwords, it also allows the storage of secure notes and files in encrypted form.


4. Andrognito: Andrognito is an app that allows you to hide and encrypt files on your Android device. It uses military-grade AES encryption to secure your files within a vault.


5. AxCrypt: AxCrypt offers file encryption with cloud integration. It supports encryption of files that can be stored locally or in the cloud, ensuring everything remains secure.


6. SafeFolderVault: This app lets you hide and encrypt photos, videos, and other files on your device. It’s simpler but works well for personal data vaults.

These apps offer varying degrees of encryption and functionality, depending on your needs. Cryptomator, in particular, is great if you want to sync with the cloud, while KeePassDX is ideal for managing passwords alongside secure notes or files.
