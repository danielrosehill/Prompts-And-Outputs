To address the issue of losing markdown formatting when pasting text into Obsidian on Android, here are a few possible solutions and workarounds:

1. Check the Editor Settings

Live Preview Mode: Ensure you are in Live Preview Mode (or Edit Mode). If you're in Reading Mode, pasting text might not trigger markdown auto-formatting.

Go to Settings → Editor → Editor Modes and make sure you’re using Live Preview.



2. Paste as Plain Text

Sometimes, text copied from certain apps (like browsers or Word processors) includes hidden formatting that can interfere with markdown.

Workaround: You can try pasting as plain text by long-pressing where you want to paste, then choosing Paste as Plain Text. This will strip any unwanted formatting but still allow markdown to be applied.


3. Third-Party Clipboard Apps

If the issue persists, using a clipboard manager app like Clipper or Clipboard Manager might help. These apps can help ensure that text is pasted without any interfering rich-text formatting, allowing markdown to take effect.


4. Check for Plugins or Updates

If you’re using any community plugins that affect editing, try disabling them temporarily to see if that resolves the issue.

Also, ensure that you have the latest version of Obsidian for Android installed, as updates may include fixes for clipboard and formatting issues.


5. Manually Apply Markdown After Pasting

As a temporary workaround, you can paste the text and manually apply markdown syntax afterward (e.g., add ** for bold, # for headings, etc.).


These steps should help restore markdown formatting when pasting text into Obsidian on Android. If the issue persists, it might be worth reporting it as a bug to the Obsidian developers.
