To estimate the storage size you'll need for future growth, let's break it down:

Current vault size: 50 MB for 3,000 notes.

Growth rate: 3,000 notes over 6 weeks.

Projected growth: You are accumulating roughly 500 notes per week.


At this rate, in a year (52 weeks), you would have:

500 notes/week × 52 weeks = 26,000 notes/year.


Assuming the size scales linearly:

50 MB / 3,000 notes = ~0.0167 MB/note.

Projected size for 26,000 notes: 26,000 × 0.0167 MB = ~434 MB/year.


Recommended Storage

Since Obsidian data primarily consists of text, and you've mentioned using 50 MB for 3,000 notes, text-based files don't take up much space. Even over several years, it's unlikely that the vault would take up more than a few gigabytes.

To future-proof yourself:

If you plan to keep up the same pace for 5 years: 434 MB/year × 5 years = ~2.2 GB.

Add extra space for attachments (if you plan to include images, PDFs, etc.), syncing, and general app use.


Conclusion:

A device with at least 128 GB of total storage should be more than enough, leaving ample room for Obsidian's growth alongside other apps and files. Even a device with 64 GB could be sufficient if you keep Obsidian as text-based and minimize large attachments.

If you plan to include a significant number of attachments, you might consider devices with 256 GB or expandable storage via microSD cards.
