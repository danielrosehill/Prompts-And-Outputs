Here are some **Android apps** that can **enforce dark mode** on your system or specific apps, enhancing your dark theme experience:

### 1. **Dark Mode App**
   - This lightweight app forces dark mode across all apps and the system interface.
   - It allows you to toggle between **light**, **dark**, and **auto** modes to match the time of day.
   - **Features**:
     - Simple interface for enabling dark mode.
     - Works well on devices that don't natively support system-wide dark mode.
   - **Download**: Available on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=systems.maju.darkmode)

### 2. **DarQ (For Rooted Devices)**
   - **DarQ** allows you to apply **per-app forced dark mode** on Android 10 and above. It provides more granular control by letting you choose which apps will use dark mode, even if they don't officially support it.
   - **Features**:
     - Per-app dark mode enforcement.
