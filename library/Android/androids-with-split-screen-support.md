Summary: You mentioned that your Samsung A23 doesn't seem to support split-screen mode, and you’re asking about Android devices that natively support this feature or have a second screen that can be pulled out.

Devices with Native Split-Screen Support

1. Samsung Galaxy Series:

Many Samsung Galaxy devices, especially from the S series and Note series, natively support split-screen multitasking. Models like the Galaxy S21, S22, S23, and Note 20 can easily switch to split-screen mode.



2. Google Pixel Devices:

Google Pixel phones (like Pixel 5, 6, and 7) also support split-screen mode natively. You can enable it from the app switcher.



3. OnePlus Devices:

OnePlus models (like the OnePlus 8, 9, and 10 series) come with split-screen functionality.



4. Xiaomi and POCO Devices:

Many Xiaomi and POCO smartphones support split-screen multitasking. You can check the specific model for availability.




Devices with Dual Screens

1. LG V60 ThinQ:

The LG V60 can be paired with a dual-screen accessory that provides a second screen. This accessory allows for extended multitasking capabilities.



2. Asus ROG Phone Series:

The Asus ROG Phone series offers optional accessories like the TwinView Dock, which adds a second screen for gaming or multitasking.



3. Microsoft Surface Duo:

The Surface Duo features dual screens that can be used for multitasking, allowing you to run two apps side by side.



4. Samsung Galaxy Z Fold Series:

The Galaxy Z Fold 3 and 4 have a large foldable screen that can be used in split-screen mode, making multitasking easy and intuitive.




Considerations

Software Version: Make sure your device’s software is updated, as some features may improve with newer Android versions.

App Compatibility: Not all apps support split-screen mode, so even if your device supports it, certain apps may not function as expected in that mode.


If multitasking is a priority for you, consider looking into devices specifically designed with that capability in mind, especially those with larger displays or dual screens.
