Yes, many file managers can show hidden files and other items that might be contributing to the unexpectedly high file count in your vault folder. Here are a few options you can try on Android:

1. Solid Explorer (Recommended)

Steps:

1. Install Solid Explorer from the Play Store.


2. Open the app, navigate to your vault folder.


3. Tap on the three-dot menu in the top right corner.


4. Select Show hidden files (it may be labeled as “Show system files” depending on the version).


5. You can now see any hidden files or folders that might be contributing to the file count.

2. FX File Explorer

Steps:

1. Install FX File Explorer from the Play Store.

2. Open the app and navigate to your vault folder.
3. Tap the menu icon (three lines) in the top left corner.
4. Scroll down and toggle Hidden Files on to view hidden files and folders.

3. MiXplorer

Steps:

1. Download MiXplorer from trusted sources like XDA Labs.

2. Open MiXplorer and navigate to the vault folder.

3. In the top-right corner, tap on the three-dot menu and enable Show hidden files.

4. MiXplorer is also capable of scanning for large files, orphan files, or system files that may have ended up in the folder.

By using any of these file managers, you'll be able to inspect any hidden files or system-related items that may have been included in the file count, and you can decide what can safely be removed or ignored.
