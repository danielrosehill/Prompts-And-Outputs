Summary of your prompt: You asked which Android devices have the best support for screen splitting and whether any have pull-out second displays.

Many high-end Android devices support screen splitting, but devices with larger screens or foldable designs offer the best experiences. Here's a list of devices with excellent screen-splitting support and those with dual or secondary displays:

Devices with Best Support for Screen Splitting:

1. Samsung Galaxy Z Fold Series (Z Fold 5, Z Fold 4, etc.):

Excellent for multitasking due to the large foldable display.

Samsung's One UI includes great multitasking features like drag-and-drop functionality and customizable split-screen options.



2. Google Pixel Fold:

Google's foldable phone has a large screen that supports efficient multitasking with its split-screen mode.



3. Samsung Galaxy Tab Series (Tab S9, Tab S8, etc.):

Larger tablets provide an enhanced multitasking experience with multiple apps open simultaneously.

Samsung Dex adds even more functionality for desktop-like multitasking.



4. Microsoft Surface Duo 2:

Features two separate screens connected by a hinge, making multitasking smooth across two displays.

Optimized for dual-app use and offers unique split-screen modes.



5. LG Velvet and LG V60 ThinQ (with Dual Screen Accessory):

These devices support a dual-screen accessory that attaches to the phone, providing a second display for extended multitasking. LG has since exited the smartphone market, but the V60 still has strong multitasking capabilities.




Pull-Out or Secondary Displays:

LG Dual Screen Accessory: As mentioned above, LG's now-discontinued models like the LG Velvet and LG V60 ThinQ offer a dual-screen case accessory that allows users to pull out and use a second display.

Asus ROG Phone Series: Some models have a second display through the ROG TwinView Dock accessory, providing additional screen real estate for gaming and multitasking.


Currently, no mainstream Android device has a true "pull-out" or retractable second display built directly into the phone itself, but foldable and dual-screen devices offer the closest functionality for multitasking.
