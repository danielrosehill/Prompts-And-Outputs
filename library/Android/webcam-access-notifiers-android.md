For Fedora Linux, here are a few solutions that can monitor and notify you if your webcam or microphone are being accessed:

1. Howdy (Linux Webcam Notifier)

Description: While originally designed for facial recognition login, Howdy provides detailed logs of when your webcam is accessed. It doesn't directly notify you, but with some scripting, you could create a notification system that alerts you to webcam usage.

Installation: Available in Fedora repositories.

Customization: You can combine it with tools like notify-send to create real-time notifications.


2. Webcam Indicator Script

Description: A custom solution that you can set up using a bash script to monitor /dev/video0, which corresponds to your webcam. It checks when the device is in use and triggers a notification.

Implementation:

Use udev rules to monitor the webcam and microphone.

Combine with notify-send for real-time desktop notifications.



3. MicTray

Description: This small tool allows you to see when the microphone is being accessed. It’s minimalistic but effective at showing the microphone state. You can combine it with a visual notification tool like dunst.


4. Privacy Indicator (Gnome Extension)

Description: If you are using Gnome on Fedora, this extension shows an indicator whenever the webcam or microphone is active. It’s a simple visual notification right on your system tray.

Installation: You can install this from the Gnome Extensions website by searching for Privacy Indicator.


5. Cheese (for webcam testing)

Description: Although not a notifier, Cheese is a webcam tool that can help you check if the webcam is active or being accessed. It’s a simple tool to see whether the webcam is working but doesn't offer ongoing monitoring.


For a Fedora-specific setup, a combination of Howdy, udev rules, and notify-send is a good custom solution to get notifications for both webcam and microphone access.
