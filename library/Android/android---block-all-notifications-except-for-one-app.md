# Prompt

are there any tools for android that can be used to block all notifications except those that would come from one specific app?

# Output

Yes, there are a few ways to configure your Android device to allow notifications only from a specific app, effectively blocking all other notifications. Here are some tools and methods to achieve this:

### 1. **Do Not Disturb (DND) Mode**
Most Android devices have a built-in Do Not Disturb mode that allows you to block all notifications except from specific apps or contacts:
   - Go to **Settings > Sound > Do Not Disturb** (or a similar path, depending on your device).
   - Choose **Exceptions** or **Allow exceptions**, then select the app you want to allow notifications from. Depending on your device, this may be listed under **Apps** or **Priority only allows**.
   - Enable **Do Not Disturb** mode, and you should only receive notifications from the chosen app.

### 2. **Notification Manager Apps**
Apps like **Tasker** and **MacroDroid** allow for advanced automation, including notification management:
   - **Tasker**: With Tasker, you can create a profile that automatically blocks all notifications except from specific apps. This requires setting up custom rules and may need some configuration.
   - **MacroDroid**: Similar to Tasker, MacroDroid lets you set up specific conditions and actions. You can configure it to turn on Do Not Disturb mode while enabling notifications for a single app.

### 3. **Focus Mode (Digital Wellbeing)**
   - If your device supports Digital Wellbeing, you can use **Focus Mode** to block notifications from all apps except the one you need.
   - Go to **Settings > Digital Wellbeing & parental controls > Focus mode**.
   - Choose **Set up** and select the apps you want to block. Then, exclude the app you want notifications from. When you enable Focus Mode, notifications from all other apps will be blocked.

### 4. **Third-Party Notification Blocker Apps**
Some third-party apps focus specifically on managing notifications:
   - **FilterBox**: FilterBox allows you to create custom notification rules, where you can mute or allow notifications based on the app.
   - **Notification Blocker**: This app lets you block notifications from specific apps while allowing others. Configure it to only allow the notifications you need.
