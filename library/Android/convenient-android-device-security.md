Here are some ways to secure your Android device without making it too inconvenient:

1. Smart Lock: Use Android’s Smart Lock feature to keep your phone unlocked in trusted situations, such as when it's near a trusted device (e.g., your smartwatch), in a trusted location (like home), or when it's on your person.


2. Fingerprint Scanner: If your phone has a fingerprint scanner, this can provide a secure but quick method to unlock the device without relying on a PIN or facial recognition.


3. App Lockers: Instead of locking the whole phone, you can use app lockers to secure individual apps, allowing you to access less sensitive areas of the phone without needing to constantly unlock it.


4. Shorter Lock Timeout: Adjust your screen timeout to allow a longer duration before it locks, so you don't have to unlock it every time you pick it up after a short pause.


5. Notification Lockdown: Secure your notifications by hiding sensitive information on the lock screen, allowing you to still see general notifications without needing to unlock the phone fully.


6. Biometric Bypass for Specific Apps: Some apps offer the option to stay logged in using biometrics like fingerprints, so you won’t need to enter your PIN or password repeatedly.


7. VPN and Encrypted Storage: If data security is a priority, consider using a VPN for secure connections and enabling encrypted storage on your device, adding layers of security without affecting daily use too much.
