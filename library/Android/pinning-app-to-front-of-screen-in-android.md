# Prompt

Is there an Android app that would allow me to pin an app to the front of the screen in such a way that it was constantly visible even when other apps were open behind it?

# Output
To pin an app to the front of your screen on Android, allowing it to remain visible even when other apps are open, you can use the built-in **App Pinning** feature:

1. **Enable App Pinning**:
   - Go to **Settings** > **Security** > **App Pinning** (this may vary slightly based on your device).
   - Toggle the setting to **On**.

2. **Pin the App**:
   - Open the app you want to pin.
   - Access the **Recent Apps** view.
   - Tap the app's icon and select **Pin**. 

To unpin, swipe up and authenticate with your PIN or fingerprint.

For a more persistent solution, third-party apps like **Floating Apps** or **Overlays** can help create a floating window for the app, ensuring it stays visible on top of other applications.
