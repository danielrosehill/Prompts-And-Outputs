Yes, there are both software and physical solutions to ensure your device's cameras are protected from unauthorized access, especially the selfie camera.

1. Software Solutions (Apps)

Camera Blocker Apps: These apps disable access to your device's camera entirely and can notify you if an app tries to access it.

Camera Blocker: This app blocks access to all cameras on your phone and provides real-time alerts when any app tries to use the camera.

Access Dots: It doesnâ€™t block the camera but shows an indicator whenever the camera or microphone is in use by any app.

App Ops: This app provides fine-tuned control over app permissions, allowing you to revoke camera access for specific apps.



You can use these apps to ensure only the apps you trust have access to your camera, and you can completely disable camera access when you don't need it.

2. Physical Solutions (Camera Covers)

Physical Camera Covers: These are small stickers or sliders that cover your front (selfie) camera when not in use. Many are designed to be easily opened or closed, allowing you to block the camera physically.

Webcam Cover Sliders: You can buy small adhesive sliders that stick over your selfie camera. They have a sliding mechanism so you can cover or uncover the camera as needed.

Amazon and online retailers have various types of these sliders, often sold in packs for multiple devices.



These physical covers are a simple and effective way to ensure your camera isn't accessed without your knowledge.

Recommendation:

For maximum security: Use a combination of a physical slider cover for your selfie camera and a camera-blocking app to monitor and control camera access.
