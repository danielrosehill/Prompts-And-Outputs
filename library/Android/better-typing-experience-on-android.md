Summary of your prompt: You find typing on an Android phone awkward and are looking for tools to make it easier.

There are several tools and techniques that can help improve typing on Android phones:

1. Alternative Keyboards:

Gboard: Google's keyboard offers features like swipe typing (Glide Typing), voice typing, and predictive text to make typing faster and easier. It also supports custom layouts and resizing of the keyboard.

SwiftKey: This is another popular keyboard with advanced autocorrect and swipe typing. It adapts to your typing style and offers personalized suggestions.

Fleksy: A customizable keyboard known for its fast typing experience and gesture-based controls.

Typewise: A hexagonal keyboard that claims to reduce typos by offering larger keys and auto-correction tailored to your typing style.



2. Voice Typing: Many Android keyboards, including Gboard and SwiftKey, support voice typing, which can reduce the need to physically type. You can activate this by tapping the microphone icon and speaking your text.


3. Stylus Input: If you find typing on a touchscreen difficult, using a stylus might offer more precision. Some phones, like Samsung's Galaxy Note series, come with built-in stylus support, but there are third-party stylus options available for any Android phone.


4. Split Keyboard: Some keyboard apps, including Gboard, support split layouts, which can make typing with two thumbs more comfortable, especially on larger phones.


5. Custom Shortcuts: You can set up text shortcuts for commonly used phrases or words to reduce typing effort. Most keyboards support this feature.


6. External Keyboards: You can connect a Bluetooth or USB-C keyboard to your phone for a more traditional typing experience. Some compact foldable Bluetooth keyboards are designed specifically for mobile use.


7. Handwriting Input: If typing feels awkward, you can try handwriting input (available on Gboard and other keyboards), which lets you write out words that the phone converts into text.



By experimenting with these tools, you can find an approach that works better for you!
