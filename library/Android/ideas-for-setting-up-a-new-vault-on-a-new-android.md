Setting up Obsidian on a **new Android device** can be a bit more involved compared to desktop environments due to the mobile-specific nuances of installing apps and managing plugins, as well as syncing files. However, there are ways to streamline the process to minimize the effort required for future setups, especially around syncing your vault and restoring configurations and plugins.

Here’s a step-by-step guide and a few ideas to make the process easier:

### 1. **Install Obsidian on Android**
   First, download and install Obsidian from the **Google Play Store**.

   - **Manual Installation**: Search for Obsidian on the Play Store and install it directly.
   - **Alternative Option**: If you prefer not to use Google Play or want the APK for another reason, you can download the APK directly from Obsidian’s [official website](https://obsidian.md/download).

### 2. **Syncing Your Vault on Android**
   You’re already using **Backblaze B2** for sync, which isn't natively supported by Obsidian’s Android app. However, there are several ways to set up syncing for your vault on Android using tools like **rclone** or other cloud sync apps.

#### Option 1: **Use rclone to Sync with B2**
   You can use **rclone** to mount your B2 bucket as a local folder on your Android device and sync it with the Obsidian vault.

   ##### Steps:
   1. **Install Termux**: Download **Termux** from the Play Store, which gives you a terminal environment on Android.
   
   2. **Install rclone** in Termux:
      ```bash
      pkg install rclone
      ```

   3. **Configure rclone** to connect to Backblaze B2:
      ```bash
      rclone config
      ```
      - Follow the prompts to add your Backblaze B2 credentials.
      - Create a remote that points to your B2 bucket.

   4. **Mount the B2 Bucket** to a Local Directory:
      - You can mount the bucket to a folder on your Android device where Obsidian stores its vaults.
      - Use the `rclone mount` command to mount the B2 bucket to the `/storage/emulated/0/Documents/ObsidianVault` directory.

   5. **Set up Periodic Sync** (Optional):
      - Set up `rclone sync` in **Termux** to periodically sync your vault from B2, ensuring you always have the latest version.

   ##### Pros:
   - Full control over your sync process, works with Backblaze B2.
   - Can automate the sync process with Termux.

   ##### Cons:
   - Requires some setup in Termux.
   - More manual than using native sync services.

#### Option 2: **Use FolderSync App**
   **FolderSync** is an Android app that supports syncing folders with many cloud providers, including Backblaze B2. You can configure it to sync your Obsidian vault with B2 automatically or on demand.

   ##### Steps:
   1. **Install FolderSync** from the Play Store.
   
   2. **Set up a Sync Profile**:
      - Add a sync profile that connects to Backblaze B2 using your account credentials.
      - Set up FolderSync to sync your vault with the **/storage/emulated/0/Documents/ObsidianVault** folder (or wherever you want your vault to be stored).

   3. **Configure Sync Settings**:
      - You can configure FolderSync to sync automatically at certain intervals, when connected to Wi-Fi, or manually on demand.
      - Set it to "one-way sync" from B2 to Android (if you want to pull updates from B2 without pushing changes) or "two-way sync" if you want to sync changes in both directions.

   ##### Pros:
   - No command-line tools needed.
   - Easy setup with a user-friendly interface.
   - Works with Backblaze B2.

   ##### Cons:
   - Requires using a third-party app.
   - FolderSync’s more advanced features are in the paid version.

#### Option 3: **Use Google Drive or Dropbox Instead of B2**
   If you are open to switching from B2 to a service that has more native Android support, consider using **Google Drive** or **Dropbox**. Both services have strong Android integration and can automatically sync files across devices, including your Obsidian vault.

   - Use Obsidian’s **own sync settings** if you go with **Dropbox** or **Google Drive**.
   - Obsidian supports the use of a "third-party sync app" to sync vaults across devices. You can sync your vault via Google Drive/Dropbox, and it will be automatically recognized by Obsidian’s file management system.

   ##### Pros:
   - Native support for cloud syncing services with Android apps.
   - Very easy to set up and maintain with minimal ongoing effort.

   ##### Cons:
   - May require migrating your vault from B2 to Google Drive or Dropbox.

### 3. **Automate Plugin Installation and Settings Sync**
   On Android, Obsidian does not automatically sync your plugin configurations, so you need to transfer them from your old setup. However, you can automate this process to avoid having to reinstall plugins and reconfigure them each time you set up a new device.

#### Steps for Automating Plugin Setup:
   1. **Backup Your Plugin Settings**:
      - In your old vault, back up the `.obsidian` folder, which contains your plugin configurations, themes, and settings.
      - You can store this folder in B2 or another location.

   2. **Transfer Plugin Settings** to New Android Device:
      - When you set up Obsidian on your new Android device, you can copy the `.obsidian` folder to your vault location (using FolderSync or rclone).
      - This will restore all your plugins and settings in one go.

   3. **Automate the Process with a Script**:
      - You can create a **script in Termux** that downloads the `.obsidian` folder from B2 (or another cloud service) and places it in the correct location, automating the process each time you set up a new device.
      ```bash
      rclone copy b2remote:your-b2-bucket-name/.obsidian /storage/emulated/0/Documents/ObsidianVault/.obsidian
      ```

### 4. **Restore Themes and Customizations**
   If you use specific **themes** or **custom CSS** in Obsidian, you can back up the `.obsidian/themes` folder and copy it over to new Android devices in the same way you handle plugins.

#### Steps:
   - Sync or manually copy the `.obsidian/themes` folder to your Android device's vault directory, using `rclone` or **FolderSync**.
   - Your custom themes will automatically appear in Obsidian when you restart the app.

### 5. **General Tips for Making Future Setups Easier**
   - **Store Configurations in Cloud**: Keep your Obsidian settings, plugins, and themes backed up to B2 or another cloud storage solution. Whenever you set up a new device, you can just pull these files down rather than reconfigure everything.
   - **Automate Syncing**: Use **FolderSync** or **rclone** to automate the sync process, ensuring that the latest version of your vault is always available on any device without manual intervention.
   - **Backup Settings Periodically**: Make sure your `.obsidian` folder is regularly backed up to your cloud storage solution to ensure you always have the latest version of your settings and plugins available for new setups.

### Conclusion
To make setting up Obsidian on a **new Android device** easier, you can automate several steps:
- Use **FolderSync** or **rclone** with **Termux** to automate syncing your vault from Backblaze B2.
- Backup and restore your plugin settings and themes by copying the `.obsidian` folder.
- Use automation scripts to pull configurations from the cloud and apply them to your new device.
- Consider switching to **Google Drive** or **Dropbox** if you need even easier syncing, though B2 is still a good option for those who prefer a more flexible, self-managed sync system.
