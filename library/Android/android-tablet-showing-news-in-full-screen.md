# Prompt

I have a news dashboard link accessible from Chrome (or any browser). I'd like to leave it open in full screen on my Android tablet for round the clock display. Ideally in full screen without elements like the address bar etc displaying. Best way to achieve this?

# Output

To display your news dashboard in **full screen** on your **Android tablet** without browser elements like the address bar, you can use several approaches:

### 1. **Use Chrome’s Full-Screen Mode (Add to Home Screen)**:
   - **Step 1**: Open the dashboard link in **Chrome**.
   - **Step 2**: Tap the **three-dot menu** in the upper right corner.
   - **Step 3**: Select **"Add to Home screen"**.
   - **Step 4**: Once added, you’ll see a shortcut on your home screen.
   - **Step 5**: Tap the shortcut to open the dashboard in full screen as a standalone app, without the address bar and other browser elements.

   This is essentially a **Progressive Web App (PWA)**, allowing the webpage to act like a native app in full-screen mode.

### 2. **Use a Dedicated Kiosk Mode App**:
   Kiosk mode apps allow you to lock your tablet into a single app or webpage, ideal for displaying content like a dashboard continuously.
   - **Fully Kiosk Browser**: This app is widely used for setting up Android devices in kiosk mode. It allows you to open a specific webpage in full screen and offers various settings like disabling navigation buttons.
     - Download from Google Play: [Fully Kiosk Browser](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.ozerov.fully)
   - **Kiosk Browser Lockdown**: Another option that allows full-screen display of a specific website and limits user interaction with the tablet.

### 3. **Use Chrome Flags for Full-Screen Mode**:
   You can enable immersive mode with Chrome flags to push the website further into full screen:
   - Open Chrome and type **`chrome://flags/`** in the address bar.
   - Search for **"Immersive Fullscreen Toolbar"**.
   - Enable it and relaunch Chrome. This should make the browser enter immersive mode more easily, removing the toolbar when interacting with the page.

### 4. **Enable Developer Options to Hide Navigation Buttons**:
   You can also hide the system navigation buttons (back, home, and recent apps) to make the display truly full screen:
   - Go to **Settings > About Tablet**.
   - Tap **Build Number** 7 times to unlock Developer Options.
   - In Developer Options, enable **"Immersive Mode"** or use third-party apps that enable immersive mode system-wide.

This setup ensures that your tablet remains in full screen, providing an uninterrupted view of your news dashboard.
