Yes, on Android, it's common to provide a single file containing both the certificate and the private key, often in a **PKCS#12 (.p12 or .pfx)** format, which is designed to store both the certificate and the private key in one file. You can easily combine your certificate and private key into a `.pem` file or convert them into a `.p12` file.

### Option 1: **Combine Certificate and Private Key into a Single PEM File**

If you want to combine the certificate and key into a single PEM file, you can simply concatenate the certificate and key files.

#### Steps:
1. Open a text editor or terminal.
2. Copy the certificate block (`-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- ... -----END CERTIFICATE-----`).
3. Copy the private key block (`-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY----- ... -----END PRIVATE KEY-----`).
4. Paste the private key first, followed by the certificate.

Example of the combined PEM file (`combined.pem`):
```
-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
xxxxxxxAmIwggJeAgEAAoIBAQCxf...
...
xxxxxxxHVjigk1Q==
-----END PRIVATE KEY-----

-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
xxxxxxxMIIBCgKCAQEArfXOP3qu1K9/M0zZVvn1
...
uDPzJ62OGlZ34v/xxxxxxx5Q==
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

#### How to Use:
You can try to install this `.pem` file on Android via **Settings > Security > Install from storage**, but note that Android might prefer `.p12/.pfx` format for storing both the key and certificate together.

### Option 2: **Convert Certificate and Key to a PKCS#12 (.p12) File**

The preferred format for installing both a certificate and private key on Android is **PKCS#12** (.p12). Hereâ€™s how to create a `.p12` file using OpenSSL:

#### Steps:
1. Ensure you have both the `certificate.pem` and `privatekey.pem` files ready.
2. Use OpenSSL to convert these into a `.p12` file:

```bash
openssl pkcs12 -export -out combined.p12 -inkey privatekey.pem -in certificate.pem -name "Your Cert Name"
```

- You will be prompted to set an **export password**. This password will protect the `.p12` file and will be required when you install it on Android.
- Replace `"Your Cert Name"` with a friendly name you want to assign to the certificate.

#### How to Install:
1. Transfer the `combined.p12` file to your Android device.
2. Install the certificate via **Settings > Security > Install from storage**.
3. Enter the password you set for the `.p12` file during installation.

### Conclusion:
The **PKCS#12 (.p12)** format is the most reliable way to combine the certificate and private key for Android devices. However, you can also try using a single `.pem` file if needed, but `.p12` is generally more accepted by Android for managing both the certificate and key together.
