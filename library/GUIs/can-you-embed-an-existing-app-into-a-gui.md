# Prompt

Obsidian doesn't have a web version. It's purely a desktop app. Is there any way to integrate an existing app into a custom GUI in the manner I'm thinking about?

# Output

Based on the information provided and the fact that Obsidian is a desktop app without a web version, integrating it into a custom GUI alongside a website is more challenging but still possible. Here are some approaches you could consider:

1. X11 Window Embedding:
On Linux systems like Fedora, you can use X11 window embedding to incorporate Obsidian into your custom application[1]. This technique allows you to embed one application's window into another.

```python
import gtk
import subprocess

# Create a main window
window = gtk.Window()
window.set_size_request(800, 600)

# Create a socket to embed Obsidian
socket = gtk.Socket()
window.add(socket)

# Launch Obsidian and get its window ID
obsidian_process = subprocess.Popen(["obsidian"])
window_id = socket.get_id()

# Embed Obsidian's window
subprocess.call(["xdotool", "windowreparent", str(window_id), str(socket.get_id())])

# Show the main window
window.show_all()

gtk.main()
```

This approach uses GTK and the XEMBED protocol to embed Obsidian's window into your custom application.

2. Custom Framework with WebView:
Create a custom application using a framework like PyQt5 or wxPython that includes both a native window for Obsidian and a WebView for your website[2].

```python
from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication, QMainWindow, QWidget, QHBoxLayout
from PyQt5.QtWebEngineWidgets import QWebEngineView
from PyQt5.QtCore import QUrl
import subprocess
import sys

class MainWindow(QMainWindow):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.setWindowTitle("Obsidian + Web")
        self.setGeometry(100, 100, 1200, 800)

        central_widget = QWidget()
        layout = QHBoxLayout()

        # Launch Obsidian
        subprocess.Popen(["obsidian"])

        # Create WebView for the website
        web_view = QWebEngineView()
        web_view.load(QUrl("https://example.com"))

        layout.addWidget(web_view)
        central_widget.setLayout(layout)
        self.setCentralWidget(central_widget)

app = QApplication(sys.argv)
window = MainWindow()
window.show()
sys.exit(app.exec_())
```

This script creates a PyQt5 window with a WebView for your website. It also launches Obsidian as a separate window, which you can manually position next to your custom app.

3. Electron-based Solution:
While Electron typically works with web technologies, you can use it to create a custom app that launches both Obsidian and embeds a website[3]. This approach would involve creating an Electron app that spawns Obsidian as a child process and includes a WebView for your website.

These solutions require some level of system integration and may not provide a completely seamless experience. The X11 window embedding approach is likely the closest to what you're envisioning, but it's specific to X11-based systems and may have limitations.

Remember that any solution involving embedding or manipulating Obsidian's window may be affected by changes to Obsidian's implementation or security measures in future updates. Always ensure you're complying with Obsidian's terms of service and licensing agreements when implementing such solutions.

# Solutions like this but for Wayland

Based on the search results and your query about Wayland compatibility, here are some solutions that should work well with Wayland for creating custom desktop applications or embedding websites:

1. Electron-based solutions:
Electron is compatible with Wayland and can be used to create custom desktop applications that embed websites. It's widely used and supports both X11 and Wayland[5].

2. WebCatalog:
This is a Chromium-based solution that allows you to create native-like applications from websites. It should work on Wayland as it's based on modern web technologies[5].

3. Nativefier:
Similar to WebCatalog, Nativefier is a command-line tool that creates desktop applications from websites. It uses Electron under the hood, so it should be compatible with Wayland[5].

4. GNOME Web (Epiphany):
This is a native GNOME application that allows you to create web apps. It's built with GTK and should work well with Wayland[5].

5. Tangram:
This is a GTK-based specialized web browser that allows you to pin multiple webapps into one native app GUI. Being GTK-based, it should have good compatibility with Wayland[5].

6. Custom Wayland Compositor:
For a more advanced and customized solution, you could create your own Wayland compositor. This would allow you to manage and position windows (including Obsidian and embedded websites) exactly as you want[1][3].

When considering Wayland compatibility, it's important to note that many modern Linux applications and frameworks are designed to work with both X11 and Wayland. The Electron-based solutions (like WebCatalog and Nativefier) and GTK-based solutions (like GNOME Web and Tangram) are likely to offer the best compatibility and integration with Wayland.

For your specific use case of combining Obsidian with an embedded website, an Electron-based solution might be the most flexible approach. You could create a custom Electron app that launches Obsidian as a child process and embeds your desired website, all within a Wayland-compatible window.

Remember that Wayland support can vary depending on the specific Linux distribution and desktop environment you're using, so some testing may be required to ensure full compatibility with your setup.
