Here are a few Fedora-compatible GUIs for reading and writing NFC data that you can use with your **ACR1252**:

### 1. **NFC Tools GUI**
   - A user-friendly tool for basic NFC reading and writing tasks.
   - Can handle tasks like reading tag information, writing URLs, and storing data.

### 2. **GoToTags Desktop**
   - A more comprehensive tool for managing NFC tags, supporting reading, writing, and encoding.
   - Useful for more advanced applications beyond simple reading/writing.

### 3. **LibNFC GUI (with `nfc-tools`)**
   - Requires some configuration but provides a graphical interface for basic NFC operations.
   - Combines the functionality of command-line `libnfc` utilities with a visual layer.

These tools help manage your NFC reader and tags with graphical interfaces, simplifying the process on Fedora.
