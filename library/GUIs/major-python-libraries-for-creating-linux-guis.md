# Prompt

Can you give me a run down of some of the major libraries for creating Python GUIs that are compatible on Linux computers? I run Fedora. I'm a beginner, but I'd like to keep my eyes on GUI creation tools that I can build with. I'd also love to find any solutions that allow you to preview your development visually

# Output

Here's a rundown of some major Python GUI libraries that are compatible with Linux, including Fedora:

1. Tkinter:
- Comes pre-installed with Python
- Simple and lightweight
- Good for beginners
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Limited visual appeal

2. PyQt/PySide:
- Powerful and feature-rich
- Cross-platform 
- Professional-looking interfaces
- Steeper learning curve
- Qt Designer provides visual GUI builder

3. wxPython:
- Native look and feel on different platforms
- Extensive widget set
- Good documentation
- wxGlade offers visual GUI design

4. Kivy:
- Modern and flexible
- Great for touch-based interfaces
- Cross-platform, including mobile
- Kivy Designer for visual development

5. GTK+ (PyGObject):
- Native look on GNOME/Linux systems
- Extensive widget library
- Glade interface designer for visual development

6. PySimpleGUI: 
- Simplifies GUI development
- Built on top of Tkinter, Qt, wxPython
- Good for beginners
- Limited visual design tools

7. Dear PyGui:
- Fast and lightweight
- Good for data visualization
- Cross-platform
- No built-in visual designer

For visual development, I'd recommend looking into:

- Qt Designer (for PyQt/PySide)
- Glade (for GTK+)
- wxGlade (for wxPython)
- Kivy Designer (for Kivy)

These tools allow you to visually design your GUI and preview it as you build. As a beginner, you might want to start with Tkinter for simplicity, then perhaps move to PyQt or wxPython as you advance for more powerful features and better visual design capabilities.
