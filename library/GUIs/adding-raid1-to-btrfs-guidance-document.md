# Prompt

Great. Please create another document. This one is just intended as a guide to the person who will be implementing the move to RAID1. Focus on just providing them with the required command. Add verbosity if possible. And give them a guide as to how to monitor the system and expected duration of the change given that the storage is about 250 GB

# Output

Here’s a concise guide that provides the required commands to implement the RAID1 conversion on a BTRFS array. This document includes verbosity options to monitor the progress and instructions for keeping track of system status throughout the process.

### Guide to Converting BTRFS Array to RAID1 with Verbose Monitoring

#### Prerequisites
Ensure you have `btrfs-progs` installed. If not, install it with:
```bash
sudo dnf install btrfs-progs
```

#### Step 1: Start RAID1 Conversion with Verbose Output
To convert the existing BTRFS array to RAID1 with verbose output, use:
```bash
sudo btrfs balance start -dconvert=raid1 -mconvert=raid1 -v -f /
```
- `-dconvert=raid1`: Converts data to RAID1.
- `-mconvert=raid1`: Converts metadata to RAID1.
- `-v`: Provides verbose output for detailed monitoring.
- `-f`: Forces conversion even if space is low.

#### Step 2: Monitor Conversion Progress
1. To monitor the progress in real-time, use:
   ```bash
   sudo btrfs balance status -v /
   ```
   - This command provides detailed information on the conversion status.
   - You can see the number of chunks processed and remaining.

2. Alternatively, to periodically check the status, re-run:
   ```bash
   sudo btrfs balance status /
   ```

#### Step 3: Estimated Duration
- Given approximately 250 GB of data, the conversion to RAID1 may take **30 minutes to 1 hour**, depending on drive speed and system load. During this time, it’s safe to continue using the system, though performance may be temporarily impacted.

#### Step 4: Verify RAID1 Configuration Post-Conversion
Once the balance operation completes, confirm the RAID1 configuration with:
```bash
sudo btrfs filesystem df /
```
This command will display the RAID profile for both data and metadata, confirming they are now in RAID1 mode.

### Additional Notes
- **Checking BTRFS Health:** Use `sudo btrfs device stats /` to monitor for any I/O errors during or after the conversion.
- **Log Monitoring:** To observe any system logs or errors, you can run `dmesg -w` during the operation.

This document should guide the implementation of the RAID1 conversion efficiently with essential commands and monitoring steps.
