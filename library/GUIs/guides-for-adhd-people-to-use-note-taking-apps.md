# Input

Are there any guides more generally on how people with ADHD and organisational issues can make use of note taking apps like Obsidian? I think it would really help me. But I don't think it makes sense to just focus on one platform.

# Output

Here are some general guides and insights on how people with **ADHD** can benefit from note-taking apps like Obsidian, Notion, and Evernote, which could be helpful given your need to manage a high volume of ideas and curiosity.

### 1. **Obsidian for Building a "Second Brain"**
Obsidian is highly recommended for building a "second brain"—a personal knowledge management system. This approach can be very beneficial for people with ADHD who need to capture and connect a lot of ideas. Obsidian allows you to create a **web of interconnected thoughts**, helping you visualize relationships between concepts, which is ideal for associative thinkers who may struggle with linear organization. The **graph view** helps you see all your notes as a network, making it easier to retrieve and expand on ideas.

Additionally, **plugins** like the **Daily Notes Plugin** and the **Kanban Plugin** allow for easy tracking of tasks and linking notes to specific projects or categories, offering structure without being rigid. This approach supports managing hyperfocus and enabling flexibility, which is often helpful for ADHD brains that are overwhelmed by overly rigid systems 【91†source】【94†source】.

### 2. **NotePlan for Task Management and Planning**
**NotePlan** is another excellent tool that combines note-taking with strong **task management and time-blocking** features. It is particularly useful for individuals with ADHD because it integrates tasks and events seamlessly, reducing context switching—a common challenge for those with ADHD. The **calendar integration** allows you to view notes alongside your schedule, helping you keep track of upcoming tasks and allocate specific times for activities.

NotePlan’s **Markdown-based note-taking** also keeps things simple, allowing you to focus on content instead of complex formatting, which can help minimize distractions. Its daily planning features also allow you to break tasks down into manageable pieces, promoting focus and productivity 【93†source】.

### 3. **Evernote and Notion for Versatility and Integration**
- **Evernote** offers robust organization features with **tags, notebooks, and web clipper** tools that allow you to capture and categorize information effectively. It also supports **cross-device synchronization**, making it easy to capture thoughts on the go. The combination of text, images, and attachments in a single place allows you to manage different types of information comfortably, which can be particularly helpful for keeping varied ideas in one system.
  
- **Notion** is another highly versatile option, especially for people who thrive on having everything organized into **databases and tables**. Notion allows you to create **linked pages, to-do lists, Kanban boards, and more**, all in one place. However, it can be overwhelming for someone just starting to build a note system because of its extensive customization options. If you like to experiment with complex setups, Notion could be a great fit, but it might require more upfront time investment compared to simpler tools like NotePlan 【92†source】【93†source】.

### 4. **Best Practices and Techniques for ADHD**
- **Linking Notes**: Using **bi-directional linking** in apps like Obsidian can help people with ADHD by providing an associative way to connect thoughts. Instead of trying to remember specific keywords, you can use associations to navigate your ideas more naturally.
- **Visual Organization**: Many ADHD-friendly note-taking apps, such as Notion and Trello, include **Kanban boards** and other visual organization methods that can help make information more accessible. This visualization aids in **processing complex ideas** and making connections that might not be obvious with linear note-taking.
- **Templates**: Utilizing **pre-designed templates** is another useful strategy. Templates can provide a consistent structure for different types of notes, reducing the decision fatigue associated with starting from scratch every time. This consistency helps people with ADHD avoid becoming overwhelmed by the note-taking process 【92†source】.

### Summary of Tools and Techniques
- **Obsidian**: Great for building a web of knowledge, visualizing connections, and using plugins for flexibility. Best for linking ideas and creating a "second brain."
- **NotePlan**: Strong at integrating **calendar and task management** features, helpful for reducing context switching, and organizing time-blocked tasks effectively.
- **Evernote and Notion**: These tools provide robust features for capturing a wide range of content types, and they can help structure ideas into more organized formats. **Notion** is particularly strong for those who prefer database-style organization, while **Evernote** excels in straightforward note capture and categorization.

By choosing the right tool and adopting ADHD-friendly strategies like **linking, visual organization, and templates**, you can build a note-taking system that helps manage ideas effectively without being overwhelming. This approach not only helps capture fleeting thoughts but also makes it easier to navigate and expand upon those ideas over time.
