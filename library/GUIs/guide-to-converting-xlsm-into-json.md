**Summary of the prompt:** You would like a detailed guide on how to convert specific tabs from an XLSM file into JSON. The tabs you want to focus on are: GHGs, Water Consumption, Air Pollution, Land Use, Waste, Water Pollution, and Combined Value Factors.

### Steps to Convert XLSM Tabs into JSON

The goal is to extract the data from the specified tabs of your Excel file and convert them into JSON format. Here's a detailed guide on how you can do this.

#### 1. **Install Required Tools**
You will need Python with the `pandas` library to handle the Excel file and convert the data into JSON. Ensure you have `pandas` and `openpyxl` installed.

```bash
pip install pandas openpyxl
```

#### 2. **Read the XLSM File**
Here is a Python script to load your Excel file and extract data from the relevant tabs.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the XLSM file
file_path = 'your_file_path_here.xlsm'

# Read the Excel file
xlsm_data = pd.ExcelFile(file_path)

# List all sheet names (optional to check available sheets)
print(xlsm_data.sheet_names)

# Extract data from each required tab into a DataFrame
ghg_df = pd.read_excel(xlsm_data, sheet_name='GHGs')
water_consumption_df = pd.read_excel(xlsm_data, sheet_name='Water Consumption')
air_pollution_df = pd.read_excel(xlsm_data, sheet_name='Air Pollution')
land_use_df = pd.read_excel(xlsm_data, sheet_name='Land Use & Conversion')
waste_df = pd.read_excel(xlsm_data, sheet_name='Waste')
water_pollution_df = pd.read_excel(xlsm_data, sheet_name='Water Pollution')
combined_vf_df = pd.read_excel(xlsm_data, sheet_name='Combined VFs >>')
```

#### 3. **Clean the Data (Optional)**
Depending on the structure of each sheet, you may need to clean or reshape the data for easier conversion to JSON. For example, you may want to drop unnecessary rows, rename columns, or handle missing values.

```python
# Clean or process data if needed
# Example: Drop empty rows or columns (if applicable)
ghg_df.dropna(how='all', inplace=True)
```

#### 4. **Convert Each DataFrame to JSON**
Once the data is in a clean form, you can easily convert it to JSON format using the `to_json` function.

```python
# Convert each DataFrame to JSON format
ghg_json = ghg_df.to_json(orient='records')
water_consumption_json = water_consumption_df.to_json(orient='records')
air_pollution_json = air_pollution_df.to_json(orient='records')
land_use_json = land_use_df.to_json(orient='records')
waste_json = waste_df.to_json(orient='records')
water_pollution_json = water_pollution_df.to_json(orient='records')
combined_vf_json = combined_vf_df.to_json(orient='records')

# Save JSON to file (optional)
with open('ghg.json', 'w') as f:
    f.write(ghg_json)
```

#### 5. **Handle Special Data (Optional)**
Some tabs may contain formulas or complex data structures, which you may need to preprocess before conversion. For example, if there are formula-driven values, ensure the raw data is extracted correctly.

#### 6. **Merge the JSON Files (Optional)**
If you wish to combine the JSON data from all tabs into one file, you can create a dictionary to store each tabâ€™s JSON output and then save the combined result.

```python
# Create a combined JSON object
combined_json = {
    'GHGs': ghg_json,
    'Water Consumption': water_consumption_json,
    'Air Pollution': air_pollution_json,
    'Land Use': land_use_json,
    'Waste': waste_json,
    'Water Pollution': water_pollution_json,
    'Combined Value Factors': combined_vf_json
}

# Save the combined JSON to a file
with open('combined_value_factors.json', 'w') as f:
    f.write(json.dumps(combined_json, indent=4))
```

#### 7. **Test Your JSON Output**
Finally, verify the generated JSON files by loading them back and inspecting the structure to ensure everything was extracted correctly.
