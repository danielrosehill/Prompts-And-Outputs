Yes, there are a few GUI tools available on Fedora that can help you manage Wake on LAN (WoL) settings. Here are a couple of options:

### 1. **GNOME Tweaks (GNOME Network Settings)**
   - **Description**: If you are using the GNOME desktop environment, **GNOME Tweaks** provides a GUI for various network-related settings, though it's a bit limited for Wake on LAN directly. You can still configure network-related settings, and combined with `nm-connection-editor`, you can configure more advanced options.
   - **Installation**:
     ```bash
     sudo dnf install gnome-tweaks
     ```

   - **Usage**: Open **GNOME Tweaks** from your application menu, navigate to **Network** settings, and from there, you can configure basic network parameters.

### 2. **nm-connection-editor (NetworkManager Connection Editor)**
   - **Description**: This is a more advanced GUI tool for managing network connections in Fedora, including options like Wake on LAN. It is part of the NetworkManager suite, allowing you to edit the properties of network interfaces.
   - **Installation**:
     ```bash
     sudo dnf install network-manager-applet
     ```
   - **Usage**:
     - Open the **Network Connections** editor with the following command:
       ```bash
       nm-connection-editor
       ```
     - Select your network interface (`enp6s0`), go to the **Ethernet** tab, and you will find options to enable **Wake on LAN**.
   
   This tool provides a user-friendly way to configure network settings without needing to manually edit configuration files.

### 3. **TLPUI (GUI for TLP)**
   - **Description**: **TLPUI** is a graphical interface for the TLP power management tool, which can be used to configure Wake on LAN and other power-saving settings.
   - **Installation**:
     - First, install TLP and TLPUI:
       ```bash
       sudo dnf install tlp tlpui
       ```
   - **Usage**: Launch **TLPUI** from your application menu, and you can configure various power-related settings, including Wake on LAN, through the user interface.

These GUI options can simplify the process of managing WoL settings on your Fedora system.
