# Prompt

I use AMD Radeon RX 7700 XT Pulse Gaming 12GB Sapphire + Fedora Workstation 40 + KDE Plasma Wayland

are there any GUIs to manage the GPU? And any that might have brightness control? If so, please suggest projects

# Output

For managing your **AMD Radeon RX 7700 XT Pulse Gaming 12GB** on Fedora Workstation 40 with **KDE Plasma on Wayland**, there are a few GUI tools available that can help you manage the GPU settings, though specific options for **brightness control** are often limited to software solutions or display-specific controls. Here are some relevant GUI tools and projects that might work well:

### 1. **CoreCtrl**
   - **CoreCtrl** is one of the best GUI tools for managing AMD GPUs on Linux. It allows you to tweak various settings, including fan speeds, power limits, and overclocking. It's similar to AMD’s Wattman on Windows and gives you fine control over your Radeon card.
   - While **CoreCtrl** does not directly control screen brightness (since brightness is usually managed through DDC/CI or the desktop environment), it is excellent for GPU performance management.
   - **Installation**:
     ```
     sudo dnf install corectrl
     ```
   - **Features**:
     - Adjust fan curves.
     - Overclock GPU and memory.
     - Control power consumption.
   - **Brightness Control**: Not directly supported but valuable for managing power efficiency, which may affect screen brightness through power savings.

### 2. **Radeon Profile**
   - **Radeon Profile** is another tool that offers some basic control over AMD Radeon GPUs. It’s more lightweight than CoreCtrl but allows you to switch between different power profiles, which can indirectly affect power usage and heat output.
   - While it doesn’t control brightness, it could affect display performance and energy use, especially useful in power-saving modes.
   - **Installation**:
     - You'll need to install it from source or find a third-party repository.
   - **Features**:
     - Monitor GPU temperature and performance.
     - Change power profiles (like performance vs. power-saving modes).

### 3. **Plasma System Settings (KDE Display Settings)**
   - **KDE’s Display Settings** provide basic display and scaling management. While it may not control GPU-specific settings or directly control external monitor brightness, you can manage brightness on **internal laptop displays** and apply scaling options for better performance.
   - **Wayland Brightness Control**: This is mostly limited to your internal display or laptop screen, with external monitors managed through DDC/CI or hardware buttons.

### 4. **AMDGPU Pro Control (CLI with Optional GUI Frontends)**
   - **AMDGPU-Pro** provides a set of tools for controlling your AMD GPU, but most advanced options are via the command line.
   - GUIs that integrate with these tools are less common on Linux but could work well when paired with performance management applications like **CoreCtrl**.
   - **Installation**: Fedora usually uses the **Mesa** open-source driver, but if you're interested, you can install **AMDGPU-Pro** directly for additional functionality.

### 5. **Custom Scripts + KDE Slider**
   - You could create a custom **KDE Plasma** applet or slider that controls brightness via scripts if your GPU driver or monitor supports adjusting brightness through a command-line tool.
   - While this requires more manual configuration, combining `ddcutil` or another command-line tool with KDE Plasma widgets can give you a graphical slider to control brightness across multiple displays.
   - **Example Script**: A custom script that adjusts brightness on all displays, tied to a custom widget in KDE Plasma.

### 6. **GreenWithEnvy (GWE)** (For NVIDIA GPUs but mentioned for completeness)
   - Though **GWE** is designed for **NVIDIA GPUs**, it’s worth mentioning for users who might have multi-GPU setups or are switching to NVIDIA. It offers fan control, overclocking, and performance monitoring similar to CoreCtrl but only for NVIDIA.

### Summary:
For managing your **AMD Radeon RX 7700 XT** on Fedora KDE Plasma Wayland:
- **CoreCtrl** is your best bet for GPU management, including overclocking, fan speed, and power control.
- **Radeon Profile** offers lightweight control over power profiles.
- **Plasma System Settings** manage basic display settings but do not control the GPU directly.
- **Custom Scripts with KDE Sliders** could give you finer control over brightness if tied to DDC/CI or other software.
