# Prompt

I need to convert this app into something truly cross platform that can run on any device (including Fedora, Ubuntu, WIndows). How can I do that? Make some changes then apply them

# Output

To make this app truly cross-platform and run on any device including Fedora, Ubuntu, and Windows, I would recommend making the following changes:

1. Switch from PyQt5 to Kivy:
   Kivy is a more versatile cross-platform framework that can target desktop OSes as well as mobile platforms. Replace PyQt5 imports and widgets with Kivy equivalents.

2. Use Kivy's KV language for UI:
   Define the UI layout in Kivy's KV language instead of programmatically creating widgets. This provides better separation of UI and logic.

3. Replace platform-specific code:
   Remove any Windows/Mac specific code and use cross-platform libraries and APIs instead. For example, use the `requests` library instead of `QWebEngineView` for web requests.

4. Use Kivy's built-in widgets:
   Replace custom widgets with Kivy's built-in widgets where possible for better cross-platform compatibility.

5. Package with PyInstaller:
   Use PyInstaller to package the Kivy app for different platforms. Kivy has good support for PyInstaller packaging.

6. Use cross-platform file paths:
   Use `os.path` to handle file paths in a cross-platform way instead of hardcoding paths.

7. Handle platform differences:
   Use `platform` module to detect the OS and handle any necessary platform-specific code.

Here's a basic example of how the main structure could look after conversion:

```python
from kivy.app import App
from kivy.uix.boxlayout import BoxLayout
from kivy.uix.label import Label
from kivy.uix.button import Button
from kivy.clock import Clock
import requests
import platform

class MainWindow(BoxLayout):
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(**kwargs)
        self.orientation = 'vertical'
        
        self.title = Label(text="Israel Emergency Monitoring Portal")
        self.add_widget(self.title)
        
        self.time_display = Label()
        self.add_widget(self.time_display)
        Clock.schedule_interval(self.update_time, 1)
        
        # Add other widgets and functionality here

    def update_time(self, dt):
        # Update time display
        pass

class EmergencyMonitorApp(App):
    def build(self):
        return MainWindow()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    EmergencyMonitorApp().run()
```

This structure provides a good starting point for a cross-platform Kivy app. You'll need to implement the rest of the functionality using Kivy widgets and APIs. Remember to test thoroughly on all target platforms to ensure compatibility and consistent behavior.
