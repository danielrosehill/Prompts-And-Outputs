**Prompt Summary:** You are asking about the main GUI tools for working with QMK firmware on Fedora.

---

While QMK is traditionally managed via the command line, there are a few graphical interfaces (GUIs) available that make it easier to configure and work with QMK on Fedora. Here are the main GUI options:

### **1. VIA**
   - **Description:** **VIA** is a popular GUI for configuring QMK-compatible keyboards. It allows you to create and modify keymaps, set up macros, and adjust lighting without needing to reflash the firmware each time. Some keyboards come pre-flashed with VIA-compatible firmware, while others need a compatible firmware version.
   - **Features:**
     - **Live Remapping:** Modify keymaps in real time without needing to reflash your keyboard.
     - **Macro Support:** Easily create and edit macros, layers, and custom key bindings.
     - **RGB Control:** Adjust RGB lighting settings for keyboards that support it.
   - **Installation on Fedora:**
     - You can download the AppImage from [caniusevia.com](https://caniusevia.com/) and run it on Fedora:
       ```bash
       chmod +x VIA.AppImage
       ./VIA.AppImage
       ```
   - **Recommendation:** VIA is great if your keyboard supports it, as it allows for real-time adjustments, which is faster than the traditional QMK workflow.

### **2. VIAL**
   - **Description:** **VIAL** is a fork of VIA that adds more advanced features and broader keyboard support. It’s designed to address some limitations in VIA, providing extra functionality and faster development.
   - **Features:**
     - **Real-Time Configuration:** Just like VIA, but with added support for a wider range of devices.
     - **Advanced Features:** Supports features like encoder control, mouse keys, and more complex macro setups.
     - **No Compilation Needed:** VIAL simplifies the process of keymap creation and modification by eliminating the need for firmware recompilation.
   - **Installation on Fedora:**
     - You can download VIAL directly from [get.vial.today](https://get.vial.today). Choose the AppImage version for Linux:
       ```bash
       chmod +x Vial.AppImage
       ./Vial.AppImage
       ```
   - **Recommendation:** If your keyboard isn’t officially supported by VIA or if you need more advanced features, try VIAL. It’s more versatile and often receives updates faster.

### **3. QMK Configurator (Web-Based GUI)**
   - **Description:** The **QMK Configurator** is an official web-based GUI tool for creating and customizing QMK firmware layouts. It’s not a standalone application, but it allows you to design your keymap and download the firmware file, which you can then flash to your keyboard using QMK CLI.
   - **Features:**
     - **Easy Keymap Design:** Drag-and-drop interface to customize key layouts and layers.
     - **Download and Flash:** After designing, download the firmware and use the QMK CLI to flash it.
     - **Macros and Layers:** Supports complex key combinations, macros, and multiple layers.
   - **Usage:**
     - Visit [config.qmk.fm](https://config.qmk.fm/), create your custom layout, and download the firmware file.
     - Use the QMK CLI to flash the downloaded firmware:
       ```bash
       qmk flash -kb <keyboard_name> -km <your_custom_keymap>
       ```
   - **Recommendation:** This is ideal for those who don’t want to install additional software. It provides a straightforward way to create custom layouts but still requires you to use the command line for flashing.

### **4. QMK Toolbox**
   - **Description:** **QMK Toolbox** is a cross-platform tool that simplifies the process of flashing firmware to QMK-compatible keyboards. It doesn’t allow you to design keymaps but makes it easier to upload custom firmware from the QMK Configurator or other tools.
   - **Features:**
     - **Easy Flashing:** Detects connected devices and simplifies the process of flashing new firmware.
     - **Supports Multiple Bootloaders:** Works with several types of keyboard bootloaders (DFU, Caterina, Bootmapper Client, etc.).
     - **Monitor and Debug:** Allows for real-time monitoring of debug messages, making it useful for troubleshooting.
   - **Installation on Fedora:**
     - You can download the latest AppImage from [QMK Toolbox GitHub](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_toolbox/releases) and run it:
       ```bash
       chmod +x qmk_toolbox.AppImage
       ./qmk_toolbox.AppImage
       ```
   - **Recommendation:** If you’re comfortable using the QMK Configurator for creating keymaps but want an easier way to flash firmware, QMK Toolbox is a handy companion tool.

### **Summary and Recommendation**
For a fully graphical experience on Fedora:
- **VIA** and **VIAL** are the top choices for real-time keymap configuration, with **VIAL** offering more advanced features and broader compatibility.
- If you prefer a **web-based approach**, the **QMK Configurator** is easy to use and does not require installation, but you’ll need to use the QMK CLI or **QMK Toolbox** for flashing firmware.
- **QMK Toolbox** is a great utility to have alongside any of these tools, simplifying the firmware flashing process and supporting various bootloaders.

Overall, **VIAL** would be the most versatile choice if your keyboard supports it, as it allows easy real-time changes, advanced configuration, and eliminates the need for constant firmware recompilation.
