**Summary of your prompt**: You are planning to get blue light glasses made today for nighttime use and would like to know what kind of tint would be most effective, considering you have a high prescription and need an eye test.

### Key Tips for Blue Light Glasses for Nighttime Use:
1. **Look for Amber or Dark Orange Tint**:
   - For maximum effectiveness at night, particularly to block out blue light from screens, you should ask for lenses with an **amber** or **dark orange** tint. These tints block **90-100%** of blue light, which is most disruptive to melatonin production and sleep quality. These lenses tend to have a stronger color tint and are recommended for evening or nighttime use when you want to block as much blue light as possible.

2. **Consider Clear Lenses for Daytime Use**:
   - Clear blue light glasses typically block less blue light (around 20-50%) but are better suited for daytime use, especially if you're spending long hours in front of screens. However, for nighttime use, darker tints will be more effective.

3. **High Rx Consideration**:
   - Since you have a high prescription, ensure that the lenses are **high-index** (thin lenses) to keep them lightweight and comfortable. Some high-index lenses come with blue light filtering options, so check if thatâ€™s an option when ordering.

4. **Ask for Specific Blue Light Blockage Percentage**:
   - Ask your optician or eye care provider about the **percentage of blue light the glasses will block**, especially for wavelengths in the **400-500nm range**, which are most disruptive during night use.

5. **AR Coating with Blue Light Filtering**:
   - Consider an **anti-reflective (AR) coating** that includes blue light filtering. This reduces glare from screens and improves visual comfort.

### Tips for the Eye Test:
- Let your optician know about your interest in blue light glasses, and they might offer recommendations tailored to your prescription and needs.
  
By focusing on an amber or orange tint, you can ensure maximum blue light protection at night, which can help improve your sleep quality and minimize disruption caused by screen use before bed. Let me know if you need further details!
