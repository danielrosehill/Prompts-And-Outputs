## CDP Reporting Timeline

Companies typically follow a calendar year reporting period (January 1 to December 31)\[1]. For 2023 emissions, the process would work as follows:

- Data collection period: Approximately 3 months for carbon footprint data gathering\[1]
- CDP portal opens: April of the following year\[1]
- Submission deadline: End of July of the following year\[1]
- Total time: Companies have about 7 months from the end of the reporting year to compute emissions, complete questionnaires, and conduct internal reviews\[1]

## EPA GHGRP Timeline

For the EPA's Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program:

- Approximately 8,000 facilities report their emissions annually
- Data is made publicly available in October of each year\[3]

## SEC Requirements (New Rules from 2024)

Under the SEC's new climate disclosure rules:

- Companies will have until their second fiscal quarter Form 10-Q filing date to provide annual GHG emission disclosures\[2]
- The rules will begin with annual reports for the year ending December 31, 2025, for calendar-year-end large accelerated filers\[2]

Therefore, for a company's 2023 emissions:

- If reporting to CDP: The report would typically be submitted by July 2024
- If reporting to EPA GHGRP: The data would become public in October 2024
- Under new SEC rules: This timeline will apply to future reporting years starting with 2025 emissions
