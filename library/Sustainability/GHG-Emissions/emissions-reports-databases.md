## Key Features

These databases offer:

- Standardized reporting formats
- Historical emissions data
- Breakdown by scope (1, 2, and 3)
- Company targets and progress tracking
- Data verification and assurance information

However, it's worth noting that while these databases are comprehensive, they may not contain every company report, as some data points rely on voluntary disclosure and different reporting standards. The most complete access to emissions data typically comes from combining multiple database sources.
