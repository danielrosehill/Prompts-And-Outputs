# Prompt
Can you suggest a robust template for a home backup plan. Let's say that the objective is documenting my process for documenting my desktop incrementally once a week onto an external SSD. How should I structure that document?

# Output
**Summary**: You asked for a robust template to document a home backup plan for incrementally backing up your desktop weekly to an external SSD.

Here's a structured template to help you document this home backup process in detail:

# **Home Backup Plan: Incremental Desktop Backups to External SSD**

---

### **1. Overview**
   - **Objective**: Ensure an incremental backup of the desktop system occurs weekly on an external SSD to protect against data loss.
   - **Backup Type**: Incremental backup (only new or changed files after the last backup).
   - **Frequency**: Weekly
   - **Storage Device**: External SSD (specify model, capacity, and file system format, e.g., ext4).

### **2. Backup Specifications**
   - **Source Location**: Specify directories to back up (e.g., `/home/daniel/Documents`, `/home/daniel/Pictures`).
   - **Exclusions**: Specify any directories or files to exclude from the backup (e.g., `/mnt` or temporary files).
   - **Backup Tool**: Specify the software tool (e.g., Restic, Borg, rsync) and its version.

### **3. Hardware and Software Requirements**
   - **External SSD Setup**: 
     - Mount point (e.g., `/mnt/desktop-backups`).
     - UUID (if automatic mounting is configured).
     - Storage capacity requirements.
   - **System Requirements**: Minimum OS version, required permissions, and software dependencies.

### **4. Backup Process Steps**
   - **Step 1: Preparation**  
      - Connect the external SSD and confirm it is properly mounted at `/mnt/desktop-backups`.
      - Ensure the device is recognized and has sufficient storage space for new backups.
   - **Step 2: Backup Execution**  
      - Launch the backup tool (e.g., Restic) using the following command:
         ```bash
         sudo /path/to/restic-backup.sh
         ```
      - Log any command options (e.g., `--exclude`, `--verbose`) used during backup.
   - **Step 3: Verification**  
      - Verify the backup by restoring a sample file.
      - Run checksums or hash verification if available.
   - **Step 4: Completion**  
      - Unmount the SSD safely and store it securely.
      - Log the backup completion date, any errors, and the verification status.

### **5. Automation Setup**
   - **Automated Trigger**: Weekly backup scheduled through cron:
      ```bash
      0 2 * * 1 /path/to/restic-backup.sh
      ```
   - **Logging**: Store logs in `/home/daniel/backup-logs/` with timestamps for tracking.

### **6. Restore Process**
   - **Location of Backup Data**: Define the exact path where backup data is stored on the SSD.
   - **Restore Command**: Specify the restore command:
      ```bash
      restic restore --target /home/daniel/restore-target
      ```
   - **Verification**: Verify that the restored files match the originals by checking file sizes and hashes.

### **7. Maintenance and Monitoring**
   - **Weekly Check**: Verify each backup's completion and inspect logs for errors.
   - **Disk Health Monitoring**: Monthly health check of the external SSD.
   - **Retention Policy**: Define data retention rules (e.g., "Retain last 4 weekly backups").

### **8. Troubleshooting Guide**
   - Common errors (e.g., "Disk not mounted," "Permission denied") and resolutions.
   - Command to check if the disk is mounted correctly:
      ```bash
      lsblk | grep /mnt/desktop-backups
      ```

### **9. Backup Plan Review and Updates**
   - **Date of Last Update**: [Insert date]
   - **Review Frequency**: Quarterly review of backup settings and hardware.
   - **Next Scheduled Update**: [Insert date]

---

### **10. Additional Notes**
   - Document any planned improvements to the backup process.
   - Outline any configuration changes to the backup tool or SSD mounting.
