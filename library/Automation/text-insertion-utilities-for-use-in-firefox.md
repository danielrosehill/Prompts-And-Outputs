The information provided is for demonstrative purposes only and is intended to highlight constraints and capabilities in LLM applications and prompt engineering strategies.*


# Prompt

I spend a lot of time prompting LLMs and working with them professionally. Frequently I need to enter the same text strings whether in prompts or in feedback messages - things like "please return the full codeblock in one go". I'd love to be able to speed this up a bit. 

It would be useful to have something like a text snippet manager. Ideally I would press on a hotkey which would trigger this to open. Then I can search through my snippets and select one to quickly paste it into whatever context window I had active. 

The context I would require the snippets in would be an open browser window.

I use Fedora Linux

Are there any Firefox extensions that I might be able to use for this purpose? Perpaps I could trigger the selection window to open up with a specific hotkey and then select the write snippet. Then insert that into where I had my cursory previously.

If not Firefox, think of another browser that could potentially support this

# Output

Based on your requirements, the Clippings extension for Firefox seems to be an excellent solution for managing and quickly inserting text snippets while working with LLMs. Here's how it can meet your needs:

## Clippings Extension for Firefox

Clippings is a Firefox extension that allows you to save and manage frequently-used text snippets for quick pasting[1][2]. It offers several features that align with your requirements:

### Key Features

1. **Quick Access**: You can access your saved snippets through a context menu or keyboard shortcuts[1][2].

2. **Hotkey Support**: The default hotkey combination is Alt + Shift + Y, followed by a custom shortcut you assign to each snippet. This can be customized to your preference[1].

3. **Search Functionality**: You can locate specific snippets by typing their names, which will appear in an autocomplete menu[2].

4. **Browser Integration**: Clippings works directly within Firefox, allowing you to paste snippets into any web page form or text field[2].

5. **Organization**: You can organize your snippets into folders using the Clippings Manager[1][2].

6. **Customization**: Snippets can be assigned color labels and shortcut keys for quicker access[2].

### Usage in Your Workflow

1. Save your frequently used LLM prompts and feedback messages as snippets.
2. Assign hotkeys to your most common snippets for rapid access.
3. When working with LLMs, use the assigned hotkey to quickly insert the desired snippet.
4. For less frequently used snippets, use the search functionality to find and insert them.

## Alternative Options

If Clippings doesn't fully meet your needs or if you're open to using other browsers, here are some alternatives:

1. **Browserwide Solutions**: Consider browser-agnostic text expansion tools like AutoHotkey (for Windows) or AutoKey (for Linux). These work across all applications, not just browsers.

2. **Chrome Extensions**: If you're willing to switch browsers, Chrome offers similar extensions like "Text Blaze" or "Auto Text Expander" that provide comparable functionality.

3. **System-wide Snippet Managers**: Applications like Ditto (clipboard manager) or CopyQ can be used across all applications on your Fedora Linux system, providing similar functionality but with a broader scope.

Given your specific requirements and use of Fedora Linux, the Clippings extension for Firefox appears to be the most straightforward and suitable solution. It integrates well with your browser-based workflow and offers the quick access and organization features you need for efficient LLM interactions[1][2].
