# Prompt

I'm running this script from /home/daniel/ansible
I thought if I ran the playbook command on it it would populate those files in the repo and then sync to github?

# Output

I apologize for the confusion. You're right that running the playbook should populate the files in the repo and then sync to GitHub. However, there are a few issues we need to address:

1. The error message indicates that the `ansible-playbook` command is not found. This suggests that Ansible might not be installed or not in your system's PATH.

2. The playbook itself needs to be designed to gather information from your desktop and create the necessary files.

Let's address these issues step by step:

1. First, make sure Ansible is installed:
   ```
   sudo dnf install ansible
   ```

2. Now, let's create a playbook that will gather information from your desktop and create the necessary files. Save this as `gather_desktop_info.yml` in `/home/daniel/ansible-desktop-to-laptop`:

```yaml
---
- name: Gather Desktop Information
  hosts: localhost
  connection: local
  become: no

  vars:
    repo_path: "/home/daniel/ansible-desktop-to-laptop"

  tasks:
    - name: Ensure required directories exist
      file:
        path: "{{ repo_path }}/{{ item }}"
        state: directory
      loop:
        - configs
        - appimages

    - name: Get list of installed packages
      command: dnf list installed
      register: installed_packages
      changed_when: false

    - name: Save installed packages list
      copy:
        content: "{{ installed_packages.stdout_lines[1:] | map('regex_replace', '^(\\S+).*', '\\1') | join('\n') }}"
        dest: "{{ repo_path }}/installed_packages.txt"

    - name: Get list of installed Flatpaks
      command: flatpak list --app --columns=application
      register: flatpak_list
      changed_when: false

    - name: Save Flatpak list
      copy:
        content: "{{ flatpak_list.stdout }}"
        dest: "{{ repo_path }}/flatpak_list.txt"

    - name: Copy configuration files
      copy:
        src: "/home/{{ ansible_user_id }}/{{ item }}"
        dest: "{{ repo_path }}/configs/{{ item }}"
      loop:
        - .bashrc
        - .vimrc
        - .gitconfig

    - name: Find AppImages
      find:
        paths: "/home/{{ ansible_user_id }}/.local/share/applications"
        patterns: "*.AppImage"
      register: found_appimages

    - name: Copy AppImages
      copy:
        src: "{{ item.path }}"
        dest: "{{ repo_path }}/appimages/"
      loop: "{{ found_appimages.files }}"

    - name: Commit and push changes to GitHub
      shell: |
        cd {{ repo_path }}
        git add .
        git commit -m "Update desktop configuration $(date +%Y-%m-%d)"
        git push origin main
      ignore_errors: yes
```

3. Run this playbook:
   ```
   ansible-playbook /home/daniel/ansible-desktop-to-laptop/gather_desktop_info.yml
   ```

This playbook will:
1. Create the necessary directories in your repo.
2. Gather information about installed packages, Flatpaks, and AppImages.
3. Copy your configuration files.
4. Commit and push the changes to GitHub.

Make sure you've initialized the Git repository in `/home/daniel/ansible-desktop-to-laptop` and set up the remote to your GitHub repo before running this playbook.

After running this playbook, your repository should be populated with the necessary files and synced to GitHub. You can then use the `sync_config.yml` playbook we created earlier on your laptop to apply these configurations.

Remember to run this `gather_desktop_info.yml` playbook periodically on your desktop to keep the repository updated with your latest configurations.
