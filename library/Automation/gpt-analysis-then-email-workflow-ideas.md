# Prompt

Is there any easier platform than Zapier to create an automation like this:

Poll an API -> Get data as JSON -> Format that into one big text string -> Run that through GPT -> Convert into email -> Send that as an email

# Output

Yes, there are a few platforms that can provide a simpler and more user-friendly experience than Zapier, depending on the complexity of your automation. Here are some alternatives that may make it easier to create the automation you described:

### 1. **Make (formerly Integromat)**
   - **Pros**: Make is visually intuitive with its drag-and-drop builder, making it easier for users to create complex automations without much technical expertise. It also supports multiple steps in a workflow with greater customization than Zapier.
   - **Cons**: Can still have a learning curve if you're new to automation tools.
   - **How It Fits Your Workflow**:
     - **HTTP Module** to poll the API and get JSON data.
     - **Text Formatter Module** to format the JSON into a single text string.
     - **OpenAI (GPT-3) Module** to pass the text string through GPT.
     - **Email Module** to send out the email.

### 2. **Pipedream**
   - **Pros**: Pipedream is built for developers and allows you to quickly set up integrations between APIs with minimal code. It supports a wide range of APIs and offers straightforward integration with GPT-3.
   - **Cons**: Requires a bit of coding knowledge, but the pre-built templates make things easier.
   - **How It Fits Your Workflow**:
     - You can write a script to poll an API and work with JSON directly.
     - You can integrate with GPT-3 via OpenAI's API and format it as desired.
     - Pipedream can trigger sending an email using services like SendGrid or Gmail.

### 3. **IFTTT Pro**
   - **Pros**: Simpler than Zapier for creating lightweight automation. It uses a very straightforward "If This, Then That" logic and is generally very easy to use.
   - **Cons**: Limited compared to more sophisticated tools like Zapier or Make, especially for complex workflows.
   - **How It Fits Your Workflow**:
     - Might need to use multiple applets to achieve the full functionality, and it can be hard to work with JSON formatting.

### 4. **n8n**
   - **Pros**: n8n is an open-source automation tool that is highly flexible. It can be self-hosted, which makes it a good choice if you need more control or want to avoid recurring fees. It has nodes that help to format JSON, connect with APIs, and trigger emails.
   - **Cons**: Hosting yourself requires some technical setup.
   - **How It Fits Your Workflow**:
     - **HTTP Request Node** for polling the API.
     - **JavaScript Function Node** for JSON formatting.
     - **OpenAI Node** for integrating GPT-3.
     - **Email Node** to send the email.

### 5. **Microsoft Power Automate**
   - **Pros**: If you're in the Microsoft ecosystem, Power Automate offers seamless integration with Office products. It’s highly capable of automating repetitive tasks, and its user-friendly design makes creating workflows quite straightforward.
   - **Cons**: It can be a bit restrictive if you need advanced customization outside the Microsoft ecosystem.
   - **How It Fits Your Workflow**:
     - **HTTP Request Action** to get JSON data.
     - Use built-in actions for JSON parsing and string formatting.
     - **AI Builder** could potentially be used for some simple AI-based content creation.
     - Send the result using **Outlook**.

### 6. **Bardeen**
   - **Pros**: Bardeen is a newer automation platform that is focused on making automation easy, particularly for repetitive web tasks. It’s much simpler to set up compared to Zapier, and it’s highly focused on data workflows.
   - **Cons**: Limited flexibility when compared to Zapier or Make.
   - **How It Fits Your Workflow**:
     - Can scrape and collect data from web pages.
     - Integration with OpenAI is available.
     - You can set up workflows to send automated emails.

### Summary:
If you're looking for a **visual and less technical tool**, **Make** is likely the best option, as it combines power and simplicity. For a **developer-friendly but easy-to-use solution**, **Pipedream** offers an excellent balance of control and ease. If you prefer something more lightweight and intuitive, **IFTTT** or **Bardeen** might be easier to start with, although they may not have the full flexibility you need.
