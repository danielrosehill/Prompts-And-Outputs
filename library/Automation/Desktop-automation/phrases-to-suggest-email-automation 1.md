Hereâ€™s a list of sentences you can add to emails to give them a more AI-generated or automated tone:

1. "This response has been formulated based on the provided inputs and parameters."


2. "The content of this message was generated based on an analysis of prior communications."


3. "This email has been created to streamline communication and enhance efficiency."


4. "My system has compiled the following information for your reference."


5. "I have processed your request and generated the appropriate response."


6. "The following suggestions are the result of an automated synthesis of relevant data."


7. "This message has been optimized for clarity and conciseness using predictive algorithms."


8. "This communication is the result of a structured process to ensure a prompt response."


9. "Based on the current context and previous interactions, I have generated the following action items."


10. "This response was automatically composed to ensure timely and consistent communication."



You can sprinkle one or two of these in your emails to subtly suggest they were AI-assisted!
