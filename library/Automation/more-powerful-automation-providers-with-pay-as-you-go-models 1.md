# Prompt

Do any of these automation platforms offer pay as you pricing that would allow you to only pay for the automations that run?

# Output

Here is how some of the automation platforms you are considering handle pricing:

1. **Make (formerly Integromat)**:
   - Make offers a **pay-as-you-go pricing model**. You only pay based on the number of operations your automation workflows run. This is ideal for scenarios where usage fluctuates, as you can scale your operations up or down as needed without paying for a fixed number of tasks upfront.
   - Make provides **free tier options** as well, which could allow you to test or run low-volume workflows without immediate cost.

2. **Pipedream**:
   - Pipedream offers a **pay-per-workflow-run** pricing model. You are billed based on the number of invocations (events that trigger a workflow) and compute time. This makes it very flexible for usage patterns that vary over time.
   - There is also a **free tier** for up to a certain number of workflow invocations per month, making it a good option if you want to start small and scale.

3. **Tray.io**:
   - Tray.io does not follow a traditional pay-as-you-go model. It is typically **subscription-based**, with pricing tiers based on workflow complexity, integrations, and volume. Tray.io is more suited for businesses that need consistent automation at scale rather than on-demand usage.

4. **Automate.io**:
   - Before its acquisition by Notion, Automate.io had a pricing model that included both fixed pricing tiers and limits based on tasks per month. However, with the transition into Notion, their pricing may change. It previously allowed some flexibility in automations but was not as granular as pay-as-you-go.

### Recommendation:
If **pay-as-you-go pricing** is important for your use case (where you only want to pay for automation runs that happen), **Make** and **Pipedream** would be your best options. Both offer flexible pricing that scales with the actual usage of your workflows, allowing you to optimize costs based on the specific number of automations triggered.
