**Summary of the prompt:** The user asked for an explanation of the different NFC CLIs available on Fedora and whether `libnfc` is different from `nfc-utils`.

### Overview of NFC Tools on Fedora

On Fedora, there are several command-line tools and libraries for working with NFC devices. Each has its own focus and functionality. Here's a breakdown:

### 1. **`libnfc`**
- **Description:** `libnfc` is a low-level library that provides the core functionality to communicate with NFC devices. It is a foundational component that other tools and applications build upon. 
- **Functionality:** It allows direct interaction with NFC hardware and provides the necessary APIs for reading from and writing to NFC tags.
- **Usage:** Typically used by developers and integrated into other software. Directly, it provides utilities for basic operations like polling for tags, reading, and writing data, especially for MIFARE Classic tags.

### 2. **`nfc-utils`**
- **Relationship to `libnfc`:** `nfc-utils` is a set of command-line tools that are built **on top of `libnfc`**. It uses `libnfc` as the underlying library to communicate with NFC devices but provides easier-to-use CLI commands for common tasks.
- **Tools Included in `nfc-utils`:**
  - **`nfc-poll`:** Scans and detects NFC tags, displaying basic information.
  - **`nfc-list`:** Lists available NFC devices connected to the system.
  - **`nfc-mfclassic`:** Reads from and writes to MIFARE Classic cards, using specific read and write commands.
  - **`nfc-emulate-forum-tag4`:** Used for testing and development, allowing emulation of Type 4 tags.
- **Installation:**
  ```bash
  sudo dnf install nfc-utils
  ```
- **Use Cases:** Handy for users who need straightforward command-line utilities to interact with NFC tags without writing custom scripts. 

### 3. **`pcsc-tools`**
- **Description:** While not specifically designed for NFC, `pcsc-tools` can be used with NFC readers that support the PC/SC (Personal Computer/Smart Card) standard. This tool provides a way to interact with smart cards and certain NFC tags.
- **Key Tool:**
  - **`pcsc_scan`:** Scans for smart cards (and some NFC tags), showing detailed information when a card or tag is detected.
- **Installation:**
  ```bash
  sudo dnf install pcsc-tools
  ```
- **Use Cases:** Useful for diagnostics, especially if you're unsure whether the NFC reader is being detected correctly or if you are dealing with smart cards alongside NFC tags.

### 4. **`nfcpy` (Python Library)**
- **Description:** While not a traditional CLI, `nfcpy` is a Python library that provides higher-level tools for developing NFC applications. It allows for custom scripts to be written to read from, write to, and interact with NFC tags.
- **Installation:**
  ```bash
  pip install nfcpy
  ```
- **Use Cases:** Best for users who want to create more complex NFC solutions. Itâ€™s also useful for those who need to perform custom actions beyond what `nfc-utils` provides.

### Summary of Differences
- **`libnfc` vs. `nfc-utils`:**
  - **`libnfc`** is a core library, offering low-level functions to communicate directly with NFC hardware. It requires more programming knowledge to use effectively.
  - **`nfc-utils`** provides a set of user-friendly CLI tools that utilize `libnfc` underneath, making it easier for non-developers to perform NFC tasks without writing code.
- **`pcsc-tools`:** Primarily for smart cards but can also recognize some NFC tags, useful for diagnostics.
- **`nfcpy`:** A Python-based solution that allows for extensive customization, suitable for more complex NFC interactions.

Each tool serves a slightly different purpose, so the best choice depends on what you need: basic reading/writing (`nfc-utils`), diagnostics (`pcsc-tools`), custom solutions (`nfcpy`), or direct hardware interaction (`libnfc`).
