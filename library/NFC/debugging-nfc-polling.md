# Provided terminal output

nfc-poll uses libnfc 1.8.0  
NFC reader: ACS ACR1252 1S CL Reader [ACR1252 Dual Reader PICC] 00 00 opened  
NFC device will poll during 36000 ms (20 pollings of 300 ms for 6 modulations)  
No target found.

If `nfc-poll` isn't detecting the NFC tag, it might be due to a few reasons. Here are troubleshooting steps:

### Step 1: Verify NFC Tag Compatibility
- **Check if the tag is NDEF-compliant**: `nfc-poll` works best with NDEF tags. Try another NFC tool or tag to verify.

### Step 2: Ensure LibNFC is Configured Correctly
- Check `/etc/nfc/libnfc.conf` to confirm the correct device connection string.

### Step 3: Increase Polling Time
Try:
```bash
nfc-poll -t 3600000
```
Extend the polling duration to see if it detects the tag.

### Step 4: Use `nfc-list`
Run:
```bash
nfc-list
```
If it detects the tag, you might need to use a different command or tool to read the URL. 

### Step 5: Try Other LibNFC Commands
Use `nfc-mfclassic` to read if it's a MIFARE tag. Otherwise, additional configuration or different tools like **nfcpy** might be needed for full functionality.
