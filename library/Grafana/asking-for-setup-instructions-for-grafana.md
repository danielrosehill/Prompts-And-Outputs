# Prompt

I have just installed Grafana. I'm hoping to use it to build a news monitoring dashboard. I want to embed a few news websites and RSS feeds and I want it to be publicly accessible (no authentication). There are a few things I'd like to do to harden security a little. Firstly separate the login slightly from the main path to protect it. Can you give me a guide to start building this dashboard? Note: Grafana is already installed so you don't need to cover that ground.

# Output

Great! Since you've already installed Grafana, I'll guide you through building your **news monitoring dashboard**, including embedding news websites, adding RSS feeds, and securing the login path while keeping the dashboard publicly accessible.

### Step 1: Embed News Websites into Grafana

Grafana doesn’t directly allow embedding websites into panels, but you can use the **Text Panel** or **HTML Plugin** for embedding web pages. Follow these steps:

1. **Install the `Text` Panel Plugin**:
   - Navigate to **Configuration** > **Plugins** from the left menu.
   - Search for the **Text** panel (it might already be installed by default).
   - If not, install it.

2. **Create a New Dashboard**:
   - From the main screen, click **Create** > **Dashboard**.
   - Add a new **Text Panel**.

3. **Embed a Website using iFrame**:
   - In the text panel, switch to **HTML mode** by clicking the `{}` button.
   - Insert the following HTML to embed a website using an iFrame:
     ```html
     <iframe src="https://example.com" width="100%" height="600px"></iframe>
     ```
     Replace `https://example.com` with the URL of the news website you want to display.
   - Save the panel.

4. **Repeat** to embed additional websites in other panels or tabs as needed.

### Step 2: Add RSS Feeds to Grafana

You’ll need to parse the RSS feeds into a format that Grafana can display. The easiest way to do this is to use **JSON** data sources for RSS feeds by converting them.

#### Option 1: Use a Custom API to Convert RSS to JSON

1. **Use a free API** like [rss2json](https://rss2json.com) to convert RSS feeds to JSON. 
2. In Grafana, add the API URL as a data source:
   - Go to **Configuration** > **Data Sources** > **Add Data Source**.
   - Select **JSON API** (if it's not available, you may need to install the JSON API plugin first).
   - Set the URL to the API endpoint, e.g., `https://api.rss2json.com/v1/api.json?rss_url=<YOUR-RSS-FEED>`.
   
3. **Visualize the RSS feed** in a **Table** or **Text Panel**:
   - Create a new panel and select the data source pointing to your RSS feed.
   - Configure the table to display the feed title, date, and description.

#### Option 2: Write a Simple Python Script

If you prefer a local solution:
- Write a Python script to convert RSS feeds to JSON and expose it via a simple web server (Flask or FastAPI).
- Use Grafana’s **JSON data source** to fetch the parsed RSS feed.

### Step 3: Configure Public Access (No Authentication)

To make your dashboard publicly accessible without requiring authentication, follow these steps:

1. **Disable Authentication for the Dashboard**:
   - Open your Grafana configuration file (`/etc/grafana/grafana.ini` or similar, depending on your installation).
   - Locate the `[auth.anonymous]` section and enable anonymous access:
     ```ini
     [auth.anonymous]
     enabled = true
     org_name = Main Org.
     org_role = Viewer
     ```
   - This configuration will allow users to view dashboards without needing to log in.

2. **Restrict Public Access to Specific Dashboards Only**:
   - You can create an organization specifically for public users and assign **Viewer** permissions to prevent unwanted changes.
   - Configure dashboard permissions by going to the **Dashboard Settings** > **Permissions** section and ensuring public users only have **Viewer** access.

### Step 4: Harden Security by Separating the Login Path

Even if you allow public access to the dashboards, it’s still a good idea to secure the login process.

1. **Use a Reverse Proxy** (such as Nginx) to Hide the Login Page:
   - You can proxy Grafana through Nginx and create a separate URL for login, effectively hiding the standard `/login` path.
   
   Example Nginx configuration to separate login:
   ```nginx
   server {
       listen 80;
       server_name yourdomain.com;

       location /grafana/ {
           proxy_pass http://localhost:3000/;
       }

       location /secret-login/ {
           proxy_pass http://localhost:3000/login;
       }

       # Disable direct access to /login
       location /login {
           return 404;
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Enable SSL (HTTPS)**:
   - If you’re using a public-facing Grafana instance, it’s crucial to enable SSL.
   - Use **Let’s Encrypt** or another certificate authority to secure your Grafana instance via HTTPS.

3. **Limit Admin Access**:
   - In `grafana.ini`, ensure admin access is tightly controlled:
     ```ini
     [security]
     admin_password = strongpassword
     ```

### Step 5: Automate Data Updates

If you’re pulling data from external sources like RSS feeds or APIs, consider automating updates:
   - Set **refresh intervals** in Grafana so that the dashboard pulls new data at regular intervals.
   - For example, every 5 minutes:
     ```ini
     [dashboards]
     update_interval = 300
     ```

### Step 6: Test & Finalize the Dashboard

- Test the dashboard with a public URL, ensuring everything is working as expected.
- If needed, tweak your panels and data sources for better visualization.
- Keep monitoring for security vulnerabilities and update Grafana regularly.

This setup will give you a news monitoring dashboard that's publicly accessible, with some basic security measures in place to protect the login process. You can further refine the security based on the sensitivity of your data and adjust how Grafana fetches and visualizes the news content.
