Yes, putting the login path behind Cloudflare Access is a robust strategy, and configuring a different login path can add an extra layer of security. Here’s a breakdown of how these approaches work together and why it could be beneficial:

1. Cloudflare Zero Trust Access for Login Path:

Using Cloudflare Access (Zero Trust) to protect the login path of your Grafana instance adds a powerful security layer. Cloudflare Access requires users to authenticate through Cloudflare before they even reach the Grafana login page, reducing the risk of brute force login attempts.

You can use OAuth, SAML, or MFA as part of Cloudflare’s authentication process, creating a multi-layered defense mechanism.

This protection ensures that attackers are unlikely to get past the Cloudflare barrier, significantly reducing the chances of brute force attacks targeting your Grafana login.


2. Separation of Login and Public Dashboard Access:

With the login path protected, public users can still access your read-only dashboards without authentication. This allows you to keep public dashboards accessible without compromising security since attackers won’t be able to target your login page directly.

The login page is effectively shielded behind Cloudflare’s defenses, adding a robust security barrier without affecting the usability of your public dashboards.


3. Robustness of Cloudflare Zero Trust:

Cloudflare’s global infrastructure provides excellent protection against brute force, credential stuffing, and DDoS attacks. By requiring users to authenticate through Cloudflare Access before reaching the login page, you’re leveraging Cloudflare’s security features, which include DDoS mitigation, rate limiting, and global redundancy.

Attackers would have to bypass Cloudflare before they could even attempt to brute force the Grafana login, making it significantly more difficult to target your system.


4. Configuring a Different Login Path:

Why it helps: Changing the default login path (e.g., from /login to something like /securelogin123) is a form of security through obscurity. While this isn't the most secure method on its own, it adds an extra layer of difficulty for attackers because they would have to discover the correct login path before launching any attack.

How it works with Cloudflare: Even with the login page hidden, brute force attacks may still happen if attackers guess or discover the new path. However, with Cloudflare Access on top, they would still be blocked by Cloudflare’s authentication before reaching the actual Grafana login.

Pros of changing the login path: It helps prevent automated attacks, such as bots or scripts targeting the common login page at /login. Attackers would need to find the new path first, which isn't impossible, but it adds a layer of complexity.

Cons: Configuring a different login path is mainly effective against unsophisticated or automated attacks. Sophisticated attackers may still find the path through indirect means (e.g., exposed logs, referrers). So while it’s a good practice, it should not be relied upon as the sole security measure.


5. Additional Security Measures:

Rate Limiting: With Cloudflare’s rate limiting, you can also ensure that even if an attacker discovers the new login path, they won’t be able to brute force it effectively because of the restricted number of login attempts.

Auditing: Using Cloudflare’s detailed logging, you can monitor and review login attempts and access patterns, giving you insights into potential threats.


Conclusion:

Configuring Cloudflare Zero Trust Access for your Grafana login path is a robust defense mechanism, greatly reducing the likelihood of brute force attempts. Adding a different login path on top of this can further enhance security by obscuring the entry point, especially against automated attacks. While the alternative login path isn’t foolproof on its own, it works well as part of a broader, layered security strategy when combined with Cloudflare's advanced security controls.
