Here are several prompt templates that can be used with DALLE to generate images based on an uploaded image as context. These prompts are designed to guide the AI to focus on the key characteristics of the uploaded image while allowing you to adjust the style, setting, or scenario:

### 1. **Simple Context Matching**
   - “Create an image based on the uploaded photo. The generated image should feature [specific details or traits from the uploaded image], and place it in a [describe setting] environment. Make sure to preserve the [mention specific features like colors, textures, expressions, etc.] from the original image.”
   - **Example**: "Create an image based on the uploaded photo of a stuffed sloth. The generated image should feature the same sloth with light grayish-brown fur and brown patches around the eyes, in a lush jungle setting."

### 2. **Changing the Environment**
   - "Generate an image using the uploaded [object/character] from the image as the subject. Keep its appearance intact, but place it in [describe environment, e.g., a futuristic city, a beach, outer space, etc.]. Ensure the object/character maintains its key traits, such as [specific feature like color, size, texture]."
   - **Example**: "Generate an image using the uploaded stuffed animal. Keep its cute, fluffy appearance intact, but place it in a snowy landscape with aurora lights in the sky."

### 3. **Creating an Action Scene**
   - "Based on the uploaded image, create a new scene where the [object/character] is performing [specific action or activity]. Ensure the [object/character's] features remain consistent with the original photo, especially [specific features such as colors, expressions, clothing, etc.]."
   - **Example**: "Based on the uploaded image of the sloth, create a new scene where the sloth is riding a bicycle through a colorful park. Ensure the sloth’s face, fur, and clothing are consistent with the original image."

### 4. **Stylizing the Uploaded Image**
   - "Use the uploaded image as inspiration and generate a version of it in [specific art style, e.g., watercolor, cyberpunk, impressionism, etc.]. Keep the [object/character] from the image recognizable, maintaining [specific key details], but apply the new style to the entire scene."
   - **Example**: "Use the uploaded photo of the sloth and generate a version of it in a watercolor painting style. Keep the sloth’s expression and fur texture intact while making the background and surroundings vibrant and artistic."

### 5. **Expanding the Scene**
   - "Use the uploaded image as the main focus and expand the scene around it. Add [specific elements, such as a background, additional objects, people, or animals], but ensure the [object/character] remains the central focus with its original features unchanged."
   - **Example**: "Use the uploaded sloth image as the central focus and expand the scene by adding a jungle background with trees, birds, and other animals. Make sure the sloth’s colors and textures remain as they are in the original image."

### 6. **Historical or Futuristic Version**
   - "Take the [object/character] from the uploaded image and imagine it in a [past/future] setting. Change the background and surrounding elements to match the [specific time period or future concept], but keep the main subject’s appearance true to the original."
   - **Example**: "Take the sloth from the uploaded image and imagine it in a futuristic city with flying cars and holograms. Keep the sloth’s appearance, fur texture, and expression consistent with the original."

### 7. **Seasonal or Holiday-Themed**
   - "Generate an image of the [object/character] from the uploaded photo, but in a [specific holiday or season, like Christmas, Halloween, or winter] theme. Ensure the main subject retains its original look while the environment reflects the holiday/seasonal theme."
   - **Example**: "Generate an image of the stuffed sloth from the uploaded photo, but in a winter holiday theme, with snow, a cozy sweater, and holiday decorations in the background."

### 8. **Surreal or Fantasy Setting**
   - "Create a surreal or fantasy version of the uploaded image where the [object/character] is placed in an imaginative setting, like [underwater world, fantasy kingdom, dreamscape]. Keep the character’s primary features consistent but adjust the surrounding elements to fit the fantasy setting."
   - **Example**: "Create a fantasy version of the sloth from the uploaded image, placing it in a magical forest with glowing plants and floating islands. Keep the sloth’s fur and facial details the same as in the original."

### How to Use These Templates:
- **Replace** the placeholders (e.g., [object/character], [specific details], [setting]) with the details relevant to your uploaded image.
- **Maintain** the original features of the uploaded image that you want to keep consistent, while allowing the AI to adjust the environment or style according to your preferences.
