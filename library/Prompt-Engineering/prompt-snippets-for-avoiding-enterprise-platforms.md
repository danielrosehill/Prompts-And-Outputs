To help refine your stack research prompts to avoid companies out of your budget, especially those targeting enterprises or those with opaque pricing models, you can add prompts that explicitly signal cost sensitivity and filter by specific price criteria. Here are some snippet suggestions to add:

### General Filtering
1. **Budget-Conscious Suggestions**:
   - "Please recommend solutions that are **affordable for individual users or small teams** rather than large enterprises."
   - "Focus on options that are **transparent about their pricing** and avoid companies that use quote-based pricing only."

2. **Pricing Transparency Emphasis**:
   - "Include tools that have **public pricing tiers** or flat rates. Avoid companies that primarily target enterprise clients with custom or quote-only pricing."
   - "I’m specifically interested in services that have a **free tier or an entry-level plan under $X per month**."

3. **Avoiding Enterprise-Only Solutions**:
   - "Filter out companies that explicitly market themselves as **enterprise solutions** or cater exclusively to **Fortune 500 clients**."
   - "Avoid any providers whose main customer base seems to be **enterprise-level corporations**."

4. **Focus on SMB Solutions**:
   - "Target platforms that are suitable for **small to medium-sized businesses (SMBs)** or individuals, as opposed to large-scale enterprise solutions."

### Pricing-Related Criteria
5. **Avoid Opaque Pricing**:
   - "Please exclude solutions that have **custom pricing** models or require contacting sales for quotes."
   - "Only include options that clearly list their **pricing plans on their website** without requiring sales inquiries."

6. **Cost-Efficiency Focus**:
   - "Prioritize platforms that have **fixed pricing plans** and indicate cost-efficiency for individual users."
   - "Filter by solutions with **tiered pricing**, excluding those that indicate pricing is primarily negotiable or quote-based."

7. **Free Tier or Affordable Entry-Level**:
   - "Highlight services that have either a **free tier** or a **starting price below $50 per month**."
   - "Exclude any service where the only way to get a quote or price is by engaging with their sales team."

### Specific Wording for Prompts
8. **Budget Guidance Signals**:
   - "I want to focus on providers that are suitable for **startups, freelancers, or small businesses** rather than large enterprise-focused software vendors."
   - "Do not include vendors where **pricing starts only with a custom contract** or **annual commitments** exceeding $1,000."

9. **Scalability and Accessibility**:
   - "Please suggest scalable solutions, but limit suggestions to those that are **affordable for early-stage users** and clearly **show monthly or pay-as-you-go options**."
   - "Exclude companies known for primarily working with organizations that have **thousands of employees** or **complex procurement processes**."

### Example Prompt Usage
Here's an example of a stack research prompt with these criteria integrated:

> "I am looking for knowledge management tools that are cost-effective for individuals or small teams. Please **avoid solutions with quote-only pricing** or those specifically aimed at large enterprises. **Pricing transparency** is key—I'd like to see options where **pricing is clearly available** and where a **free tier or an entry-level plan under $50/month** is available. Exclude any providers that require **custom quotes or annual contracts with high minimums**."

These snippets should help keep the research focused on more accessible, budget-friendly options and avoid wasting time on vendors that don’t fit your needs or budget. Feel free to adjust these snippets to emphasize any particular points!
