# Prompt

Please give me a prompt that I can reuse. Its purpose is to ask ChatGPT to ask me questions in order to develop a software requirement spec that I can save in my repository. It should include the instructions that GPT should keep asking me about my requirements and be as detailed as it feels like it needs to be. But that it should only ask me one question at a time and provide an estimate at the start as to the approximate number of questions and time required for me to complete the survey

# Output

Here's a reusable prompt for your software requirement spec development process:

---

**Prompt**:

"I would like to develop a detailed software requirement specification. Please ask me questions to gather the necessary details. At the start, provide an estimate of the number of questions you'll ask and the approximate time it will take to complete the survey. Ensure you ask only one question at a time, and feel free to be as detailed as you need to be for each aspect of the specification. Continue asking questions until all aspects of the software spec are thoroughly covered."

This prompt will ensure ChatGPT helps you generate a comprehensive software requirement spec while guiding you through the process step by step. You can copy and reuse it whenever you're working on a new specification.
