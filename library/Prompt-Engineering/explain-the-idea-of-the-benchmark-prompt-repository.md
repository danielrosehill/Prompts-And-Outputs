*Note: this repository consists of the outputs of large language models (LLMs). In many cases, these are unedited or minimally edited. The information provided is for demonstrative purposes only and is intended to highlight constraints and capabilities in LLM applications and prompt engineering strategies.*


# Prompt

I would like to release my library of evaluation prompts (to be used for LLM comparison and evaluation publicly). Can you suggest a few names for the repository and simple descriptions to explain its purpose? Give me 10 of each. 

# Output

### Repository Name Ideas:
1. **LLM Benchmark Prompts**
2. **PromptBench for LLMs**
3. **LLM Task Evaluator**
4. **PromptCompare**
5. **EvalPrompts**
6. **ModelMatch Prompts**
7. **TaskPrompts Hub**
8. **LLM Test Drive**
9. **PromptLab for LLMs**
10. **LLM Evaluation Suite**

### Simple Descriptions:
1. A library of evaluation prompts designed to compare LLMs for specific use cases.
2. Standardized prompts to assess LLM performance across various tasks.
3. A collection of prompts for benchmarking LLMs in targeted workflows.
4. Evaluate and compare LLMs with a curated set of task-specific prompts.
5. A tool for LLM testing and model comparison using carefully designed prompts.
6. A repository of task-based prompts to streamline LLM evaluations.
7. Prompts for evaluating LLM performance across diverse tasks and applications.
8. A prompt library to help identify the best LLM for specific tasks.
9. A testing ground for comparing LLM outputs on specialized use cases.
10. A public repository of prompts for LLM benchmarking and comparison.
