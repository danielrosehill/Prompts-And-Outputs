Please provide some ideas for DALLE images that I could create leveraging a sloth and some of these complementary themes:

- Jerusalem
- AI technology
- A computer experimentation lab

Please provide a prompt template for each idea. Assume that the prompts will be delivered via ChatGPT so you'll need to start each one with the necessary instruction for image generation.
