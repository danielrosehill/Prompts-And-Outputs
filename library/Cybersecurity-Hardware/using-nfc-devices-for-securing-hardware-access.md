# Prompt

Is it possible to use NFC to authenticate secure access to a Fedora workstation and if so what type of NFC device would be commonly used for this purpose?

# output

Yes, it is possible to use **NFC** (Near Field Communication) for secure authentication on a **Fedora workstation**. This setup can be configured to allow login access using NFC cards, tags, or devices. Here's how it generally works:

### Common NFC Devices for Authentication:
1. **NFC Smart Cards**: Similar to ID cards, often used for physical access control and can be configured for workstation login.
2. **YubiKey (NFC models)**: Multi-factor authentication (MFA) devices that support NFC. Can store certificates or act as a security key for authentication.
3. **NFC Tags**: While less secure, simple NFC tags can be used in conjunction with PIN codes for two-factor authentication.

### How It Works:
1. **Configure PAM (Pluggable Authentication Module)**: Modify the system to recognize NFC device interactions as part of the login process.
2. **Software Integration**: Use software like `libnfc`, `pam_nfc`, or `pam_u2f` for handling NFC interactions securely.
3. **Setup Keys/Credentials**: Load security keys or certificates on the NFC device.

This approach is particularly beneficial for enhancing physical security and adding an additional layer of authentication.
