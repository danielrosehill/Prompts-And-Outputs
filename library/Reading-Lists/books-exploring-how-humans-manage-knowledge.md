**Prompt Summary:** The user requested book suggestions that provide perspectives on how humans have used technology to manage the growing repository of human knowledge, as well as various approaches devised to structure the increasingly interconnected global knowledge.

Here are some insightful books that explore the evolution of knowledge management and technology’s role in structuring human knowledge:

1. **"The Information: A History, a Theory, a Flood" by James Gleick** – This book covers the history of information, tracing how data and knowledge have been managed from early human communication to modern digital technologies. It explores how the information explosion has reshaped society and how humans have developed ways to process vast amounts of information.

2. **"The Shallows: What the Internet Is Doing to Our Brains" by Nicholas Carr** – Carr examines the cognitive and structural impacts of the internet on human knowledge. The book reflects on how digital platforms alter how we think and process information, affecting knowledge organization on both personal and global scales.

3. **"Too Big to Know: Rethinking Knowledge Now That the Facts Aren't the Facts, Experts Are Everywhere, and the Smartest Person in the Room Is the Room" by David Weinberger** – Weinberger argues that the nature of knowledge has fundamentally changed, with the internet connecting everything and everyone. This book explores how knowledge can now be more decentralized and how digital tools shape interconnected knowledge management.

4. **"The Order of Things: An Archaeology of the Human Sciences" by Michel Foucault** – Although not technology-focused, this classic examines how societies structure knowledge and categorize information. Foucault’s work provides context on how technological methods have influenced the ways knowledge is perceived and managed across different eras.

5. **"How to Fix the Future" by Andrew Keen** – Keen takes a historical view of innovation and the handling of information in response to technological shifts. He emphasizes that learning from the past can guide how we manage technology-driven knowledge systems and ensure they remain aligned with human goals.

6. **"The Knowledge Illusion: Why We Never Think Alone" by Steven Sloman and Philip Fernbach** – This book discusses the collective nature of knowledge and how understanding has become a shared, interconnected experience enhanced by technology. It considers how we rely on communal resources and tools to manage a seemingly infinite amount of information.

7. **"The Googlization of Everything (And Why We Should Worry)" by Siva Vaidhyanathan** – Focusing on how Google influences knowledge access and organization, Vaidhyanathan explores what happens when one company largely shapes the global repository of human knowledge, raising questions about curation, control, and the user experience of information.

8. **"From Gutenberg to Google: Electronic Representations of Literary Texts" by Peter L. Shillingsburg** – This book traces the journey of written knowledge from the printing press to the digital era, providing a look at how electronic texts and digital media have transformed information accessibility and the organization of literary knowledge.

9. **"Code and Other Laws of Cyberspace" by Lawrence Lessig** – Lessig addresses the legal and structural aspects of digital knowledge management, considering how the internet and code create frameworks that define knowledge accessibility and organization, with implications for the global knowledge economy.

10. **"Libraries of the Future" by J.C.R. Licklider** – This visionary work predicted the transformation of libraries into digital repositories and considers the potential of technology to manage vast amounts of information. Licklider’s insights still resonate, especially with the rise of digital archiving and artificial intelligence in knowledge management.

These books provide diverse perspectives on how technology shapes our understanding, organization, and usage of knowledge, helping to build an appreciation for the evolution and challenges of managing a continuously expanding global knowledge base.
