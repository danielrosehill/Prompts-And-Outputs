# Prompt

Wow. Very expensive. 
Are there any middle ground solutions that are perhaps half way solutions between using limited web UIs (no offense, chatGPT!) and having to rent out very expensive hardware?
Again, my objective is to find a streamlined way to be able to use a capable LLM via a conversational frontend but to save the outputs (and my inputs) in a database that I manage. I can't achieve the last of these using ChatGPT. Any suggestions?

# Output

You're right — self-hosting high-end models like GPT-3.5 or GPT-4 can be costly. But there are **middle-ground solutions** that balance performance, cost, and control, allowing you to use capable language models while managing outputs and inputs in your own database.

### 1. **OpenAI API with Custom Frontend and Database Integration**

You can still leverage the power of GPT-4 or GPT-3.5 via **OpenAI’s API**, but instead of building a heavy infrastructure, you could run a **custom frontend** that interacts with their API. This keeps costs low because you're only paying for usage instead of running a GPU 24/7. You can build a custom system that stores your inputs and outputs in a local or cloud-managed database.

- **API Costs**: OpenAI’s API costs are based on usage, e.g., GPT-4 can be around **$0.02 per 1,000 tokens**. You can control your costs by using throttling or specific limits.
- **Frontend**: Use a lightweight conversational UI (e.g., **Gradio**, **Streamlit**, or even custom-built web apps) to communicate with the API.
- **Database**: You can store all user interactions (both inputs and outputs) in a **PostgreSQL** or **MySQL** database hosted on affordable cloud infrastructure (AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL, etc.).
  
This is an excellent way to balance cost and performance, and gives you control over data storage, while leveraging the most powerful LLMs.

**Estimated Costs:**
- **OpenAI API**: You pay only for what you use. Monthly costs for moderate use could range from **$100 to $500**, depending on traffic.
- **Cloud Database**: Around **$50–$100/month** for storage (AWS RDS or equivalent).
- **Frontend Hosting**: Using a small **EC2 instance** on AWS or a **DigitalOcean Droplet** for your web UI would be relatively cheap ($5–$20 per month).
- **Total Estimated Cost**: **$150–$600/month** depending on usage.

### 2. **Run a Smaller Open-Source Model in the Cloud (e.g., GPT-J, GPT-Neo)**
If you’re willing to compromise slightly on model capability (still very capable but not quite GPT-3.5), you could run smaller open-source models like **GPT-J-6B** or **GPT-Neo-2.7B** on more affordable cloud GPU instances, or even CPU-only instances (though slower).

- **Model**: GPT-J-6B or GPT-NeoX, both capable models that are less demanding than GPT-3.5.
- **Frontend**: You can use a **Gradio**-based or **Streamlit**-based conversational interface, just like ChatGPT, but entirely self-hosted.
- **Database**: As with the OpenAI API approach, you can store all user inputs and outputs in a cloud-hosted database (AWS, Google Cloud, DigitalOcean).

#### Hosting on More Affordable Hardware:
You could run these models on **smaller cloud instances**, such as:
- **AWS EC2 G4 Instances**: These instances are equipped with **NVIDIA T4 GPUs**. They are much more affordable than A100 instances, costing around **$0.53/hour**.
- **Paperspace** or **Lambda Labs**: These offer **NVIDIA A10** or **RTX GPUs**, which are much more cost-efficient than A100s.

**Estimated Costs**:
- **Cloud Instance**: For smaller models, you can run them on GPUs that cost around **$0.5–$1.5 per hour**, so moderate use might come to around **$500–$1,000 per month**.
- **Database**: Around **$50–$100/month** for storing input/output data.
- **Frontend Hosting**: **$5–$20/month** for a small instance or managed hosting.
- **Total Estimated Cost**: **$600–$1,200/month**.

### 3. **Hybrid Solution: Use Pre-Trained API with Caching and Rerun Locally**
Another option is using a hybrid approach where:
- You leverage **OpenAI's API** for initial inferences but save all inputs and outputs in a local **database** (e.g., **PostgreSQL**).
- You **cache responses** from the API, allowing you to avoid repetitive calls and reduce costs significantly.
- Later, you could implement **local inferencing** for certain use cases using a smaller open-source model like **GPT-J** for cached responses or simpler tasks.

This can help optimize the costs, as you’re only querying the more expensive API when necessary, and you can rerun locally when appropriate.

**Estimated Costs**:
- **OpenAI API**: Minimal calls due to caching could reduce costs to **$100–$300/month**.
- **Cloud Instance for Caching/Serving**: A moderate GPU instance for occasional use (similar to Paperspace/Lambda) or CPU-only cloud instance for cached response generation, costing around **$50–$100/month**.
- **Total Estimated Cost**: **$150–$400/month** depending on how often the API is used.

### 4. **Managed LLM Services with Web UI and Storage Integration**
Some platforms offer LLM APIs with managed infrastructure that you can extend with your own database. These often have more affordable pricing tiers than running your own cloud GPU infrastructure.

#### Examples:
1. **Cohere**: Offers high-performance language models with API access at a lower cost than OpenAI, and you can integrate your own UI and database.
   - **Cost**: Plans start at **$50/month**, scaling with usage. You can still use your database to store the interactions.
   - **Pros**: Lower API costs, fully managed infrastructure, straightforward integration.

2. **Replicate.com**: Allows you to deploy AI models (including open-source LLMs) with minimal setup, and they provide a billing model based on usage.
   - **Cost**: You only pay for inference, starting as low as **$0.02 per minute**.
   - **Pros**: Cost-efficient, simple deployment, and integrates well with databases for storing inputs/outputs.

**Total Estimated Cost for Managed Services**: **$50–$300/month** depending on the number of queries.

### Summary of Middle-Ground Solutions:
- **OpenAI API with Custom Frontend**: Cost-effective for lighter usage, with total monthly costs of **$150–$600/month**. You can use a database to store all inputs and outputs.
- **Open-Source Model on Cloud GPUs (GPT-J or GPT-Neo)**: A bit more resource-intensive but offers more control and flexibility, costing around **$600–$1,200/month**.
- **Hybrid API + Local Caching**: Uses OpenAI for expensive tasks but caches data for repeated use, lowering costs to **$150–$400/month**.
- **Managed LLM Services (Cohere, Replicate)**: Starting at **$50/month** for low-usage plans.

### Recommendations:
- If you want flexibility with lower costs and control over your data, **OpenAI API with a custom UI** storing data in your own database would be the most straightforward and cost-efficient solution.
- If you’re willing to compromise on model size, running **GPT-J or GPT-Neo** on a smaller GPU instance will offer lower long-term costs while still allowing self-hosting.
