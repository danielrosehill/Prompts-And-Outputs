Yes, there are several low-code tools that support graph databases, allowing users to work with complex data structures and relationships without extensive coding. Here are a few options:

1\. **Neo4j Bloom**: Neo4j, one of the most popular graph databases, offers Neo4j Bloom, a low-code, visual exploration tool that allows users to interact with graph data. It provides an intuitive interface for querying and visualizing graph data, making it easier for non-technical users to work with graph databases.

2\. **Graphistry**: This is a visual graph analytics platform that integrates with various graph databases like Neo4j and AWS Neptune. It allows users to create and explore graph visualizations with minimal coding, making it suitable for low-code environments.

3\. **ArangoDB Oasis**: ArangoDB is a multi-model database that includes graph database capabilities. ArangoDB Oasis is its managed service, offering a web-based interface that simplifies database management and query building, which can be considered low-code.

4\. **MindsDB**: While MindsDB is primarily focused on automated machine learning (AutoML), it supports integrations with graph databases like Neo4j. It allows users to build predictive models using graph data with minimal coding.

5\. **Retool**: Retool is a low-code platform for building internal tools that can connect to various databases, including graph databases like Neo4j. While Retool itself is not a graph database, it allows users to build applications that interact with graph data through its intuitive interface.

6\. **Low-code platforms with GraphQL support**: Some low-code platforms like **Hasura** and **8base** use GraphQL, which can interface with graph databases. These platforms allow you to build applications on top of graph databases using low-code approaches.

These tools help bridge the gap between complex graph database technology and non-technical users or developers looking for quicker ways to work with graph data.
