# Prompt

Do I need to edit the default Postgres config to allow grafana (on the server) to connect with the db? I don't require external access?

# Output

If you only need Grafana (running on the same server as PostgreSQL) to connect to the database without requiring external access, you may not need to make significant changes to the default PostgreSQL configuration. However, here are some considerations:

### 1. Default Configuration

- By default, PostgreSQL is configured to allow connections from localhost (i.e., connections originating from the same server). This means that as long as Grafana is running on the same machine as PostgreSQL, it should be able to connect without additional configuration changes.
  
### 2. `pg_hba.conf` Configuration

- The `pg_hba.conf` file controls client authentication. You should ensure that it allows local connections. The default setup typically includes a line for local connections like this:
  ```plaintext
  # TYPE  DATABASE        USER            ADDRESS                 METHOD
  local   all             all                                     peer
  ```
- If this line is present, you should be able to connect to the database as the `grafana` user without issues.

### 3. Verify Connection Settings

If you run into any issues while connecting, you can check:

- **`listen_addresses`**: In the `postgresql.conf` file, it should be set to `localhost` (or left commented out):
  ```plaintext
  listen_addresses = 'localhost'
  ```
- **Restart PostgreSQL**: If you make any changes to configuration files, be sure to restart PostgreSQL:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl restart postgresql
  ```

### Conclusion

For a setup that only involves local connections, the default PostgreSQL configuration is usually sufficient. Always ensure that the appropriate lines in `pg_hba.conf` are correctly set for local connections.
