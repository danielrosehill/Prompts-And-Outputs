*Note: this repository consists of the outputs of large language models (LLMs). In many cases, these are unedited or minimally edited. The information provided is for demonstrative purposes only and is intended to highlight constraints and capabilities in LLM applications and prompt engineering strategies.*


# Prompt
Please analyse this DDL which contains the latest database model for Output Hub which is what I've renamed GPT workbench to. Can you please attempt to create a folder structure model for Obsidian that would replicate as much of that functionality as possible? Feel free to use educated guesses to fill in gaps or to create additional ways of relating data. And in your output please provide me with a comprehensive folder skeleton that I can use in my Obsidian notebook, taking care to avoid spaces for the reasons we've just discussed

# Output

The SQL file you've provided appears to define a database schema with multiple tables, each designed to store various types of data related to "Output Hub." The schema includes tables like `accessui`, `accuracylevels`, `actionability_levels`, `activitystatus`, and `agentgroups`. These tables have fields for storing different aspects of user interactions, data accuracy, actionability levels, statuses, and more.

### Analyzing the DDL for Folder Structure Design in Obsidian

Given that you're aiming to replicate this functionality within Obsidian, I'll map these database tables and their purposes to a folder structure that can organize similar information in a markdown-based system like Obsidian. 

### **Proposed Obsidian Folder Structure for "Output Hub"**

#### **Root Folder: `Output_Hub`**
This is the main folder where all your LLM-related interactions and data will be stored.

#### **Subfolder: `Metadata`**
- **Purpose**: To store metadata definitions and related notes, akin to lookup tables in your database.
- **Structure**:
  - `Metadata/AccessUI` – Corresponds to the `accessui` table; stores different UI access levels.
  - `Metadata/AccuracyLevels` – Corresponds to the `accuracylevels` table; defines levels of accuracy.
  - `Metadata/ActionabilityLevels` – Corresponds to the `actionability_levels` table; defines levels of actionability.
  - `Metadata/ActivityStatus` – Corresponds to the `activitystatus` table; stores possible activity statuses.
  - `Metadata/AgentGroups` – Corresponds to the `agentgroups` table; defines groups of agents.
  - `Metadata/APIIntegrations` – Stores API integration configurations and notes.
  - `Metadata/LLM_Types` – New category to define and store types of LLMs and their characteristics.

#### **Subfolder: `Prompts`**
- **Purpose**: To store all prompts used in interactions.
- **Structure**:
  - `Prompts/Active` – Prompts currently in use.
  - `Prompts/Archived` – Older prompts no longer in use.
  - `Prompts/Templates` – Reusable prompt templates.
  - `Prompts/Ideas` – Brainstorming and storing new prompt ideas.

#### **Subfolder: `Outputs`**
- **Purpose**: To store the outputs generated by various LLMs.
- **Structure**:
  - `Outputs/By_Date` – Organize outputs by date.
  - `Outputs/By_Project` – Organize outputs by specific projects or topics.
  - `Outputs/Favorites` – Store your favorite or most useful outputs.

#### **Subfolder: `Assessments`**
- **Purpose**: To assess the quality, accuracy, and actionability of outputs.
- **Structure**:
  - `Assessments/Accuracy_Reports` – Corresponds to `accuracylevels`; store reports assessing accuracy.
  - `Assessments/Actionability_Reports` – Corresponds to `actionability_levels`; store reports assessing actionability.
  - `Assessments/Feedback` – Store feedback and evaluations of outputs.

#### **Subfolder: `Logs`**
- **Purpose**: To track and log interactions with LLMs.
- **Structure**:
  - `Logs/Daily` – Keep a daily log of interactions.
  - `Logs/Session` – Log individual sessions, possibly by project or focus.
  - `Logs/Error_Reports` – Track any issues or errors encountered during interactions.

#### **Subfolder: `Projects`**
- **Purpose**: To organize interactions and outputs by specific projects.
- **Structure**:
  - `Projects/Project_Name` – Each project has its folder containing related prompts, outputs, assessments, and logs.

#### **Subfolder: `References`**
- **Purpose**: To store references, research, or any background information related to LLM interactions.
- **Structure**:
  - `References/Articles` – Save articles or research notes.
  - `References/Books` – Store book notes or summaries.
  - `References/Websites` – Collect useful links.
  - `References/LLM_Research` – Specific to LLM-related research and developments.

### **Additional Considerations**

- **Linking Data**: Use Obsidian's internal linking feature to connect prompts to outputs, assessments, and related metadata. This will mimic relational database functionality by providing context and traceability.
  
- **Tagging**: Implement a tagging system (e.g., `#accuracy`, `#actionable`, `#in_progress`, `#archived`) to further categorize and filter your notes.

- **Automation**: Utilize Obsidian plugins like Templater and QuickAdd to automate note creation, ensuring consistent organization and ease of data entry.

This folder structure is designed to replicate as much of the database functionality as possible within the Obsidian environment, leveraging its strengths in linking, tagging, and markdown-based content management.## Extracted Prompts
