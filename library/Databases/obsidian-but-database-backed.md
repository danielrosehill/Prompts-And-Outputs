# Prompt

consider a note taking app like Obsidian. Can you think of any tools like it that instead of storing notes as markdown files store them natively in a database? Only consider apps that can be self hosted or fully backed up

# Output
Here are a few tools similar to Obsidian that store notes natively in a database and can be self-hosted or fully backed up:

1. **Joplin**: While Joplin typically stores notes as markdown files, it also offers the option to use a database backend when syncing with certain services like Nextcloud. Joplin can be self-hosted, and all data can be fully backed up.

2. **Standard Notes**: This is a privacy-focused note-taking app that encrypts your notes and stores them in a database. You can self-host Standard Notes using their server setup, and it also supports full backups.

3. **TiddlyWiki**: TiddlyWiki is an open-source, self-hostable wiki tool that can be set up to use a database for storing notes. Although it traditionally uses a single HTML file, with plugins, you can configure it to work with various backends, including databases.

4. **Notabase**: Notabase is a self-hostable note-taking app that stores notes in a SQLite database. It offers a similar note-linking and graph view feature like Obsidian. Notabase can be fully backed up by exporting the SQLite database.

5. **Trilium Notes**: Trilium is an open-source hierarchical note-taking app with a rich feature set. It stores notes in a database and can be self-hosted. It supports automatic daily backups and encrypted note storage.

6. **AppFlowy**: Although still in development, AppFlowy is an open-source alternative to Notion, which stores notes and data in a database. It offers self-hosting options and aims to provide full data control, including backups.

These tools should provide a good balance between the functionality of a note-taking app like Obsidian and the benefits of database-backed storage.## Extracted Prompts
