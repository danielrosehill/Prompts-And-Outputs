# Prompt

Are there any note taking or KM tools which already natively integrate with Neo and can be self hosted? Alternatively, are there any DB-agnostic KM tools that could be easily integrated?

# Output
There aren’t many note-taking or KM tools that natively integrate with Neo4j and are self-hostable, but a few flexible, database-agnostic options could be integrated with Neo4j (or any graph database) with some customization. Here are some tools in both categories:

### 1. **Joplin with Neo4j Integration (via Plugins or API)**
   - **Overview**: Joplin is an open-source, Markdown-based note-taking app that is self-hostable and supports tagging, notebooks, and plugins.
   - **Neo4j Integration**: While Joplin doesn’t natively integrate with Neo4j, its API allows access to notes, which can then be imported into Neo4j with a custom script. You could write a script to sync Joplin notes with Neo4j as nodes, with tags as relationships.
   - **Self-Hosting**: Joplin has a server mode for self-hosting, making it a convenient choice for local or server-based KM.
   - **Pros**: Secure, privacy-friendly, and open-source with robust Markdown support. With Neo4j integration via API, it can provide a semi-automated syncing solution.
   - **Limitations**: Requires custom scripting to establish and maintain Neo4j integration.

### 2. **Logseq (DB-Agnostic, Supports API Extensions)**
   - **Overview**: Logseq is an open-source, Markdown-based tool that supports a networked structure with bidirectional links and a graph view, suitable for knowledge management.
   - **Neo4j Integration**: Logseq is not tied to a specific database and is compatible with both local files and Git-based syncing. Its plugin architecture can support Neo4j integration via custom API scripts, allowing you to push notes and relationships to Neo4j.
   - **Self-Hosting**: While primarily local-first, Logseq can be configured to run on a web server with Git-based storage.
   - **Pros**: Flexible and script-friendly, with a plugin architecture that can facilitate Neo4j integration.
   - **Limitations**: Currently requires manual setup for Neo4j integration, with limited automation out of the box.

### 3. **Trilium Notes with Custom Neo4j Sync**
   - **Overview**: Trilium Notes is an open-source, hierarchical note-taking app with bidirectional linking and tagging, well-suited for knowledge management.
   - **Neo4j Integration**: Trilium doesn’t natively integrate with Neo4j, but it offers an API that makes it possible to sync or export notes and relationships to Neo4j. A script could automate the creation of Neo4j nodes and relationships based on Trilium’s note structure.
   - **Self-Hosting**: Trilium can be easily self-hosted, as it’s designed to run on local servers and is Docker-friendly.
   - **Pros**: Trilium’s API and structured note-taking make it suitable for integration with graph databases like Neo4j.
   - **Limitations**: Requires scripting for full Neo4j sync, and while it supports relationships, it’s hierarchical rather than a full graph.

### 4. **Dendron (Markdown-Based with API Access)**
   - **Overview**: Dendron is a Markdown-based knowledge management system that works locally but can be hosted and configured with Git-based syncing.
   - **Neo4j Integration**: Dendron doesn’t directly support Neo4j, but it can export Markdown files and metadata, which can then be processed with custom scripts to import into Neo4j.
   - **Self-Hosting**: Primarily local-first, but can be hosted via GitHub Pages or with a static site generator for online access.
   - **Pros**: Database-agnostic and can be integrated with Neo4j via export scripts. It’s especially useful if your notes are heavily Markdown-based.
   - **Limitations**: Requires additional configuration and scripting for direct Neo4j integration.

### 5. **TiddlyWiki + TiddlyMap (Flexible Data Model with Possible API Integration)**
   - **Overview**: TiddlyWiki is a highly customizable, open-source wiki, and with TiddlyMap, it adds graph-based visualization. Though it doesn’t natively support Neo4j, it’s flexible enough to use with external integrations.
   - **Neo4j Integration**: TiddlyWiki doesn’t directly integrate with Neo4j, but its JSON and JavaScript structure make it easier to export data to Neo4j via API or a custom script.
   - **Self-Hosting**: TiddlyWiki can be self-hosted on any web server or deployed as a single HTML file with a local or server-based backend.
   - **Pros**: TiddlyWiki’s flexibility allows for complex note structures and relationships, which can be converted to Neo4j nodes and edges.
   - **Limitations**: Exporting relationships to Neo4j would require custom scripting.

### Custom-Built Solution Using **Obsidian or Roam API** and **Python Script**
If none of the above fits your needs directly, another option is to set up a custom solution using tools that support APIs, such as **Obsidian** (with DataView plugin) or **Roam Research** (with the Roam API). You could write a Python script to extract notes and relationships periodically and upload them to Neo4j. 

### Key Points for Setting Up the Integration
1. **Scripted Syncing**: Use Neo4j’s Python driver to create a script that parses notes and metadata from your chosen tool and inserts them as nodes and relationships.
2. **Data Transformation**: Ensure your note structure aligns with Neo4j’s graph model (e.g., tags as nodes, links as relationships).
3. **Visualization & Retrieval**: Once your notes are in Neo4j, use **Neo4j Bloom** for an interactive visualization of relationships or build a custom dashboard with **GraphQL** for enhanced visualization and retrieval.

A native integration with Neo4j is uncommon in KM tools, but these flexible, self-hostable tools can all support a custom Neo4j backend for storing and visualizing graph-based relationships.
