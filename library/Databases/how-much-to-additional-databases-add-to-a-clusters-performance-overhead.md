Creating additional databases in a PostgreSQL cluster generally incurs more overhead compared to adding schemas, tables, or data within an existing database. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how each approach affects performance:

### 1. **Multiple Databases:**
   - **Resource Allocation**: Each database operates independently, which means PostgreSQL allocates resources like memory, background processes, and disk space for each database. As the number of databases increases, these resources are consumed cumulatively, potentially leading to increased memory usage and higher disk I/O.
   - **Connection Overhead**: When you connect to a PostgreSQL cluster, you connect to a specific database. The server needs to manage separate connections and transaction logs for each database, which can add overhead, especially with a high number of connections.
   - **Maintenance and Backup**: Maintenance tasks such as vacuuming, indexing, and backups must be managed separately for each database. This can increase the complexity and resource consumption of maintenance operations.

### 2. **Multiple Schemas/Tables in a Single Database:**
   - **Shared Resources**: When you add more schemas or tables within a single database, the resources are shared among all objects. PostgreSQL is designed to handle large databases with numerous tables and rows efficiently.
   - **Connection Efficiency**: All tables and schemas in a single database are accessible through a single connection, which reduces the connection overhead compared to managing multiple databases.
   - **Maintenance and Performance**: Maintenance tasks like vacuuming and indexing are often more efficient within a single database context. PostgreSQL optimizes these operations across tables within the same database, which can result in better overall performance.

### Summary:
- **Performance**: Generally, adding more schemas, tables, and data to an existing database is more efficient and scales better than creating multiple databases. The overhead associated with multiple databases (resource allocation, connection management, and maintenance) can degrade performance more significantly than simply adding more data within a single database.
- **Use Case Consideration**: Multiple databases might be necessary for logical separation (e.g., multi-tenant systems where each tenant has their own database). However, if performance is a priority and logical separation can be maintained with schemas or table names, keeping data within a single database is usually preferable.
