There is no universally accepted **voluntary database** that allows individuals to indicate that they do not wish to receive **promotional newsletters** from all senders. However, there are a few steps and options you can take to reduce unsolicited promotional emails:

### 1. **Do Not Contact Lists / Services**
There are some country-specific or third-party services that attempt to maintain **"do not contact"** or **"do not email"** lists, though they are not universally enforced:

- **DMAchoice (United States)**:
  - **Direct Marketing Association** offers **DMAchoice**, which lets you opt out of marketing lists used by direct marketers, including both email and postal mail.
  - **How It Works**: You register with DMAchoice, which communicates your preference to many companies that adhere to DMA standards.
  - **Limitations**: This primarily applies to marketers who are members of the DMA; it won't stop all marketers or unsolicited sales outreach.
  - **Website**: [DMAchoice.org](https://dmachoice.thedma.org/)

### 2. **Spam Reporting Services**
- **Spamhaus**:
  - **Spamhaus** maintains a list of domains and IP addresses that have been identified as sources of unsolicited emails. Reporting spammy domains and ensuring your email preferences are communicated might help improve overall outcomes.
  - **How It Works**: Though it won’t block email at the individual level, reporting spam may result in those marketers being blocked by email servers subscribing to the Spamhaus services.

### 3. **Anti-Spam Regulations**
- **GDPR / CAN-SPAM Compliance**:
  - In regions like the **European Union**, **GDPR** mandates that companies must not email individuals without consent. Similarly, the **CAN-SPAM Act** in the United States regulates unsolicited emails.
  - **How to Enforce**: Make sure that every company you're receiving unsolicited emails from is aware of your preference for not receiving promotional content. If they do not comply, you may have the right to report them to authorities (for GDPR) or the FTC (for CAN-SPAM).
  - **Limitations**: Enforcement is done on a case-by-case basis, and the effectiveness depends on your willingness to file complaints.

### 4. **Third-Party Services to Reduce Email Subscriptions**
- **Leave Me Alone**: 
  - Leave Me Alone offers a service that proactively allows you to **view all your subscriptions** and unsubscribe from newsletters.
  - It doesn't prevent new subscriptions but helps keep your inbox free of promotions.
  - **Website**: [Leave Me Alone](https://leavemealone.app/)

- **Clean Email**:
  - This tool can scan your inbox, identify subscriptions, and allow you to unsubscribe or automatically archive promotional messages. It effectively reduces the impact of receiving these newsletters.
  - **Website**: [Clean Email](https://clean.email/)

### 5. **Use a Disposable Email Service for Signups**
Consider using a **disposable or alias email address** when signing up for services that are likely to send promotional content. This doesn't remove you from existing promotional lists, but it can help reduce future clutter:

- **10 Minute Mail**, **Guerrilla Mail**, or **Mailinator** for temporary email addresses.
- Use **Gmail Aliases** to filter newsletters: add **+promo** or **+newsletter** to your address when signing up (e.g., `yourname+promo@gmail.com`). You can then filter these emails automatically.

### 6. **Email Preference Services**
- **Unroll.Me**:
  - A service that helps you view all your subscriptions and unsubscribe from those you no longer want.
  - **Note**: Unroll.Me has had some privacy concerns in the past. Ensure you are comfortable with their terms before using.
  - **Website**: [Unroll.Me](https://unroll.me/)

### Conclusion
Unfortunately, there is no global "do not email" registry that universally prevents all promotional newsletters. Your best options are to leverage **tools like DMAchoice**, **unsubscribe services**, and **temporary emails** to manage and reduce promotional emails.

If you want to take a more **regulatory** approach, you could pursue companies that don’t follow opt-out rules, especially under **GDPR** (in Europe) or **CAN-SPAM** (in the US). Tools like **Leave Me Alone** or **Clean Email** are particularly useful if you’re looking for an automated solution to regularly clean up your inbox from unwanted subscriptions.
