When deciding between storing data locally or in an external database using a tool like JetAdmin, scalability is a key consideration. Hereâ€™s a comparison:

### **Storing Data Locally:**

\- **Scalability**: Limited. Local storage is typically constrained by the physical resources available on your local machine or server (e.g., disk space, processing power). As the amount of data grows, you might quickly reach these limits, requiring additional hardware or upgrades.

\- **Performance**: For small datasets, local storage can offer faster access because data retrieval does not rely on network latency. However, as the dataset grows, performance may degrade.

\- **Maintenance**: Requires manual management of backups, redundancy, and scaling of hardware resources, which can be time-consuming and technically challenging.

### **Storing Data in an External Database:**

\- **Scalability**: Highly scalable. External databases, especially cloud-based solutions (like AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL, or Azure SQL Database), can handle large volumes of data. They offer automatic scaling options, allowing you to adjust resources as your data needs grow.

\- **Performance**: External databases are optimized for handling large datasets, with powerful querying capabilities and the ability to distribute data across multiple servers (in the case of cloud solutions). However, performance might be affected by network latency, though this is usually minimal with modern infrastructure.

\- **Maintenance**: Most external databases offer managed services, where maintenance tasks such as backups, updates, and scaling are handled automatically, reducing the burden on your team.

### **Conclusion:**

\- **External Database**: More scalable in the long term, especially if you anticipate significant growth in your data volume or if you need high availability and reliability. It also reduces the maintenance burden.

\- **Local Storage**: May be sufficient for small projects or during the early stages, but scalability is limited, and it could become a bottleneck as your project grows.

For most scenarios, especially where scalability is a concern, storing data in an external database is the better choice.
