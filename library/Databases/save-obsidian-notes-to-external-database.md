# Prompt

Are there any Obsidian plugins that are able to store the outputs in an external relational database? Or any ways to achieve this?

# Output
While Obsidian itself does not natively support storing outputs in an external relational database, there are some methods and plugins you can use to achieve this goal:

### 1. **Obsidian to SQL Plugin**
   - **Description**: There is an experimental plugin called **Obsidian to SQL** that allows you to store your notes in an SQLite database. This can be extended or adapted to push data to an external relational database like MySQL or PostgreSQL.
   - **How to Use**:
     - Install the Obsidian to SQL plugin from the Obsidian community plugins or GitHub.
     - Configure the plugin to store your notes in SQLite, and then use a script or middleware to transfer this data to your external relational database.

### 2. **Custom Script with Obsidian API**
   - **Description**: Obsidian has a plugin API that can be used to write custom scripts. You can create a plugin that hooks into the Obsidian API to listen for changes to your notes and then push those changes to an external relational database.
   - **How to Use**:
     - Write a plugin using JavaScript/TypeScript that utilizes the Obsidian API to capture note content and metadata.
     - Use Node.js with a database library (like `pg` for PostgreSQL or `mysql` for MySQL) to insert or update the data in your external database.

### 3. **Export Notes to a Relational Database via Script**
   - **Description**: You can periodically export your markdown notes to an external relational database using a custom script. This method involves writing a script that reads the markdown files and inserts the content into your database.
   - **How to Use**:
     - Write a Python or Node.js script that parses the markdown files in your Obsidian vault.
     - Extract relevant data (e.g., title, content, metadata) and insert it into your relational database.
     - Automate this process using a cron job or a similar scheduling tool.

### 4. **Use a Syncing Tool**
   - **Description**: Use a syncing tool like `rclone` or custom scripts to sync your Obsidian vault with a folder on a server where a process monitors and updates the database with the content of new or updated markdown files.
   - **How to Use**:
     - Sync your Obsidian vault with a remote directory on your server.
     - Have a process or script on the server that watches the directory for changes, reads the markdown files, and updates the relational database accordingly.

### 5. **Zapier or Integromat (Make) Integration**
   - **Description**: If you prefer a no-code approach, you could use a service like Zapier or Integromat to automate the process of pushing Obsidian content to a relational database.
   - **How to Use**:
     - Set up an automation workflow that monitors changes in a specific folder (where you store your markdown files).
     - When a change is detected, the content is parsed and sent to your relational database using a connector for MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.

### **Considerations:**
   - **Performance**: Directly syncing every note change to an external database could have performance implications, so it might be better to batch updates or sync periodically.
   - **Data Integrity**: Ensure your script or plugin handles errors gracefully, especially when interacting with external databases.
   - **Security**: If you're syncing to a remote server, make sure the connection is secure, and consider encrypting sensitive data.

By using one of these methods, you can store your Obsidian outputs in an external relational database, allowing you to leverage the power of SQL for queries, reporting, and integration with other systems.## Extracted Prompts
