**Summary:** You are asking if there is any wiki software that integrates closely with graph database storage and principles.

### Wiki Software That Integrates with Graph Databases

While traditional wikis are typically built around relational databases, some emerging platforms are more aligned with **graph database** principles. Here are a few options that integrate or work closely with graph databases:

### 1. **Foam + Neo4j**
   - **Description**: Foam is a popular open-source knowledge management tool that integrates seamlessly with **Visual Studio Code** and can be used with **Markdown** files. While it is not natively a graph database-based tool, it has been adapted by some users to integrate with **Neo4j**.
   - **How It Works**: Foam allows for graph-style connections (links) between notes, which can be exported and visualized using tools like Neo4j. There are community plugins and scripts to sync Foam notes with Neo4j, enabling more advanced querying and graph exploration.
   - **Best For**: Users who want a flexible, code-centric wiki tool that can be extended to work with graph databases.
   - **Website**: [Foam](https://foambubble.github.io/)

### 2. **Roam Research / Logseq**
   - **Description**: Roam Research is a popular note-taking and knowledge management app that uses a **graph-based data model** to connect ideas. Logseq is an open-source alternative with a similar graph-centric approach.
   - **How It Works**: Roam Research and Logseq create bi-directional links between notes, which are stored and visualized as a **knowledge graph**. While they don’t natively store data in a traditional graph database (like Neo4j), they operate on graph principles and can export data that can be adapted for use in graph databases.
   - **Best For**: Users looking for a visual, interconnected knowledge graph approach without needing to manage a separate graph database backend.

     - [Logseq](https://logseq.com/)

### 3. **Obsidian + Neo4j Integration**
   - **Description**: **Obsidian** is a Markdown-based note-taking and personal knowledge management tool with a **graph view** to visualize connections between notes. Some users have developed integrations to **export** or **sync** notes to **Neo4j**, allowing for deeper graph-based exploration.
   - **How It Works**: By exporting Obsidian’s internal link structure to Neo4j, users can leverage graph database capabilities like querying, pathfinding, and visualization, providing more power than Obsidian’s built-in graph view.
   - **Best For**: Users who want to use a flexible Markdown-based wiki but want to extend it to graph databases for advanced analysis.
   - **Website**: [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)

### 4. **TiddlyWiki + TiddlyMap**
   - **Description**: **TiddlyWiki** is a highly customizable, single-page wiki that can be extended with various plugins, including **TiddlyMap**, which visualizes notes as a graph. It doesn't natively store data in a graph database but can mimic graph behavior.
   - **How It Works**: TiddlyMap integrates directly with TiddlyWiki to create a **mind map** or graph view of your notes, allowing you to see connections and dependencies. The data can also be exported and processed for use in external graph databases.
   - **Best For**: Users looking for a lightweight, customizable wiki with graph visualization features.
   - **Website**: [TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com/), [TiddlyMap](https://tiddlymap.org/)

### 5. **NeoWiki (Custom Solution)**
   - **Description**: **NeoWiki** isn’t a specific software you can download, but some developers have created **custom wiki solutions** using Neo4j as the backend. These are typically bespoke setups where the wiki structure (pages, links) is stored directly in a graph database like Neo4j.
   - **How It Works**: Custom applications built on frameworks like **Node.js** or **Python** can use Neo4j as the backend to store and query wiki data. This approach requires more technical work but allows for native graph database storage and querying capabilities.
   - **Best For**: Advanced users or developers willing to build a custom wiki on top of a graph database.
   - **Website**: Explore projects on platforms like **GitHub** for inspiration.

### 6. **Memgraph**
   - **Description**: **Memgraph** is a graph database platform that has been used to create knowledge graphs and store interconnected data. While not a wiki itself, developers can build wiki-like applications on top of it using **GQLAlchemy** or **Python**.
   - **How It Works**: Memgraph’s **real-time graph capabilities** can be leveraged to create dynamic, interconnected knowledge repositories. By building a frontend that mimics a wiki, users can create pages and links directly managed by Memgraph.
   - **Best For**: Developers and advanced users who want a real-time, dynamic graph-based knowledge management system.
   - **Website**: [Memgraph](https://memgraph.com/)

### 7. **DokuWiki + Neo4j Plugin (Community)**
   - **Description**: **DokuWiki** is a simple, file-based wiki that has been extended by community plugins. While it doesn’t natively connect to graph databases, there are plugins and custom scripts to enable integration with **Neo4j**.
   - **How It Works**: You can use a plugin or custom script to export DokuWiki data (pages, links) into a format that can be imported into Neo4j. This way, you can analyze the wiki’s structure and connections using graph database tools.
   - **Best For**: Users who prefer traditional wiki software but want to extend their analysis using graph databases.
   - **Website**: [DokuWiki](https://www.dokuwiki.org/)

### Summary:
- **Graph-Oriented Tools**: **Roam Research**, **Logseq**, and **TiddlyMap** offer native graph views, mimicking graph database behavior.
- **Markdown Integration**: **Foam** and **Obsidian** can be extended to work with graph databases like **Neo4j** for advanced visualization.
- **Custom Solutions**: Developers can build bespoke graph-based wikis using **Neo4j** or **Memgraph** for full control over graph data storage and querying.

These tools and approaches offer a range of possibilities, from traditional wiki software enhanced with graph principles to fully customized graph database-based solutions. Depending on your technical skill and project needs, you can choose the most suitable option.
