# Prompt

what's the difference between database name and creation name in mongoDB? should they be the same?

# Output
Based on the information provided in the image and the MongoDB documentation, there isn't a specific concept of "creation name" that's distinct from the database name in MongoDB. Here's what we can understand:

1. Database Name:
   - This is the actual name of the database in MongoDB.
   - It's used to identify and access the database.
   - Database names must follow certain naming conventions (e.g., cannot be an empty string, have specific character limitations).

2. Creating a Database:
   - In MongoDB, you don't explicitly create a database with a separate "creation name".
   - A database is created implicitly when you first store data in it.
   - The name you use when first inserting data or switching to a new database (using `use <dbname>`) becomes the database name.

3. Collection Name:
   - When creating a database through a UI (like MongoDB Atlas), you're often asked to provide both a database name and an initial collection name.
   - This is because MongoDB databases contain collections, and you need at least one collection to store data.

4. Consistency:
   - The database name you use when creating it should be the same name you use to access it later.
   - There's no separate "creation name" that differs from the actual database name.

In summary, in MongoDB, the database name is the only name associated with a database. There isn't a separate concept of a "creation name" that differs from the database name. When you create or first use a database, the name you give it becomes its permanent name for access and identification purposes.
