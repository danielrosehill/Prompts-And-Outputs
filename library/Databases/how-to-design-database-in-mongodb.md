*Note: this repository consists of the outputs of large language models (LLMs). In many cases, these are unedited or minimally edited. The information provided is for demonstrative purposes only and is intended to highlight constraints and capabilities in LLM applications and prompt engineering strategies.*


# Prompt

You're familiar with the basic idea for Output Hub. As you know, there are three core "modules" for recording custom LLM agents, prompts, and outputs. For the moment lets limit the additional metadata to one "follow up activities" lookup which should be used for capturing follow up activities flowing from specific outputs. Could you provide a basic model for how this should be designed in MongoDB?
# Output

Certainly! Based on your requirements for the Output Hub system with three core modules (agents, prompts, and outputs) and an additional "follow up activities" lookup for outputs, here's a basic model design for MongoDB:

1. Agents Collection:
```javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId(),
  name: String,
  description: String,
  configuration: Object,
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

2. Prompts Collection:
```javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId(),
  title: String,
  content: String,
  agentId: ObjectId,  // Reference to the agent used
  status: String,     // e.g., "Drafting" or "Run"
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

3. Outputs Collection:
```javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId(),
  content: String,
  promptId: ObjectId,  // Reference to the prompt used
  agentId: ObjectId,   // Reference to the agent used
  metadata: {
    programmingLanguages: [String],
    // Other metadata fields as needed
  },
  createdAt: Date
}
```

4. FollowUpActivities Collection:
```javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId(),
  outputId: ObjectId,  // Reference to the related output
  description: String,
  status: String,      // e.g., "To Do", "In Progress", "Completed"
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

This design allows for:

1. Storing agent configurations separately, which can be referenced by both prompts and outputs.
2. Tracking the status of prompts (Drafting or Run).
3. Linking outputs to their corresponding prompts and agents.
4. Adding metadata to outputs, such as programming languages used.
5. Creating follow-up activities that are linked to specific outputs.

To query related data, you can use MongoDB's aggregation framework. For example, to get an output with its related prompt, agent, and follow-up activities:

```javascript
db.outputs.aggregate([
  {
    $match: { _id: outputId }
  },
  {
    $lookup: {
      from: "prompts",
      localField: "promptId",
      foreignField: "_id",
      as: "prompt"
    }
  },
  {
    $lookup: {
      from: "agents",
      localField: "agentId",
      foreignField: "_id",
      as: "agent"
    }
  },
  {
    $lookup: {
      from: "followUpActivities",
      localField: "_id",
      foreignField: "outputId",
      as: "followUpActivities"
    }
  },
  {
    $unwind: "$prompt"
  },
  {
    $unwind: "$agent"
  }
])
```

This model provides a flexible structure that can be easily extended as your requirements grow. You can add indexes on frequently queried fields (like `promptId` and `agentId` in the outputs collection) to improve query performance as your data scales.
