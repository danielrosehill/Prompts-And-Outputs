The three database-related files you see in your **Homebox** data directory are part of a **SQLite** database, which uses multiple files to manage its data and ensure consistency. Hereâ€™s an explanation of each:

1. **`homebox.db`**:
   - This is the **main database file** that contains the actual data stored by the application. It holds all the tables, indexes, and records that your application uses.

2. **`homebox.db-shm`**:
   - This is the **shared memory file**. It's used as part of SQLite's **Write-Ahead Logging (WAL)** mode, which helps manage multiple transactions more efficiently. It allows concurrent reads while writes are being processed.
   - This file is temporary and is typically removed when the database connection is closed properly.

3. **`homebox.db-wal`**:
   - This is the **Write-Ahead Log (WAL)** file. In WAL mode, changes to the database are first written to this file before being committed to the main `homebox.db` file.
   - This provides better performance and ensures database consistency during transactions.

### Summary:
- **`homebox.db`**: Main database file containing the actual data.
- **`homebox.db-shm`**: Shared memory file used for concurrent access (temporary).
- **`homebox.db-wal`**: Write-Ahead Log that stores changes before they are applied to the main database.

These files together help SQLite manage transactions efficiently and ensure data integrity.
