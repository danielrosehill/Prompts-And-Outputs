# Prompt

We just looked at data notebooks that could be used as data publishing platforms by allowing users to create visualisations and assets like blogs which could be used to narrate them. 

I explained that my data publishing project would likely involve creating visualisations (including tables and geovisualisations) that synthesised data sources. An example is multiplying values from a financial feed of stock prices with multipliers stored locally.

Another requirement of my project is that I'd need a local database to store some data (and combine it with an API). Can you think of any data notebooks (or environments) where I could both provision a local database (which is persistent), work on visualisations, and push them out to a frontend? I'm trying to simplify the stack as far as possible!

I should clarify as well that I don't want to run any infrastructure locally. I'm looking for solutions that would allow me to do everything in the cloud.

Finally, I'd like the ability to be able to work on my visualisations before they are published and shown to the world. So something that mirrors a drafting process would be highly useful.
