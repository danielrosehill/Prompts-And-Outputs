Here are some graph databases that can be self-hosted for free:

1\. **Neo4j Community Edition**

\- **Description**: Neo4j is one of the most widely used graph databases. The Community Edition is free and open-source, offering core graph database features without the advanced enterprise features.

\- **Self-Hosting**: Can be easily self-hosted on any server or local machine.

2\. **ArangoDB Community Edition**

\- **Description**: ArangoDB is a multi-model database that includes graph, document, and key-value store capabilities. The Community Edition is free and open-source.

\- **Self-Hosting**: Can be self-hosted and supports various deployment options including Docker.

3\. **Dgraph**

\- **Description**: Dgraph is a distributed, open-source graph database that is designed for high performance and scalability. It supports complex graph queries with low latency.

\- **Self-Hosting**: Dgraph can be self-hosted on your own infrastructure and is designed for easy deployment.

4\. **JanusGraph**

\- **Description**: JanusGraph is an open-source, distributed graph database optimized for large-scale graph analytics. It integrates with big data technologies like Apache Cassandra, HBase, and Elasticsearch.

\- **Self-Hosting**: JanusGraph can be self-hosted and requires integration with a backend storage system like Cassandra or HBase.

5\. **OrientDB Community Edition**

\- **Description**: OrientDB is a multi-model database that combines the features of a graph database with document, key-value, and object-oriented models. The Community Edition is free and open-source.

\- **Self-Hosting**: Can be self-hosted on a server or local environment, with various deployment options including Docker.

6\. **Blazegraph**

\- **Description**: Blazegraph is an open-source graph database that supports RDF/SPARQL, making it ideal for semantic graph applications. It is known for its performance and scalability.

\- **Self-Hosting**: Blazegraph can be self-hosted and is often used in academic and research environments.

7\. **Titan**

\- **Description**: Titan is an open-source distributed graph database designed to handle very large graphs. It has been succeeded by JanusGraph but remains available for self-hosting.

\- **Self-Hosting**: Titan can be self-hosted but is less commonly used now that JanusGraph is available.

8\. **Apache TinkerGraph**

\- **Description**: TinkerGraph is the reference implementation of the TinkerPop framework, a graph computing framework. It is in-memory, lightweight, and perfect for small to medium-sized graph processing.

\- **Self-Hosting**: TinkerGraph can be self-hosted and is often used in conjunction with other TinkerPop-enabled databases.

9\. **Cayley**

\- **Description**: Cayley is an open-source graph database inspired by Google's Knowledge Graph. It supports multiple backend storage systems, including LevelDB and Bolt.

\- **Self-Hosting**: Cayley can be self-hosted on your own infrastructure, and itâ€™s designed for simplicity and easy deployment.

10\. **Weaver**

\- **Description**: Weaver is a graph database designed for large-scale distributed environments. It focuses on high performance and scalability.

\- **Self-Hosting**: Weaver can be self-hosted, though it requires a more complex setup to manage its distributed architecture.

These databases offer various features and capabilities, making them suitable for a range of graph-based applications, from small projects to large-scale deployments. They all support self-hosting, allowing you to control your environment and data.
