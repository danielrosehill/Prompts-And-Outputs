# Prompt
You are asking how to delete all the rows in a CSV from row 911 to the end of the data. Here's a step-by-step guide to achieve this using **Python** and **Pandas** or using a simple **command-line** approach with `sed`.

### Option 1: Using Python and Pandas

You can use Python with the Pandas library to load the CSV, slice the data to keep only the rows you need, and then save it back.

1. **Install Pandas** (if you donâ€™t have it):
   ```bash
   pip install pandas
   ```

2. **Python Script** to delete rows from 911 to the end:

   ```python
   import pandas as pd

   # Load the CSV file into a DataFrame
   df = pd.read_csv('yourfile.csv')

   # Keep only rows before row 911 (i.e., keep rows 0 to 910, since indexing starts from 0)
   df_trimmed = df.iloc[:910]

   # Save the trimmed DataFrame back to a CSV file
   df_trimmed.to_csv('yourfile_trimmed.csv', index=False)

   print("Rows from 911 onward have been deleted.")
   ```

### Option 2: Using `sed` Command Line (Linux/Mac)

If you're working on a Unix-like system (Linux/Mac), you can use the `sed` command to remove lines starting from line 911.

1. Open the terminal and run:
   ```bash
   sed '911,$d' yourfile.csv > yourfile_trimmed.csv
   ```

   - `911,$d`: This tells `sed` to delete lines starting from line 911 (`$` refers to the end of the file).
   - `yourfile.csv`: The original CSV file.
   - `yourfile_trimmed.csv`: The output file with the rows removed.

### Option 3: Using Excel or a Spreadsheet Program

If you prefer using a graphical tool like Excel or LibreOffice Calc:
1. Open the CSV in Excel or LibreOffice.
2. Highlight rows 911 to the end.
3. Right-click and select **Delete**.
4. Save the file.

### Summary
- **Pandas** offers a Python-based approach to filter the CSV by row number.
- **sed** is a command-line utility that can easily delete lines from large text files.
- Spreadsheet tools like **Excel** or **LibreOffice Calc** provide a manual way to remove rows visually.
