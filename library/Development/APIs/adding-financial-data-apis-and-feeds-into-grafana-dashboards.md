### **Guide to Using Stock Market and Financial APIs in Grafana**

Grafana is a powerful visualization platform that can connect to various APIs to display real-time stock market data, financial metrics, and other data types in customizable dashboards. Here's how to set up stock market data visualizations using APIs.

### **1. Choose the Financial Data API**
To begin, you'll need a financial data API that provides access to stock prices, financial indices, exchange rates, etc. Popular APIs include:
   - **Alpha Vantage**: Offers stock prices, cryptocurrencies, and financial indicators.
   - **Yahoo Finance API**: Provides stock quotes and financial data for global markets.
   - **IEX Cloud**: Gives access to real-time and historical stock market data.
   - **TASE (Tel Aviv Stock Exchange)**: For Israeli market-specific data, although many TASE data feeds are paid, there may be some free options.

### **2. Set Up API Access**
Once you've chosen a suitable API:
   - **Register** for an API key. Most APIs, even free ones, require an API key for access.
   - **Check API Limits**: Free APIs often have usage limits, so make sure to account for this in your setup if you're planning to pull data frequently.

### **3. Use an HTTP Data Source Plugin in Grafana**
Grafana allows for integration with any API using its **JSON** or **SimpleJSON** plugin to retrieve data from external sources. Here’s how to configure it:

1. **Install SimpleJSON Plugin**:
   - From Grafana’s UI, go to **Configuration > Plugins**.
   - Search for **SimpleJSON** and install it.
   - Restart Grafana if needed.

2. **Create a New Data Source**:
   - Go to **Configuration > Data Sources** and click **Add Data Source**.
   - Choose **SimpleJSON**.
   - Enter the **API URL** of the financial service you're using (e.g., the API endpoint for stock data).

3. **Use a Custom Backend to Fetch and Format Data**:
   - Grafana will send HTTP requests to the API, so you may need a middleware service to format the API response into the format Grafana expects.
   - Write a small server (e.g., using Python’s Flask or Node.js) to handle the API requests and format them to JSON responses for Grafana.

### **4. Set Up Panels in Grafana**
Once you’ve set up the data source:
   - **Create a new dashboard**.
   - **Add a panel** and choose the data source you’ve created (SimpleJSON).
   - Define the **API query** within the panel’s configuration to pull real-time or historical stock data.
   - You can set the data refresh rate to pull updates periodically (e.g., every minute or hour).

### **5. Customize Your Financial Data Visualizations**
Grafana provides various visualization options, such as:
   - **Time-series graphs**: Show stock prices over time.
   - **Single Stat widgets**: Display current stock prices or key financial indicators.
   - **Heatmaps or Gauges**: Represent market trends or volatility.

You can combine multiple widgets into one dashboard for an overall financial monitoring tool.

### **Free Data Feeds for Israeli Financial Markets**
Finding free data feeds for the **Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE)** or Israeli markets can be challenging, as many data feeds are either restricted or charge for real-time access. However, here are some options:

1. **Yahoo Finance (Israeli Stocks)**
   - While Yahoo Finance doesn’t have a dedicated API, you can scrape its data or use third-party APIs to access stock prices for companies listed on TASE.
   - Example endpoint: `https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/<TASE_SYMBOL>/`

2. **Alpha Vantage**
   - While Alpha Vantage doesn’t specifically focus on the Israeli market, you can use it for companies traded internationally that are based in Israel, such as Teva Pharmaceuticals.
   - **Free Tier**: 5 API calls per minute and 500 per day.
   - API Documentation: [Alpha Vantage API](https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/)

3. **IEX Cloud (Limited Data)**
   - Offers free access to some international stock market data, which may include Israeli companies traded on U.S. exchanges.
   - **Free Tier**: Limited API calls per month.
   - API Documentation: [IEX Cloud API](https://iexcloud.io/docs/api/)

4. **TASE Website**
   - The **Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE)** offers real-time data through its official website, though most APIs require a subscription. You may find delayed or limited free access to daily market summaries.
   - **Website**: [Tel Aviv Stock Exchange](https://info.tase.co.il/Eng/)

5. **Quandl**
   - Quandl offers historical financial data, including stock prices for many international markets. Free tiers provide access to certain data, though TASE data may require a paid plan.
   - **Website**: [Quandl](https://www.quandl.com/)

### **Example: Fetching Data from Alpha Vantage**
Here’s an example of how you might pull data from Alpha Vantage and visualize it in Grafana:

1. **Fetch Data**:
   - Register for an API key at Alpha Vantage.
   - Use the following API call to fetch stock data (replace `API_KEY` and `SYMBOL` with your actual key and the stock symbol of interest):
     ```bash
     https://www.alphavantage.co/query?function=TIME_SERIES_DAILY&symbol=SYMBOL&apikey=API_KEY
     ```

2. **Create an API Script**:
   - Write a script (e.g., Python) to pull this data and format it for Grafana.

3. **Display in Grafana**:
   - Configure Grafana to call the script via the SimpleJSON plugin, and use it to visualize the stock data in a time-series graph.

### Conclusion:
To create stock market visualizations in Grafana, you can connect to APIs like **Alpha Vantage**, **Yahoo Finance**, or even **Quandl**. For Israeli financial data, **TASE** data might require a paid service, but Yahoo Finance or Alpha Vantage may provide limited access to Israeli companies. Using Grafana’s **SimpleJSON** plugin and data sources from these APIs, you can build customizable financial dashboards.
