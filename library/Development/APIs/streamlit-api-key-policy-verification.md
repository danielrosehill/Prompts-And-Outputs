# Prompt

So it's possible to deploy an app to Streamlit that requires the user to provide an API key?

# Output

Yes, it is possible to deploy a Streamlit app that requires users to provide their own API key. This approach is often used when you want to allow users to access external services through your app without incurring costs yourself or sharing your own API credentials. Here are some key points about implementing this:

1. User Input for API Key:
   You can use Streamlit's input widgets to allow users to enter their API key. For example:

   ```python
   api_key = st.text_input("Enter your API key", type="password")
   ```

2. Secure Handling:
   It's crucial to handle the API key securely. Never store or log the user's API key. Use it only for the current session.

3. Session State:
   You can store the API key in Streamlit's session state to persist it during the user's session:

   ```python
   if api_key:
       st.session_state['api_key'] = api_key
   ```

4. Using the API Key:
   Use the provided API key to make requests to the external service:

   ```python
   if 'api_key' in st.session_state:
       # Use st.session_state['api_key'] to make API calls
   ```

5. Clear Instructions:
   Provide clear instructions to users on how to obtain an API key for the service you're integrating with.

6. Error Handling:
   Implement error handling for cases where the API key is invalid or expired.

7. Security Considerations:
   Warn users about the security implications of entering their API key in a web application.

8. Alternative: Secrets Management:
   For more sensitive applications, you might consider using Streamlit's Secrets Management feature to allow users to securely store their API keys server-side, rather than entering them each time.

Remember, while this approach allows users to use their own API keys, it also means they need to have an account with the API provider and manage their own usage and billing. Make sure to communicate this clearly in your app's documentation or UI.
