# Prompt

A question. I've binded a scripts folder on my desktop as a submodule to a main "scripts" repo. If I add new scripts directly into the submodule ... can I push those up just as if it were its own module in git? and if so would i do the push from within the submodule or the base repo ... or does it matter?

# Output

Yes, you can push changes from within the submodule just like you would for any Git repository. Here's how it works:

### Understanding Submodules:
Submodules in Git are independent repositories that are linked to a "superproject" (the main repository). When you make changes in the submodule, you are working within that independent Git repository, even though it is embedded within the larger project.

### Workflow for Pushing Changes to Submodule:
1. **Navigate to the Submodule**: You will need to go into the submodule directory.
   ```bash
   cd ~/path-to-your-main-repo/submodule-folder
   ```

2. **Stage and Commit Changes in the Submodule**:
   Add and commit your new scripts (or any changes) in the submodule as you normally would:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Added new script"
   ```

3. **Push the Changes in the Submodule**:
   You need to push the changes from within the submodule itself:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```
   Replace `main` with the branch name if you're working on a different branch.

### Updating the Superproject:
Once you've pushed the changes to the submodule, you'll notice that the superproject will see that the submodule's commit has changed (i.e., it points to a new commit). You'll want to record this update in the superproject:

1. **Navigate back to the main project (superproject)**:
   ```bash
   cd ~/path-to-your-main-repo
   ```

2. **Stage and Commit the Submodule Update**:
   The main repository needs to track the new commit of the submodule, so commit this update in the superproject:
   ```bash
   git add submodule-folder
   git commit -m "Updated submodule to new commit"
   ```

3. **Push Changes in the Main Repository**:
   Finally, push the changes in the main repository so that the updated submodule reference is reflected in the main project:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

### Summary:
- **You should push from within the submodule** for the changes made in the submodule.
- **Then, commit the submodule reference update in the main repo** to ensure the main repository tracks the latest commit of the submodule.
