# Prompt

I mean though if I want to use this repo from another computer. I'll need all the files in the repo. But I still don't want them to be accessible to others

If you want to sync **all files** (including the private ones) across multiple machines, but **keep them hidden from others** who may access the repository, you'll need to take a slightly different approach. Since Git by itself doesn't support "private files" in a public repo, you have two main options to achieve this:

### Option 1: Use **Encrypted Files**
You can store sensitive files or folders in the repository in an **encrypted format**, ensuring that only those who have the decryption key (like you on your other machines) can access and decrypt them.

- **How it works**: Files are stored in the repository but **encrypted**, making them unreadable to others without the correct key.

#### Tools for Encryption in Git:

1. **git-crypt**:
   - `git-crypt` allows you to automatically **encrypt certain files** in the repository using symmetric encryption.
   - You and trusted collaborators can decrypt and work with the files, but to others, the files appear as encrypted blobs.
   
   **Setup Process**:
   - Install `git-crypt` on all computers where you need access to the repository:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install git-crypt  # On Ubuntu/Debian
     ```
   - Initialize `git-crypt` in your repository:
     ```bash
     git-crypt init
     ```
   - Define the files or folders to be encrypted in `.gitattributes`. For example, to encrypt `.obsidian`:
     ```bash
     .obsidian/* filter=git-crypt
     ```
   - Add **GPG keys** for collaborators (or just for yourself) so that only certain people can decrypt the files.

2. **BlackBox** (by StackExchange):
   - `BlackBox` works similarly to `git-crypt`, allowing you to encrypt files before committing them to the repository.
   - This tool is useful for teams but also works well for individuals who need to keep private files synced across machines.

   **Setup Process**:
   - Install `BlackBox` and configure it in your repository.
   - Encrypt specific files (e.g., `.obsidian/*`).
   - Use `blackbox_edit` to decrypt the files when you need to work with them, and they will remain encrypted for others.

### Option 2: Use a **Private Fork** or **Separate Private Repo for Sensitive Files**
Another approach is to create a **separate private repository** for the sensitive files (or fork the main repo into a private one), syncing between the two as necessary. This keeps the sensitive files **out of the public repo** altogether while allowing you to use them across machines.

#### Steps:
1. **Public Repository**: The main repository remains public, but it doesn't contain your sensitive files or folders (e.g., `.obsidian`).
2. **Private Repository**: You create a private repository (or private fork) that contains your sensitive files and is only accessible by you (or selected collaborators).
   - You can use a tool like [**Git Submodules**](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) to include the private repo within the public repo without exposing its contents.

   **Example**:
   - Public repo (GitHub): Contains all non-sensitive project files.
   - Private repo (GitHub or another service): Contains `.obsidian` and other sensitive files.
   - On your machine, use submodules to bring both repositories together:
     ```bash
     git submodule add git@github.com:your-private-repo.git private-folder
     ```
     This way, you can work with both repos seamlessly, but others who clone the public repo wonâ€™t have access to the private one.

### Option 3: Manual Sync (Less Ideal)
You could keep the private files **out of the public repo** and **sync them manually** between your devices using other tools, such as **rsync**, **cloud storage**, or private file-sharing services. While this doesn't integrate the files into Git directly, it ensures your private files are still synced.

#### Example:
- Use a service like **Dropbox**, **Google Drive**, or a private **NAS** to sync the `.obsidian` folder between devices while excluding it from the Git repo.
- Sync only non-sensitive parts of the project in the public repo.

### Conclusion
If you need all files in the repo across multiple machines while keeping them hidden from others:

1. **Encryption (e.g., git-crypt)** is the most seamless solution. It allows you to store all files in the repo, but only you (and authorized users) can decrypt them.
2. **Using a private repo for sensitive files** (or submodules) is another way to keep certain files completely separate from the public repo while syncing them privately.
