# Prompt

Could I use a Bash alias to fire off the script?

# Output

Yes, you can create a Bash alias to run your script, which would make it even easier to use. A Bash alias allows you to define a shortcut for longer commands, including scripts, so you can run it with a simple keyword.

### Steps to Create a Bash Alias for Your Script:

1. **Open Your Bash Configuration File**:

   You need to add the alias to your `.bashrc` (or `.bash_profile` depending on your system). To open `.bashrc` for editing, use:
   ```bash
   nano ~/.bashrc
   ```

2. **Add the Alias**:

   Scroll to the bottom of the file and add a line to define your alias. Here’s an example:

   ```bash
   alias gitupdate="~/scripts/global_git_push.sh"
   ```

   This creates an alias called `gitupdate` that will run your `global_git_push.sh` script.

3. **Save and Exit**:
   
   - In `nano`, press `CTRL + O` to save the file, then `CTRL + X` to exit.

4. **Reload the Bash Configuration**:

   After editing `.bashrc`, you need to reload it so that the alias is available in your current terminal session:
   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

5. **Use the Alias**:

   Now, you can run the script using the alias you defined. For example:
   ```bash
   gitupdate
   ```

   If you want to pass a custom commit message:
   ```bash
   gitupdate "My custom commit message"
   ```

### Advantages of Using an Alias:
- **Quick Access**: You can run your script from any directory by typing the alias.
- **Simple and Clean**: The alias keeps your command short, even if the script's path is long.

# Input

If I do this, I don't need to add the script to my path anymore right?

# Output

That's correct! 

If you create a Bash alias, **you do not need to add the script to your `PATH`**. The alias directly points to the script’s location, so there’s no need to include it in your `PATH`.

By using the alias, you’re essentially creating a shortcut that can be used in any terminal session to run the script, without needing to make the script globally accessible via `PATH`.

In summary:
- **With the alias approach**, there's no need to modify `PATH`.
- You can keep your script anywhere (e.g., `~/scripts/`) and just reference it via the alias in your `.bashrc`.
