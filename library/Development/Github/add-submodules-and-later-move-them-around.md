# Prompt

Great. I'd like to add all of these as submodules to a main repository
However, I might want to move around where they "slot in" at a later point in time
Is there any way that I can set this up in a way that gives me that flexibility?

# Output

Yes, you can set up your submodules in a way that allows for flexibility in their placement within the main repository. Here's an approach that can give you this flexibility:

1. Create a dedicated subdirectory for submodules:
First, create a subdirectory in your main repository specifically for submodules. For example, you could call it "submodules" or "components".

```bash
mkdir submodules
```

2. Add submodules to this directory:
Add all your submodules to this dedicated directory. This keeps them organized in one place initially.

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/danielrosehill/My-LLM-Prompt-Library-Public-Version- submodules/prompt-library
git submodule add https://github.com/danielrosehill/My-LLM-Context-Repo-Public submodules/context-repo
# ... and so on for all other repositories
```

3. Use symbolic links for flexible placement:
Instead of directly using the submodules in your project structure, create symbolic links to the submodules. This allows you to "place" the submodules wherever you want in your project structure without moving the actual submodule.

```bash
ln -s submodules/prompt-library desired/path/to/prompt-library
ln -s submodules/context-repo another/path/to/context-repo
```

4. Update .gitignore:
Make sure to add the symbolic links to your .gitignore file so that Git doesn't track them:

```
# Add to .gitignore
desired/path/to/prompt-library
another/path/to/context-repo
```

Benefits of this approach:

1. Flexibility: You can easily change where the submodules appear in your project structure by updating the symbolic links, without having to move the actual submodules.

2. Organization: All submodules are kept in one place, making it easier to manage them.

3. Easy updates: You can update all submodules from one location.

4. Minimal impact on Git: Since the symbolic links are ignored by Git, changing the project structure doesn't affect your Git history.

When you want to move a submodule's "location" in your project:

1. Remove the old symbolic link
2. Create a new symbolic link to the desired location
3. Update your .gitignore file

This approach gives you the flexibility to reorganize your project structure without having to move the actual submodules or change your Git setup.
