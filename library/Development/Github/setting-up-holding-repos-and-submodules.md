# Prompt

I'd like to begin using submodules to organise my growing list of Github projects. Can you help me to think of - firstly - a way to name these "holding" repos that can allow me to easily distinguish them when reviewing my repos

# Output

When organizing your growing list of GitHub projects using **submodules**, a clear and consistent naming convention for your "holding" repositories can greatly help in distinguishing them and managing your workflow. Below are some suggestions on how to name and structure these repositories to make them easy to identify and manage.

### Naming Strategies for “Holding” Repositories

1. **Purpose-Based Naming**:
   - **What it is**: Organize your repositories based on their overarching purpose or function. This method makes it clear what kind of projects each "holding" repository contains.
   
   **Examples**:
   - `Personal-Projects`
   - `Work-Projects`
   - `Side-Projects`
   - `DevOps-Tools`
   - `Web-Development-Configs`
   - `Client-Projects`
   
   **Pros**:
   - Clear and intuitive.
   - Easy to understand at a glance.
   - Good for organizing projects by goal or domain.

   **Cons**:
   - May become ambiguous as projects grow or expand into multiple purposes.

2. **Context-Based Naming (Personal/Work/Client)**:
   - **What it is**: Categorize the repositories based on context, such as whether they are personal, professional, or related to a client. You can even subcategorize based on the type of project within these contexts.

   **Examples**:
   - `Work-Config-Files`
   - `Personal-Dev-Scripts`
   - `Client-X-Project-Scripts`
   - `Freelance-Side-Projects`
   - `Personal-Experiments`
   
   **Pros**:
   - Gives clarity based on the setting (personal vs work, freelance vs clients).
   - Can help separate different contexts in life (e.g., career, hobby, freelance).

   **Cons**:
   - If you manage many client projects, the list might still grow complex.

3. **Technology/Stack-Based Naming**:
   - **What it is**: Group repositories by the primary technology, language, or framework used. This is useful for distinguishing different technical domains and can help when you work across multiple stacks.
   
   **Examples**:
   - `Python-Projects-Holding`
   - `NodeJS-Utilities`
   - `DevOps-Configs`
   - `Linux-Configs`
   - `Python-Automations`
   - `Frontend-JavaScript-Library`

   **Pros**:
   - Makes it easy to navigate based on the technology stack.
   - Good for developers with a diverse toolset or working in polyglot environments.

   **Cons**:
   - Some projects might span multiple technologies, making it hard to categorize.

4. **Organize by Functionality**:
   - **What it is**: Create holding repos based on the **role** or **function** of the submodules. For instance, you might have one for **configuration files**, another for **backup utilities**, and another for **infrastructure management**.

   **Examples**:
   - `Backup-Scripts-Collection`
   - `Config-Files-Holding`
   - `Automation-Scripts-Holding`
   - `Infrastructure-Management-Utilities`
   - `Frontend-UI-Libraries`
   
   **Pros**:
   - Well-organized by the type of work each repository does.
   - Especially useful for differentiating projects with clear functionality.

   **Cons**:
   - Some projects may fit into multiple functional categories (overlap).

5. **Organize by Project Lifecycle or Stage**:
   - **What it is**: Create holding repositories that correspond to different phases or stages of development. This can help you track active development, deprecated projects, or projects still in planning.

   **Examples**:
   - `Experimental-Projects`
   - `Active-Development`
   - `Legacy-Projects`
   - `Archived-Repos`
   - `Maintenance-Mode`
   
   **Pros**:
   - Good for keeping track of the state of each project.
   - Helps you focus on active work, while maintaining legacy or archived projects in separate holdings.

   **Cons**:
   - Over time, it might become subjective which projects belong in which phase.

6. **Hybrid Naming**:
   - **What it is**: Combine the above approaches to create a naming scheme that provides even more detail. You can combine purpose, context, and stack to create names that are more specific and helpful.

   **Examples**:
   - `Work-Frontend-JavaScript-Configs`
   - `Client-Python-Utilities`
   - `Personal-Experimental-Automations`
   - `Freelance-Backend-Python-Libraries`
   
   **Pros**:
   - Extremely specific and easy to identify.
   - Great for users with many repositories.
   
   **Cons**:
   - Can get long-winded.
   - Requires consistency and attention to detail in naming.

### Example Structure

Here’s an example of how you might structure the **"holding" repositories** using a hybrid naming convention for maximum clarity:

1. **Holding Repository Names**:
   - `Work-Backend-Python-Configs`
   - `Work-Frontend-DevOps-Scripts`
   - `Client-Scripts-Freelance`
   - `Personal-Linux-Configs`
   - `Personal-Frontend-Experiments`

2. **Submodules Inside the Holding Repos**:
   - In the `Work-Backend-Python-Configs` holding repository, you might have submodules for:
     - `API-Configs`
     - `Microservices-Settings`
     - `CI-CD-Pipeline-Scripts`
     
   - In the `Personal-Linux-Configs` holding repository, you might have:
     - `Bash-Aliases`
     - `Zsh-Config`
     - `Neovim-Setup`

---

### Summary of Suggestions:

- **Purpose-Based**: Organize by the general purpose of the repositories.
- **Context-Based**: Organize by the context (personal, work, clients, etc.).
- **Technology-Based**: Group by technology stack or primary language used.
- **Functionality-Based**: Group by the type of function (e.g., configuration files, utilities).
- **Lifecycle-Based**: Categorize based on development stage or lifecycle (active, experimental, archived).
- **Hybrid**: Combine aspects of the above methods to create detailed, descriptive names.

### Next Steps

1. **Define Categories**: Based on how you work and the complexity of your projects, decide which organization method fits your workflow best.
   
2. **Plan Ahead**: If your projects are rapidly growing, anticipate potential future needs, and organize your "holding" repos in a scalable way.

3. **Apply the Naming Convention**: Go ahead and create the **"holding" repositories** on GitHub, and then use **submodules** to organize your projects under each category.
