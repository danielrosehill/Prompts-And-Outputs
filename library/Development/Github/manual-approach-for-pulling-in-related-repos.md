# Prompt

I have a different idea. I'll create a script at the base of the main repository called related modules (or something like that). It will pull in the related modules and save them to a subdirectory. But the script should not clone the git configuration, just the files. Is it possible to do something like this?

# Output

Your idea of creating a script to pull related modules without cloning the entire Git repository is certainly possible and can be a good approach for your use case. This method allows you to fetch only the files you need without the Git history or configuration. Here's how you can implement this:

## Creating a Script for Related Modules

You can create a bash script (let's call it `fetch_related_modules.sh`) at the root of your main repository. This script will download the latest version of specified files or directories from related repositories without cloning the entire Git repository.

Here's an example of how this script might look:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Directory to store related modules
MODULES_DIR="related_modules"

# Function to download a file or directory from a GitHub repository
fetch_github_content() {
    local repo=$1
    local path=$2
    local branch=${3:-main}
    local output_dir=$4

    # Create the output directory if it doesn't exist
    mkdir -p "$output_dir"

    # Fetch the content
    curl -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json" \
         "https://api.github.com/repos/$repo/contents/$path?ref=$branch" | \
    jq -r '.[] | select(.type != "dir") | .download_url' | \
    xargs -n 1 curl -L -o "$output_dir/$(basename {})"

    echo "Downloaded content from $repo/$path to $output_dir"
}

# Ensure the modules directory exists
mkdir -p $MODULES_DIR

# Fetch Obsidian-Prompt-Output-Saver
fetch_github_content "danielrosehill/Obsidian-Prompt-Output-Saver" "Versions/V2" "main" "$MODULES_DIR/Obsidian-Prompt-Output-Saver"

# Add more repositories as needed
# fetch_github_content "username/repo" "path/in/repo" "branch" "$MODULES_DIR/output_folder"

echo "All related modules have been fetched."
```

This script does the following:

1. It defines a function `fetch_github_content` that uses the GitHub API to fetch contents of a specific path in a repository.
2. It creates a directory called `related_modules` to store the fetched files.
3. It then calls the function for each repository you want to include, specifying the repo, path, branch, and output directory.

## Using the Script

1. Save this script as `fetch_related_modules.sh` in the root of your main repository.
2. Make it executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x fetch_related_modules.sh
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   ./fetch_related_modules.sh
   ```

## Advantages of This Approach

- **Flexibility**: You can easily add or remove modules by editing the script.
- **Lightweight**: It only downloads the files you need, not the entire Git history.
- **Customizable**: You can specify exactly which files or directories to fetch from each repository.
- **Version Control**: The script itself can be version-controlled in your main repository.

## Considerations

- This method doesn't maintain Git version control for the fetched files. If you need to track versions, you might need to implement a custom versioning system or consider using Git submodules instead.
- You'll need to run the script manually (or set up automation) to update the files when changes occur in the source repositories.
- Ensure you have the necessary permissions to access the repositories you're fetching from.

This approach gives you the flexibility to manage related modules without the overhead of full Git repositories, which seems to align well with your desired workflow.

# Question

Hmm. The thing is that I would like this script to be visible in the repo so that anyone can use it and pull in the updated related project configs. Is that possible?

# Answer

Absolutely! You can definitely make the script visible and accessible in your repository for anyone to use. Here's how you can achieve this:

1. Create the script file:
   Create a file named `fetch_related_modules.sh` in the root directory of your main repository (Obisidian-For-LLM-Capture).

2. Add the script content:
   Copy the bash script content we discussed earlier into this file.

3. Commit the script:
   Add, commit, and push the script to your repository:

   ```
   git add fetch_related_modules.sh
   git commit -m "Add script to fetch related modules"
   git push
   ```

4. Update README:
   In your repository's README.md file, add a section explaining the purpose of the script and how to use it. For example:

   ```markdown
   ## Related Modules

   This repository uses a script to fetch related modules from other repositories. To update the related modules:

   1. Ensure you have `curl` and `jq` installed on your system.
   2. Run the following command from the root of this repository:

      ```
      ./fetch_related_modules.sh
      ```

   This will download the latest versions of related modules into the `related_modules` directory.
   ```

5. Make the script executable:
   Ensure the script has executable permissions:

   ```
   git update-index --chmod=+x fetch_related_modules.sh
   git add fetch_related_modules.sh
   git commit -m "Make fetch_related_modules.sh executable"
   git push
   ```

By following these steps, the script will be visible in your repository, and anyone who clones or forks your project can easily use it to fetch the latest versions of related modules. This approach allows for easy updates and maintenance of related project configurations while keeping them separate from the main repository's version control.

Remember to update the script as needed when you add or remove related modules, and consider adding comments in the script to explain what each section does for better maintainability.
