*Note: this repository consists of the outputs of large language models (LLMs). In many cases, these are unedited or minimally edited. The information provided is for demonstrative purposes only and is intended to highlight constraints and capabilities in LLM applications and prompt engineering strategies.*


# Prompt

I am building a library of prompts to use for evaluating LLMs so that I can identify which will be the most helpful for the specific use-cases I'm targeting. To begin, I'm developing a repository of evaluation prompts: prompts specifically written to compare the capabilities of different LLMs. Please produce a context snippet to simply note this information

# Output

**Context Snippet for LLM Evaluation Prompt Library:**

Daniel is building a repository of evaluation prompts designed to compare the capabilities of different large language models (LLMs). The goal of this library is to assess which LLMs are most effective for specific use cases relevant to his projects. The prompts focus on a variety of tasks, including summarization, code generation, sentiment analysis, and more. By developing this prompt collection, Daniel aims to create a standardized approach to evaluating LLMs and determining their utility in targeted workflows.
