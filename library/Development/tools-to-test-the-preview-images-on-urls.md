To test the social sharability of a URL and check how the preview (image, title, description) appears, you can use the following tools:

### 1. **Facebook Sharing Debugger**
   - **URL:** [Facebook Sharing Debugger](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/)
   - **Purpose:** Shows how a URL will be displayed when shared on Facebook. It highlights any issues with Open Graph tags and allows you to refresh the cached preview.
   - **Usage:** Paste your URL, and it will show the preview along with any Open Graph metadata errors.

### 2. **Twitter Card Validator**
   - **URL:** [Twitter Card Validator](https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator)
   - **Purpose:** Displays how your URL will appear when shared on Twitter. It also checks for issues with Twitter Card tags.
   - **Usage:** Enter your URL, and it will render the card preview.

### 3. **LinkedIn Post Inspector**
   - **URL:** [LinkedIn Post Inspector](https://www.linkedin.com/post-inspector/)
   - **Purpose:** Allows you to see how your link will look when shared on LinkedIn. It will fetch the title, description, and image used for the preview.
   - **Usage:** Paste the URL, and LinkedIn will display the preview and show any issues with metadata.

### 4. **Slack Link Preview Tool**

   - **Purpose:** Ensures that the link preview shows correctly when shared on Slack.
   - **Usage:** Simply paste the URL into a Slack chat to see how the preview looks. Adjust metadata if it doesn't display as expected.

### 5. **SEO Meta Tags Analyzer**
   - **URL:** [SEO Site Checkup](https://seositecheckup.com/tools/meta-tags-analyzer) or [Meta Tags.io](https://metatags.io/)
   - **Purpose:** Although not exclusively for social previews, these tools check if all meta tags, including Open Graph and Twitter Cards, are correctly set up. 
   - **Usage:** Enter your URL, and it will analyze the tags, helping identify any issues that may prevent proper previews on social platforms.

### 6. **Meta Tag Generator & Tester**
   - **URL:** [MetaTags.io](https://metatags.io/)
   - **Purpose:** Lets you generate Open Graph and Twitter card tags and see a real-time preview of how they would appear on different platforms.
