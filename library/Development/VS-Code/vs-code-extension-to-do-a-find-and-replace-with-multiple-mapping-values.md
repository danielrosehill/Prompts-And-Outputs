Yes, you can accomplish a bulk find-and-replace across files in **VS Code** without writing a Python script. While VS Code's built-in find-and-replace feature is powerful, it doesn't natively support bulk find-and-replace using a dictionary or mapping. However, there are a few ways you can achieve this:

### 1. **Manual Multi-Step Find-and-Replace Using VS Code**

VS Code has a built-in **global find-and-replace** feature:

- Press `Ctrl + Shift + H` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + Shift + H` (macOS) to open the global find-and-replace panel.
- You can manually perform each find-and-replace by pasting the original name and replacing it with the updated name.

However, this would require multiple steps if you have many entries, as you need to manually enter each replacement.

### 2. **Using VS Code Extensions**

#### **A. `Find and Replace by JSON` Extension**
This extension allows you to perform find-and-replace operations using a JSON file that defines the mappings, similar to how you would do it in Python. Here's how it works:

- Install the extension from the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JackyTung.find-and-replace-by-json).
  
- Create a JSON file with the replacement mappings like this:

  ```json
  {
    "Bahamas, The": "Bahamas",
    "Congo, Dem. Rep.": "Democratic Republic of the Congo",
    "Congo, Rep.": "Republic of the Congo"
  }
  ```

- Run the **"Find and Replace by JSON"** command from the command palette (`Ctrl + Shift + P` or `Cmd + Shift + P`).

- It will search for the original names and replace them with the updated ones in all files in your workspace.

#### **B. `Multiple Search and Replace` Extension**
This extension lets you specify multiple find-and-replace pairs and execute them all at once.

- Install the [Multiple Search and Replace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=zsage.multiple-search-and-replace) extension.
  
- Configure the mappings in the settings or in a specific file and then execute the multiple find-and-replace operation across files.

### 3. **Find and Replace Using Regex**

If your replacements follow a predictable pattern, you could potentially use **regex (regular expressions)** to perform bulk replacements in one expression using VS Codeâ€™s search feature:

- Open **global search** (`Ctrl + Shift + H` or `Cmd + Shift + H`).
- Toggle **Regex mode** (using the `.*` button).
- Construct a regex expression that matches your specific "find" strings and replace them with the corresponding values.

This approach works best if the pattern can be generalized, but it can get complex if there are many unique entries.

### 4. **VS Code Tasks or Macros**

If you're comfortable with a bit more automation, you can define **VS Code tasks** or use an extension like **Macros** to automate multiple steps of find-and-replace operations. This would require some setup but is more powerful if you intend to do bulk replacements frequently.

---

### Summary

The **easiest way** to automate this in VS Code, especially for many replacements, is to use the **Find and Replace by JSON** or **Multiple Search and Replace** extensions. They allow you to specify the mappings in JSON or a settings file and execute them all at once, just like in a script but integrated into the editor.
