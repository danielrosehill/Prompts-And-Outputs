# Prompt

I'm working on a large amount of github repos throughout the day. 
I'm trying to figure out a streamlined system for quickly moving between them
I work in VS Code
I tried an extension called Project Manager which was nice but doesn't allow me to move them to different locations
Can you think of something more flexible? I basically want to be able to jump between different repos with a few key presses

# Output

For quickly moving between multiple GitHub repositories in VS Code, there are a few efficient approaches you can consider:

## Workspaces

VS Code's built-in workspace feature is excellent for managing multiple projects:

1. Create a workspace file (`.code-workspace`) that includes all your frequently used repos[7].
2. Add folders to the workspace using the "Add Folder to Workspace" command or by dragging and dropping folders into the File Explorer[7].
3. Use the "File > Open Recent" menu or Ctrl+R shortcut to quickly switch between workspaces.

## Remote Repositories Extension

The Remote Repositories extension by GitHub allows you to open repositories directly without cloning[5]:

1. Install the Remote Repositories extension.
2. Use the "Open Remote Repository" command to search and open GitHub repos instantly.
3. Switch between repos using the remote indicator in the lower-left corner of VS Code[5].

## Git Features in VS Code

Utilize VS Code's built-in Git features for efficient repo management[1]:

1. Use the Source Control view (Ctrl+Shift+G) to see all your repositories.
2. Quickly switch between repos using the "Git: Checkout to" command in the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P)[1].
3. Use the "Git: Clone" command to easily add new repositories to your workspace[6].

## Custom Keyboard Shortcuts

Create custom keyboard shortcuts for frequently used commands:

1. Open the Keyboard Shortcuts editor (File > Preferences > Keyboard Shortcuts).
2. Assign shortcuts to commands like "Workspaces: Open Workspace" or "Git: Checkout to"[3].

## Tips for Streamlined Workflow

1. Use the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) to quickly access Git and workspace-related commands[1].
2. Leverage the "File > Open Recent" menu to switch between recently opened folders or workspaces.
3. Utilize the "Source Control Repositories" view to manage and switch between multiple Git repositories in your workspace[2].

By combining these approaches, you can create a flexible and efficient system for moving between different repos with just a few keystrokes. The workspace feature, in particular, allows you to organize repos into logical groups while maintaining the flexibility to open them in different locations on your file system.
