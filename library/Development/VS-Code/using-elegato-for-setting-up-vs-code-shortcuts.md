# Prompt

I want to set up an Elegato Stream Mini soon. Can you think of some ways I could use that device to set up some of these shortcuts and hotkeys?

# Output

Certainly! The Elgato Stream Deck Mini is an excellent tool for streamlining your workflow, especially when working with multiple GitHub repositories in VS Code. Here are some ways you can set up shortcuts and hotkeys on your Stream Deck Mini to enhance your productivity:

## VS Code Specific Actions

1. **Repository Switching**: 
   - Set up buttons for your most frequently used repositories.
   - Use the "Open" action to directly open specific project folders[1].

2. **Git Commands**:
   - Create buttons for common Git operations like "Git: Commit", "Git: Push", and "Git: Pull"[1].
   - Use the "Visual Studio Code" plugin to execute these commands directly[4].

3. **Workspace Switching**:
   - Configure buttons to open different VS Code workspaces.
   - Use the "Open" action with your `.code-workspace` files[1].

4. **Custom VS Code Commands**:
   - Set up buttons for frequently used VS Code commands.
   - Find command IDs in VS Code's Keyboard Shortcuts menu and use them with the VS Code plugin[1][4].

## Development Workflow Enhancements

1. **Terminal Commands**:
   - Create buttons for common terminal commands you use in your development process[1].
   - Use the "Super Macro" plugin to execute complex terminal commands[3].

2. **Snippet Insertion**:
   - Set up buttons to insert commonly used code snippets[1].
   - This can be particularly useful for boilerplate code or documentation templates.

3. **Build and Run Actions**:
   - Configure buttons for building, running, and debugging your projects[3].
   - Use multi-actions to combine several steps into one button press.

4. **Task Automation**:
   - Use the "Super Macro" plugin to automate repetitive tasks that involve multiple steps or mouse clicks[3].

## Productivity Boosters

1. **Application Launcher**:
   - Set up buttons to quickly launch your most-used development tools and applications[3].

2. **Window Management**:
   - Create buttons for arranging windows or switching between different layouts.
   - This can be particularly useful when working with multiple monitors.

3. **Profile Switching**:
   - Utilize Stream Deck's profile feature to switch between different sets of buttons for different projects or tasks[3].

4. **Status Indicators**:
   - Use plugins to display system information like CPU load or current time[3].
   - This can help you keep track of resources while working on intensive tasks.

## Setting Up

1. Install both the Stream Deck software and the "Stream Deck for Visual Studio Code" extension in VS Code[1][4].

2. Use the Stream Deck software to configure your buttons, assigning actions and icons as needed[2].

3. For VS Code specific actions, use the "Visual Studio Code" plugin available in the Stream Deck marketplace[2][4].

4. Experiment with multi-actions and plugins like "Super Macro" for more complex automations[3].

By setting up these shortcuts and hotkeys on your Elgato Stream Deck Mini, you can significantly streamline your workflow, making it easier to switch between repositories, execute common commands, and automate repetitive tasks. This setup can save you time and reduce the cognitive load of remembering numerous keyboard shortcuts.
