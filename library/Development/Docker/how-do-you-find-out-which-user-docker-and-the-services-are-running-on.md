**Summary:** You want to find out which user Docker services (including the Outline service) are running under on your server. Your server user is `daniel`.

### Determine Which User Docker and Outline Are Running On

Docker containers generally run processes as a specific user defined by the Docker image or specified in the Docker Compose file. To check the users:

### 1. **Check the User Running Docker Containers**

1. **Find the Docker Daemon User**
   - The Docker daemon (which manages Docker containers) typically runs as `root`. To confirm, run:
     ```bash
     ps aux | grep dockerd
     ```
   - The output should show a line similar to:
     ```bash
     root     1234  0.0  0.1 ... /usr/bin/dockerd
     ```
   - **Note**: If `dockerd` is running as `root`, this means that any containers it manages will run under Dockerâ€™s permissions.

### 2. **Find the User Inside the Docker Containers**

You can check which user a specific Docker container process is running as by following these steps:

1. **Identify the Running Containers**
   - List all running Docker containers:
     ```bash
     docker ps
     ```

2. **Inspect the Outline Container**
   - Use `docker exec` to enter the Outline container:
     ```bash
     docker exec -it <outline-container-id> /bin/bash
     ```
   - Replace `<outline-container-id>` with the actual ID or name of the Outline container from the `docker ps` output.

3. **Check the User Inside the Container**
   - Run the following command inside the container:
     ```bash
     whoami
     ```
   - This command will tell you the user under which the Outline service is running. Common users for Docker containers include `root`, `postgres`, `outline`, or others defined by the container's configuration.

4. **Exit the Container**
   - Type `exit` to leave the container.

### 3. **Check the Docker Compose Configuration for User Settings**

1. **Look for the `user` Directive in `docker-compose.yml`**
   - Open your `docker-compose.yml` and check if any services (like Outline, Redis, or PostgreSQL) specify a specific user under the `user` directive:
     ```yaml
     outline:
       image: docker.getoutline.com/outlinewiki/outline:latest
       user: "1000:1000"
     ```
   - If `user` is specified, the container will run with that user ID and group ID. If not specified, the default user defined by the Docker image will be used (often `root`).

2. **Check User IDs in Containers**
   - You can also check the user IDs by inspecting the running processes:
     ```bash
     docker exec <outline-container-id> id
     ```
   - This will give you information about the user ID (`uid`) and group ID (`gid`) being used inside the container.

### 4. **View Processes Running on the Host for Docker Containers**

1. **Identify the Process Running the Outline Container**
   - Run the following command to see the processes run by Docker containers, along with the user running them:
     ```bash
     ps aux | grep <outline-container-id>
     ```
   - Replace `<outline-container-id>` with the actual container ID or name. This will show the processes running inside the container along with the host user.

2. **Inspect Process Information Directly**
   - To get detailed process information, you can also run:
     ```bash
     docker inspect <outline-container-id>
     ```
   - Look for sections related to `User`, `UID`, or any user specifications under `"Config"`.

### Summary of Steps
1. **Check Docker Daemon User**: Use `ps aux | grep dockerd` to confirm the Docker daemon runs as `root` or another user.
2. **Inspect Container User**: Use `docker exec` to enter containers and run `whoami` to find out which user runs the processes inside the container.
3. **Check `docker-compose.yml`**: Look for any user settings specified in the Compose file.
4. **Inspect Process Information**: Use `docker inspect` and `ps aux` to gather more details about how the processes are being executed.

Following these methods should help you identify which users are managing Docker and running the Outline service.
