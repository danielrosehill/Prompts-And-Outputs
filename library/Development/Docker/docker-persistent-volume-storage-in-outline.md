**Summary:** You have shared a part of a Docker Compose configuration for a PostgreSQL service, and you want to know what it means, specifically focusing on the volume for persistent storage and where it is mounted locally.

### Explanation of the Docker Compose Configuration

Here’s a breakdown of the relevant part of the Docker Compose file:

```yaml
postgres:
  image: postgres
  env_file: ./docker.env
  ports:
    - "5432:5432"
  volumes:
    - database-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
```

### What Each Line Means

1. **`postgres:`**
   - This defines a service named `postgres` within the Docker Compose file. When Docker Compose runs, it will start a container based on the settings provided under this service.

2. **`image: postgres`**
   - This tells Docker Compose to use the official **PostgreSQL image** from Docker Hub. The container will be built from this image.

3. **`env_file: ./docker.env`**
   - This specifies an environment file (`docker.env`) located in the same directory as the Docker Compose file. This file will contain environment variables (such as `POSTGRES_USER`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, and `POSTGRES_DB`) that configure the PostgreSQL container.

4. **`ports:`**
   - **`"5432:5432"`**: This line maps port `5432` on the Docker container to port `5432` on the host machine.
     - The first `5432` is the **host port** (your local machine), and the second `5432` is the **container port** (inside the Docker container).
     - This means you can connect to PostgreSQL on your host machine using `localhost:5432`.

5. **`volumes:`**
   - **`database-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data`**:
     - This line defines a **Docker volume** that will be used to store PostgreSQL data.
     - **`/var/lib/postgresql/data`** is the path inside the container where PostgreSQL stores its database files by default. This path is mounted to the volume named `database-data`.
     - **`database-data`** is the name of the Docker volume. Docker volumes are used to persist data so that even if the container stops or is deleted, the data will not be lost.

### What is the Persistent Volume?

- **Volume Name**: `database-data`
  - This is a named volume managed by Docker. You can think of it as a persistent storage space Docker creates on your host machine. When the PostgreSQL container writes data to `/var/lib/postgresql/data`, it is actually writing to `database-data`.
- **Where is it Mounted Locally?**
  - Docker manages volumes separately, so they don’t have a fixed path in the directory structure like normal bind mounts. To find out where `database-data` is stored locally, you can use the following command:
    ```bash
    docker volume inspect database-data
    ```
  - This will show information about the volume, including the path on your host system where the data is stored (e.g., `/var/lib/docker/volumes/database-data/_data`).

### Persistent Storage Summary

- The **`volumes`** section ensures that all the data stored by PostgreSQL inside `/var/lib/postgresql/data` in the container is kept safe even if the container is restarted or deleted.
- **`database-data`** is a named volume, and Docker will manage where it is stored on your host system. You can inspect it using Docker commands to see the exact location.
- This setup is crucial for ensuring that your PostgreSQL database data persists across container restarts and upgrades. 

This explanation should clarify what each part of the Docker Compose configuration does and how the volume ensures persistent data storage for PostgreSQL.
