The error message you're seeing indicates that the command you used is being interpreted incorrectly. It seems you might be trying to run a Docker Compose command using the `docker` command directly, which doesn't support the `-d` (detached) option.

### Correct Command

To run your Docker Compose configuration in detached mode, you should use the `docker-compose` command instead of the `docker` command. Hereâ€™s the correct command:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Explanation
- **docker-compose**: This is the command that invokes the Docker Compose tool, which is specifically designed to manage multi-container Docker applications.
- **up**: This command creates and starts the containers as defined in your `docker-compose.yml` file.
- **-d**: This flag tells Docker Compose to run the containers in detached mode, meaning they will run in the background.

### Additional Tips
1. **Ensure Docker Compose is Installed**: Make sure that Docker Compose is installed on your system. You can check by running:
   ```bash
   docker-compose --version
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Correct Directory**: Make sure you are in the directory where your `docker-compose.yml` file is located when you run the command.

3. **Verify Your Docker Installation**: If you're still having issues, ensure that Docker is running properly by checking with:
   ```bash
   docker info
   ```

By using the correct command, you should be able to start your containers successfully.
