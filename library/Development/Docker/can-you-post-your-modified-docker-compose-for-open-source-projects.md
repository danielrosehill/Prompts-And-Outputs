**Summary:** You are asking if it's legal to share a modified version of the Docker Compose file to help other users.

### Legal Considerations for Sharing Modified Docker Compose Files

In general, **sharing a modified Docker Compose file** is legal, but it depends on a few factors:

### 1. **License of the Software and Docker Compose File**

- **Open Source Licensing**: If the software (e.g., Outline, Redis, PostgreSQL) is open-source and its Docker Compose configuration is distributed under a permissive license (like MIT, Apache 2.0, or GPL), you are typically allowed to modify and share the Docker Compose file. Open-source licenses usually grant permission to modify and redistribute configuration files.
- **Proprietary Software**: If the software components in the Docker Compose file are proprietary, you should check the software’s license agreements. Sharing configuration files for proprietary software might be restricted, especially if the file contains sensitive or proprietary information.

### 2. **What You Are Sharing**

- **Your Own Modifications**: If you are sharing a Docker Compose file that you have modified (e.g., adding or removing services, changing environment variables), and it does not contain proprietary secrets (like passwords, API tokens, or proprietary code), it is generally okay to share.
- **Sensitive Information**: Make sure not to share any sensitive information, such as:
  - **API keys or passwords**: Always strip out sensitive environment variables before sharing.
  - **Proprietary or confidential configuration**: If a service requires licensing or subscription keys, don’t include them in the shared configuration.

### 3. **Documentation and Fair Use**

- **Fair Use and Educational Sharing**: Sharing a modified Docker Compose file to **help others** or for educational purposes usually falls under fair use, especially if you are not profiting from it and if the purpose is to help others set up software in a legal and authorized way.
- **Attribution**: If the Docker Compose file is based on an open-source project, it is good practice to **provide attribution** to the original project. This helps comply with open-source license requirements, especially if the original configuration was released under a license that requires attribution.

### Recommendations for Sharing:

1. **Remove Sensitive Information**: Ensure the file does not contain any proprietary information, such as:
   - Passwords
   - Secret tokens
   - License keys

2. **Provide Proper Attribution**: If the file is based on an open-source project, credit the source project. For example:
   ```yaml
   # This Docker Compose is based on the setup from Outline (https://github.com/outline/outline)
   ```

3. **Check License Terms**: Review the licensing terms of any software you are including in the Docker Compose file to ensure there are no restrictions on sharing configurations.

### Summary:
- **Sharing Open-Source Based Configurations**: Usually permissible as long as you follow the software’s license terms and provide proper attribution.
- **Avoid Sharing Sensitive Information**: Strip out passwords, keys, and proprietary details before sharing.
- **Legal Review**: When in doubt, check the software’s licensing terms or consult with legal expertise.

In most cases, sharing a modified Docker Compose configuration to help others set up similar services is acceptable, especially if it’s for open-source software and does not expose sensitive information.
