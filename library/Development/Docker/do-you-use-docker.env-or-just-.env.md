The naming of the environment variable file can depend on your specific setup and how you are referencing it in your `docker-compose.yml` file. Here are the guidelines:

### Naming Conventions

1. **If Specified in `docker-compose.yml`**:
   - In your `docker-compose.yml` file, you have used `env_file: ./docker.env`. This means that the file should be named **`docker.env`**.
   - Ensure the file exists in the same directory as your `docker-compose.yml`.

2. **If Not Specified**:
   - If you did not specify any `env_file` in your `docker-compose.yml`, Docker Compose will automatically look for a file named **`.env`** in the same directory. This file can contain environment variables that apply to all services in the Compose file.

### Best Practice
- If your services need specific environment variables that are only relevant to that stack, itâ€™s a good practice to name it **`docker.env`** (or something descriptive) to avoid confusion with other projects that may also use a `.env` file.
- If you have a single stack and prefer simplicity, you can name it **`.env`** for consistency with many other tools that automatically look for this filename.

### Conclusion
Since your `docker-compose.yml` specifies `docker.env`, you should create the accompanying environment variable file as **`docker.env`**. If you want to switch to using a `.env` file, you would need to update your `docker-compose.yml` to reflect that change.
