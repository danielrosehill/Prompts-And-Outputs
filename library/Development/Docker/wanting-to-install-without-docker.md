# Prompt

I prefer installing most server software on the operating system as opposed to using docker. I like docker but I think it also adds a lot of complication. Is my belief problematic or uncommon?

# Output

Your belief is not problematic, and it's not uncommon either. Many sysadmins and developers prefer installing server software directly on the operating system rather than using Docker, for several valid reasons:

1. **Simplicity**: Direct installation keeps the environment simpler, especially for those familiar with the OSâ€™s package management and configuration tools. Docker introduces an extra layer of abstraction, which can complicate troubleshooting and monitoring.

2. **Performance**: While Docker is lightweight compared to full virtual machines, it can still introduce some overhead, especially in more resource-constrained environments. Direct installation avoids this overhead.

3. **Fewer Dependencies**: Managing dependencies directly on the OS can give you more control. In contrast, Docker abstracts dependencies in containers, which sometimes requires managing container versions or dealing with Docker-specific quirks.

4. **Learning Curve**: While Docker simplifies some aspects of software deployment, learning to properly use containers, manage volumes, and handle networking adds complexity, especially when debugging containerized applications.

5. **Stable Environments**: In environments where software and server configurations are relatively static, directly installing software is often sufficient and reliable. Docker is often more beneficial in environments with frequent updates or where rapid scaling across different environments is needed.

That said, Docker excels at:

- Isolating environments and dependencies.
- Making deployments more portable.
- Simplifying setup in environments with multiple software versions or services.

In the end, whether to use Docker or not comes down to the specific needs of your use case. Your approach of sticking to traditional installations for simplicity and clarity is shared by many and is perfectly valid, especially for stable or smaller environments.
