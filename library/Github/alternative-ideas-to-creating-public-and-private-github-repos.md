# Prompt

i have become a big fan of using github repositories to manage various technical projects. they're truly a lot of fun. sometimes, i will create both public and private versions for projects. i assume the reason why is self explanatory: the private vesion allows me to be a bit more experimental and the public version is where i can post the more refined outputs. i dislike this method though as creating duplicate repositories for every project is a lot of work. suggest some other approaches I could take.

# Output

It's great that you enjoy using GitHub repositories to manage your technical projects! However, managing both public and private repositories for the same project can be cumbersome. Here are some alternative approaches to help streamline your workflow while maintaining the flexibility to experiment privately and release refined outputs publicly:

### **1. Use Branches for Public and Private Development**

Instead of creating duplicate repositories, you can use **branches** within a single repository. This allows you to maintain a private branch where you can experiment freely and a public branch that showcases more refined outputs.

- **Private Branch (e.g., `dev` or `experimental`)**:  
  This branch is where you can push your work-in-progress, experimental code, and early-stage ideas.
  
- **Public Branch (e.g., `main` or `public`)**:  
  This is the branch that contains the polished and stable versions of your project, which you can make public when you're ready.

#### Benefits:
- **Single repository**: Less duplication and easier to manage.
- **Isolation**: You can keep your experimental work separate from the public, polished work.
- **Flexibility**: Merge changes from your experimental branch into the public branch when you feel they are ready.

#### How to Manage It:
- Keep the **`main`** branch public, and limit access to the **`dev`** branch for your private work.
- When you’re ready to share, **merge** the experimental branch into the main/public branch.
  
### **2. Use GitHub Releases for Public Versions**

Another approach is to maintain a single **private repository** but use **GitHub Releases** to publish public, polished versions of your project.

- **Work Privately**: Keep your experimental work in a private repository.
- **Release Publicly**: Use GitHub Releases to package specific milestones or versions of the project that you want to make public.

#### Benefits:
- **No need for a public repository**: You can keep all development private and only release polished versions.
- **Versioning**: GitHub Releases offer clear versioning, making it easy to show progress and improvements over time.
- **Automation**: You can automate the release process with GitHub Actions to generate public releases from the private repository.

#### How to Manage It:
- Tag a specific commit when you’re ready to create a public release.
- Automate the release process so that once you tag a version, it’s automatically built and published.

### **3. Create a Public Subset of Your Private Repository (with Submodules)**

You can use **GitHub submodules** to manage a subset of your private repository as a public one. For example, keep your experimental work in the private repo, but create a public repo with selected files, scripts, or outputs from the private repository.

- **Private Repository**: This is your main repository with all your experimental work.
- **Public Repository with Submodules**: Use the submodule feature to pull in specific parts or outputs from your private repo that you want to share publicly.

#### Benefits:
- **Granular control**: Choose specific sections or files to make public.
- **No duplication**: You can keep both versions linked without duplicating entire repositories.
- **Focused public repo**: The public repo will contain only what you want to showcase.

#### How to Manage It:
- Use submodules to link specific parts of the private repo.
- Regularly update the public repository’s submodule when you want to release new content.

### **4. Use GitHub Project Boards for Private/Experimental Work**

Another option is to use a **GitHub Project board** in a public repository to manage private or experimental work. This allows you to track experimental ideas, organize them, and selectively add them to the public repository when ready.

- **Public Repository**: Keep your main work in a public repo.
- **GitHub Projects**: Use GitHub Projects within that public repo to manage private experimental tasks, ideas, and features that are still being developed.

#### Benefits:
- **Single repository**: Avoids duplication and keeps everything in one place.
- **Visibility control**: GitHub Projects can include private cards and tasks that are only visible to collaborators.
- **Easy integration**: Move tasks from your experimental board to public issues or features when they’re ready.

#### How to Manage It:
- Create a **Project Board** within the public repository and categorize tasks or experimental ideas.
- Only share public work in the main branch but keep a task log of experimental work in your project boards.

### **5. Use GitHub Forks for Experimental Work**

You can use a **GitHub fork** of your own public repository for private experimentation. Once you’re happy with the results, you can merge the changes back into the main repository.

- **Main Repository (Public)**: This is your main repository that contains the stable, polished version of your project.
- **Fork (Private)**: Create a private fork of the public repository for experimentation. Once your experimental changes are stable, you can submit a pull request from the private fork to the public repo.

#### Benefits:
- **Separation**: Clear distinction between public and private work while using the same codebase.
- **Easy integration**: Forks allow you to experiment privately and merge back to the main repository when the work is ready.
- **No duplication**: Avoid the need to maintain two different repositories for the same project.

#### How to Manage It:
- Fork the public repository into a private repository.
- Work on the experimental features in the private fork and submit pull requests to merge them into the public repo.

### **6. Use GitHub Actions for Automating Public Releases from Private Repos**

GitHub Actions can be used to **automate the process of sharing polished outputs** from your private repository without needing to manually duplicate the work.

- **Private Repository**: Keep all experimental work here.
- **GitHub Actions**: Automate the process of generating and pushing the polished version to a public repository.
  
#### Benefits:
- **No duplication**: Automates the work, so you don't need to manually manage two repos.
- **Automation flexibility**: You can define what gets released and when, allowing you to maintain a clean public repo.

#### How to Manage It:
- Set up GitHub Actions in your private repository to automatically push changes or releases to the public repo when a specific tag or condition is met.

### **7. Create Public "Showcase" Branches Using GitHub Actions**

Similar to GitHub Actions for public releases, you could create **"showcase" branches** in your private repo that automatically push selected polished code to a public branch, maintaining everything in one repository.

- **Private Development**: All experimental work is done in branches that remain private.
- **Public Showcase Branch**: GitHub Actions can automate the push of the refined code to a "showcase" branch that is public-facing.

#### Benefits:
- **No need for a separate public repo**: You can maintain a single repo and only push the polished output to a public branch.
- **Control over what gets shared**: The public "showcase" branch only contains your finished work.

#### How to Manage It:
- Create a "showcase" branch in your private repo and use GitHub Actions to push only polished code to it.
- Set up the public view permissions so that the "showcase" branch is publicly visible while experimental work remains private.

### **In Summary:**
If managing duplicate repositories is cumbersome, you can streamline your workflow by:
- Using **branches** for private/public work.
- Automating releases with **GitHub Actions**.
- Leveraging **submodules** to link parts of your private work to public repos.
- Organizing your experimental work in **Project Boards**.

These approaches allow for experimentation and refinement within a single repository or workflow, minimizing duplication while maintaining a balance between private and public work.
