To create a workflow for saving your **spec requirements for software searches** in Obsidian, you can develop a system that helps you track different iterations of your searches, makes it easy to refer back to previous specs, and allows you to update requirements over time. Here's how you can set this up:

### Folder Structure
1. **Folder Name**: Create a dedicated folder for your software spec requirements in your Obsidian vault. You could name it something like:
   - `Software Search Specs`
   - `Spec Requirements`

2. **Subfolders (Optional)**: If you anticipate needing to categorize specs for different types of software (e.g., note-taking tools, project management apps), you can create subfolders:
   - `Software Search Specs/Note-Taking Tools`
   - `Software Search Specs/Productivity Apps`
   - `Software Search Specs/Dev Tools`

### File Naming Conventions
For each spec document, use a consistent naming convention that includes the software type and version of the spec. This will help you keep track of different iterations:
   - **Format**: `[Type] - [Spec Version] - [Date]`
   - **Example**: `Note-Taking Tools - Spec v1 - 2024-10-10`

This will make it easy to search within Obsidian for a specific version of a spec.

### Workflow for Saving and Updating Specs
1. **Initial Spec Creation**:
   - Create a new note for each software search requirement.
   - Use a structured format to clearly define your criteria for the software you're searching for.

2. **Spec Iteration**:
   - When updating specs or modifying requirements after further searches, create a new version by duplicating the previous note and adding a new version number (`v2`, `v3`, etc.). 
   - Link previous versions at the top of the note, so you can track changes across iterations.

3. **Referencing Iterations**:
   - Keep links to previous versions at the top of each spec note:
     - **Example**:
       ```
       Previous Versions:
       - [[Note-Taking Tools - Spec v1 - 2024-10-10]]
       - [[Note-Taking Tools - Spec v2 - 2024-11-12]]
       ```

### Suggested Format for Each Spec Note
Use a consistent format for each software spec note so you can quickly refer back to key requirements. Here's a template you could use:

---

#### **[Software Type] - Spec Version [X] - [Date]**

##### 1. **Minimum Requirements**
- Feature 1: (e.g., Auto-Format on Paste)
- Feature 2: (e.g., Live Preview)
- Platform compatibility: (e.g., Linux, Android)

##### 2. **Preferred Features**
- Feature 1: (e.g., Self-hostable)
- Feature 2: (e.g., Mobile app sync)
  
##### 3. **Must Support**
- Backup: (e.g., User-controlled backups)
- Security: (e.g., End-to-end encryption)

##### 4. **Excluded Features**
- (List features or attributes you want to avoid)

##### 5. **Search Results**
- Software 1: Notes on how this software fits the specs.
- Software 2: (Details about a second option).

##### 6. **Iteration Notes**
- This version includes changes based on XYZ.

### Workflow for Using Specs
1. **Create a New Spec**: When starting a new software search, create a new note using the template above.
2. **Track Iterations**: As you refine your requirements, create new versions and link back to previous ones.
3. **Cross-Linking**: Cross-link notes whenever you find similar criteria across software types. This way, you can reuse certain specifications without rewriting them each time.
4. **Tags**: Use tags like `#spec`, `#version`, `#software-type` to make searching in Obsidian easier.

### Workflow Example
1. Create a note named `Note-Taking Tools - Spec v1 - 2024-10-10`.
2. In the note, list out the minimum and preferred requirements for note-taking tools.
3. As you find tools, update the note with your findings.
4. When making changes to the spec, create a new version with the name `Note-Taking Tools - Spec v2 - 2024-11-01`, and link it to the previous version.
5. If you perform another software search for a different category, use the same workflow, like `Project Management Tools - Spec v1`.

By following this format, you'll be able to efficiently document and update your software search specs without needing to repeat yourself. Let me know if you'd like to refine any part of this!
