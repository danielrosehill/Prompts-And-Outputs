Yes, you can set up a daily backup of all your GitHub repositories (both public and private) to your Synology NAS. Below is a step-by-step guide to achieve this.

### Prerequisites:

1\. **Synology NAS** with SSH access enabled.

2\. **GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)** with appropriate permissions.

3\. **Git** installed on your Synology NAS.

4\. **A terminal** for command-line access to your Synology NAS.

### Step 1: Generate a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)

1\. Go to \[GitHub Settings\]([https://github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)).

2\. Click on **Generate new token**.

3\. Give the token a descriptive name.

4\. Under **Select scopes**, choose the following:

\- `repo` (Full control of private repositories)

\- `read:user` (Read-only access to your profile)

5\. Click **Generate token** and copy the token. **Save it securely**.

### Step 2: SSH into Your Synology NAS

1\. Open a terminal on your computer.

2\. Connect to your Synology NAS via SSH:

\`\`\`bash

ssh username@your\_nas\_ip

\`\`\`

3\. Enter your password when prompted.

### Step 3: Create a Backup Directory on Your Synology NAS

1\. Create a directory where the repositories will be stored:

\`\`\`bash

mkdir -p /path/to/your/backup/directory

cd /path/to/your/backup/directory

\`\`\`

### Step 4: Write a Shell Script to Clone or Pull Repositories

1\. Create a script file:

\`\`\`bash

nano github\_[backup.sh](http://backup.sh)

\`\`\`

2\. Add the following script:

\`\`\`bash

#!/bin/bash

GITHUB\_USERNAME="your\_github\_username"

TOKEN="your\_github\_token"

BACKUP\_DIR="/path/to/your/backup/directory"

# Get the list of repositories

repos=$(curl -s -u $GITHUB\_USERNAME:$TOKEN [https://api.github.com/user/repos?per\_page=100](https://api.github.com/user/repos?per_page=100) | jq -r '.\[\].ssh\_url')

# Change to the backup directory

cd $BACKUP\_DIR

# Clone or pull each repository

for repo in $repos; do

repo\_name=$(basename "$repo" .git)

if \[ -d "$repo\_name" \]; then

cd $repo\_name

git pull

cd ..

else

git clone $repo

fi

done

\`\`\`

3\. Replace the placeholders:

\- `your_github_username` with your GitHub username.

\- `your_github_token` with the PAT generated earlier.

\- `/path/to/your/backup/directory` with the path to the backup directory you created.

4\. Save the file and exit by pressing `Ctrl + X`, then `Y`, and `Enter`.

5\. Make the script executable:

\`\`\`bash

chmod +x github\_[backup.sh](http://backup.sh)

\`\`\`

### Step 5: Schedule the Script to Run Daily Using Cron

1\. Open the crontab file:

\`\`\`bash

crontab -e

\`\`\`

2\. Add the following line to run the script daily at 2:00 AM:

\`\`\`bash

0 2 \* \* \* /path/to/your/backup/directory/github\_[backup.sh](http://backup.sh) >> /path/to/your/backup/directory/backup.log 2>&1

\`\`\`

3\. Save the file and exit.

### Step 6: Test the Script

1\. Run the script manually to ensure it works:

\`\`\`bash

./github\_[backup.sh](http://backup.sh)

\`\`\`

### Step 7: Verify Backups

1\. Check your backup directory to ensure the repositories were cloned or updated.

2\. Check the `backup.log` file for any errors.

### Optional: Use Docker (if available)

If you'd like a Docker-based solution, you can run a Docker container with a scheduled job to back up your repositories, though the above script is the simplest method directly on the NAS.

This setup will keep your GitHub repositories backed up daily to your Synology NAS. You can adjust the cron job timing or the backup script as needed.
