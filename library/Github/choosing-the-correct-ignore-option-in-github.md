# Prompt

I want to hide the prompts folder. 

Which do I choose?

# Output

To hide the `Prompts` folder from your GitHub repository, you need to add it to the `.gitignore` file. Based on the options shown in your screenshot, you should select `/Prompts`, which will ignore the folder located at the root of your repository.

Steps:
1. Open your `.gitignore` file.
2. Add the following line:
   ```
   /Prompts
   ```
This will ensure that the `Prompts` folder at the root level is ignored and won't be tracked or committed to GitHub.

# Prompt

Can you give me some kind of memory aid to remember that to exclude a folder I need to choose the option with the forward dash before it?

# Output
Here's a simple memory aid to help you remember that a forward slash (`/`) before a folder name is used to exclude the folder at the root level in Git:

**"The root has the /boot!"**

- Imagine the root folder of your project as the "boot" point where everything starts.
- The forward slash `/` represents the root directory.
- By choosing `/Prompts`, you're telling Git to "boot out" (ignore) the `Prompts` folder from the root of your project.

Whenever you see a folder path with a `/` before it in `.gitignore`, it specifically targets the folder in the root directory of your repository.

You can also think of it like this:
- **Slash (/)** = Root level.
- **No Slash** = Ignore any folder with that name anywhere in the project.

Hope this helps you visualize and remember!
