# Prompt

ah I didn't realise i could create the dot env in the directory. i had it at the base of the repo. so i can create multiple .env in the repo?

Yes, you can create multiple .env files in different locations within your repository. Based on the information from the search results, here are some key points about using multiple .env files:

1. Location flexibility: You can create .env files in various locations, including:
   - The root folder of your project
   - The same folder as your Prisma schema
   - The ./prisma folder
   - Any other directory where your script is located

2. Multiple environments: It's common to have multiple .env files for different environments. For example:
   - .env.development
   - .env.sample
   - .env.production (though it's not recommended to store production credentials locally)

3. Loading specific .env files: You can use tools like dotenv-cli to load specific .env files for different environments or purposes. For example:
   ```
   dotenv -e .env.sample -- npx prisma migrate deploy
   ```

4. Precedence: If you have multiple .env files, be aware of the order in which they are loaded. Prisma, for instance, has a specific order it checks for .env files.

5. Conflicts: Be cautious about conflicts between .env files. Some tools may throw errors if they find conflicting variables in different .env files.

6. Security: Remember not to commit sensitive .env files (especially production ones) to your repository. Use .gitignore to exclude them.

7. Organization: You can use comments in .env files to organize and explain variables.

For your specific case, you can create a .env file in the same directory as your backup script. This allows you to have environment-specific configurations without affecting other parts of your repository.

To implement this in your backup script:

1. Create a .env file in the /home/daniel/Git/desktop-config/Fedora-Desktop-Backup-Utility/LAN-Backups/ directory.

2. In your script, update the ENV_FILE path to:
   ```bash
   ENV_FILE="$SCRIPT_DIR/.env"
   ```

This approach allows you to have multiple .env files for different purposes or environments within your repository, keeping configurations separate and organized.
