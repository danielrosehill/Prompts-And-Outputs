# Prompt

If I want to exclude a folder called Admin and all its subdirectories from my github repo what's the right syntax for my gitignore

# Output
To exclude a folder named "Admin" and all its subdirectories from your Git repository, you can use the `.gitignore` file. Here is the correct syntax to add to your `.gitignore` file:

```
Admin/
```

### Explanation

- **Trailing Slash (`/`)**: The trailing slash indicates that "Admin" is a directory. This ensures that Git ignores the directory itself and all of its contents, including any subdirectories and files within it[1][2][3].
- **Placement**: Ensure that this line is added to your `.gitignore` file, which should be located at the root of your Git repository. This will apply the ignore rule to the specified directory throughout the project[4].

By adding `Admin/` to your `.gitignore` file, all files and folders within the "Admin" directory will be ignored by Git, preventing them from being tracked or committed.
