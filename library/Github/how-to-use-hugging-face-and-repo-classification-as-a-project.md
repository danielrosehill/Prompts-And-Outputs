# Prompt

Could you write me a guide about getting starting with the Hugging Face LLMs? Perhaps you could use my little proejct here as an example. The objective can be taking my markdown document of repos and grouping them into ten classifications

# Output

You got it! Here's a guide to getting started with Hugging Face LLMs, using your repository grouping project as an example:

**1.  Set Up Your Environment:**

* **Install Python:**  If you don't already have it, install Python 3.7 or later: [https://www.python.org/](https://www.python.org/)
* **Install Hugging Face Transformers:** This is the primary library for working with Hugging Face models:
    ```bash
    pip install transformers
    ```
* **Install `requests`:**  We'll need this for making HTTP requests:
    ```bash
    pip install requests
    ```
* **Install `pytz` (optional):** For handling timezones:
    ```bash
    pip install pytz
    ```

**2.  Explore the Hugging Face Model Hub:**

* **Visit the Model Hub:** Browse the Hugging Face Model Hub: [https://huggingface.co/models](https://huggingface.co/models)
* **Search for Models:**  Look for models that might be suitable for text classification (like those with "text-classification" in their tags or description).
* **Check the Documentation:**  Each model has its own documentation.  Read the documentation to understand the model's capabilities and how to use it.

**3.  Code Example (using a pre-trained text classification model):**

```python
import requests
import csv
from datetime import datetime
import pytz
from transformers import pipeline

# GitHub API URL
API_URL = "https://api.github.com/user/repos"

# Your Personal Access Token (ensure it has "repo" scope)
PAT = "github_pat_11AJS6R4Y0o2We9L4ohbIt_xxxxxxxQ4YNTrJoxYk7ZLLIGNZMw0rn87I"

def get_repositories():
    # ... (same as before)

def prettify_name(repo_name):
    # ... (same as before)

def write_to_markdown(repositories, output_file):
    print("Writing repositories to Markdown file...")
    now = datetime.now(pytz.utc)
    israel_time = now.astimezone(pytz.timezone('Asia/Jerusalem'))

    with open(output_file, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        f.write(f"# Daniel Rosehill Github Repo Export {israel_time.strftime('%d-%m-%y %H:%M:%S')} (Israel) / {now.strftime('%d-%m-%y %H:%M:%S')} (UTC)\n\n")

        # Load the pre-trained text classification pipeline
        classifier = pipeline("text-classification", model="distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-mrpc") 

        # Group repositories by theme
        grouped_repos = {}
        for repo in repositories:
            prettified_name = prettify_name(repo[0])

            # Classify the repository description (you might want to use the name too)
            classification = classifier(repo[0] + " " + repo[1])[0]['label']

            # Create or append to the group
            if classification in grouped_repos:
                grouped_repos[classification].append(repo)
            else:
                grouped_repos[classification] = [repo]

        # Write grouped repositories to Markdown
        for theme, repos in grouped_repos.items():
            f.write(f"## {theme}\n\n")
            for repo in repos:
                f.write(f"* **{repo[0]}**\n")
                f.write(f"    {repo[1]}\n")
                f.write(f"    {repo[2]}\n\n")

# Main execution
repositories = get_repositories()
output_file = f'github_repositories_{datetime.now().strftime("%Y%m%d_%H%M%S")}.md'
write_to_markdown(repositories, output_file)
print(f"Markdown file '{output_file}' has been created.")
```

**Explanation:**

* **Load Pipeline:**  The code loads a pre-trained text classification pipeline using `pipeline("text-classification", model="distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-mrpc")`. You can choose other models from the Hugging Face Model Hub.
* **Classify Text:**  The `classifier(text)` function takes your repository name and description and returns a classification label (like "technology", "finance", etc.).  
* **Group by Classification:** The code creates a dictionary `grouped_repos` where the keys are the classifications and the values are lists of repositories belonging to that classification. 
* **Write Markdown:** The Markdown output is generated based on the grouped repositories.

**Important Notes:**

* **Model Selection:** Choose a model that is relevant to your repository classification task. The `distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-mrpc` model is a good starting point, but explore other models on the Hugging Face Model Hub.
* **Fine-Tuning:**  For best results, consider fine-tuning a model on a dataset of your own repository names and descriptions to improve its accuracy for your specific use case.
* **Preprocessing:**  You might need to preprocess the text (e.g., remove punctuation, convert to lowercase) before passing it to the classification model.
* **Limited Accuracy:**  Remember that even with fine-tuning, LLMs may not be perfect at automatically grouping repositories. You may still need to do some manual adjustments.

This guide should help you get started with Hugging Face LLMs.  Feel free to ask if you have any further questions. Good luck!
