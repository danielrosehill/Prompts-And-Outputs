Yes, you can set the main branch as your GitHub Pages source. Hereâ€™s how:

1. **Go to Repository Settings**: Open your GitHub repository and navigate to the "Settings" tab.
2. **GitHub Pages Section**: Scroll down to the "Pages" section.
3. **Select Source**: Choose the main branch (often named `main` or `master`) as your GitHub Pages source.
4. **Save Changes**: Click "Save" to apply the settings.

Your documentation will then be available at `https://<username>.github.io/<repo-name>`, and users can still access it via the repo as well.
