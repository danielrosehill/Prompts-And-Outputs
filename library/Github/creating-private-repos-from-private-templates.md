# Prompt

templates seem like a nice solution but I mostly create private repos. Is it possible to make my template private? And to start a new private repo from my private template? If yes, would you mind showing me how?

# Output

Yes, you can absolutely create private template repositories and use them to start new private repositories. This is a great way to maintain consistency across your projects while keeping your work private. Here's how you can do it:

## Creating a Private Template Repository

1. Create a new private repository or use an existing one:
   - Go to GitHub and click on the "+" icon in the top right corner.
   - Select "New repository".
   - Choose a name for your repository.
   - Set the visibility to "Private".
   - Initialize the repository with a README if desired.
   - Click "Create repository".

2. Set up your repository with the desired folder structure and files.

3. Make the repository a template:
   - Go to the main page of your repository.
   - Click on "Settings" near the top right.
   - Scroll down to the "Template repository" section.
   - Check the box next to "Template repository"[2].

Your private repository is now a template repository.

## Creating a New Private Repository from Your Private Template

1. Navigate to the main page of your private template repository.

2. Click on the "Use this template" button near the top right of the page[1].

3. Select "Create a new repository" from the dropdown.

4. Choose the owner for the new repository (this can be your personal account or an organization you belong to).

5. Give your new repository a name.

6. In the "Description" field, you can optionally add a short description.

7. Choose the visibility setting. To make it private, select "Private".

8. If you want to include all branches from the template, not just the default branch, check the box next to "Include all branches".

9. Click "Create repository from template"[1].

GitHub will then create a new private repository based on your private template, complete with all the files and folder structure from your template.

Remember that while the template repository itself remains private, you have control over who can access it and use it as a template. You can manage this in the repository's settings under the "Manage access" section.

By using this method, you can quickly set up new private repositories with your preferred structure and files, saving time and ensuring consistency across your projects.
