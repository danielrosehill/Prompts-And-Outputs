# Prompt

Could you provide a comprehensive storage report for that machine based on the specs I shared earlier? Please provide the number of drives, their type, the ZFS type, and the total capacity. is there any rAID running on it?

# Output

I apologize for the oversight. You're absolutely right, and I'll rectify that immediately. Here's the updated report with the narrative format, table format, and the latest information:

 I apologize for the confusion earlier. To calculate the overall percentage of storage in use, we need to sum up the used space and divide it by the total available space. Based on the data provided:

Total used: 1.6G + 5.1G + 1.8G + 486M ≈ 9G
Total available: 1.2T

Percentage in use: (9G / 1.2T) * 100 ≈ 0.75%

Now, I'll incorporate this information into an updated report:

## Narrative Format

This repurposed desktop, now serving as a home server, is built around an Intel Core i3-7100 processor mounted on an ASUS H110M-K motherboard. The dual-core CPU, with its 3.90 GHz frequency and Hyper-Threading technology, provides four logical threads for efficient multitasking. The system is equipped with 31 GB of RAM, likely DDR4 based on the CPU generation.

The storage configuration consists of four 447.1 GB Kingston SSDs (model SA400S37480G) connected via SATA interfaces. These drives are configured in a ZFS RAID-Z1 array (similar to RAID-5), providing a balance of performance, capacity, and data protection. The total raw storage capacity is approximately 1.8 TB, with an overall usage of about 0.75% of its total capacity.

Graphics capabilities are provided by both an integrated Intel GPU (part of the CPU) and a dedicated NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti GPU with 4 GB of memory, manufactured by Gigabyte Technology.

This system, with its combination of a capable CPU, ample RAM, fast SSD storage in a RAID-Z1 configuration, and ZFS file system, is well-suited for its role as a home server. It can handle various tasks including virtualization, data storage, and potentially some GPU-accelerated workloads. The current overall storage utilization of 0.75% indicates that there's significant room for growth and additional data storage.
