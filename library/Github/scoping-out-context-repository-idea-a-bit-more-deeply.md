*Note: this repository consists of the outputs of large language models (LLMs). In many cases, these are unedited or minimally edited. The information provided is for demonstrative purposes only and is intended to highlight constraints and capabilities in LLM applications and prompt engineering strategies.*


# Prompt

Shallow context is a problem when working with LLMs. I have been thinking about building up a repository whose sole purpose is recording specific pieces of information about my life for the sole purpose of creating deeper context for LLM interactions. An example of how this might work in practice: I'm interacting with an LLM for the first time. In order for its outputs to be helpful, I need to provide it with some foundational knowledge about me and perhaps about a specific project. Can you think of any technologies that already aim to do this? If they don't exist, how do you think I could implement this to make it as useful and versatile as possible? I would ideally like to have a central contextual repository but to be able to synthesise different pieces of context as required for a specific application.

# Output

While there aren't widely known technologies specifically designed for this purpose, your idea of creating a personal context repository for LLM interactions is innovative and potentially very useful. Here are some thoughts on how you could implement this concept:

## Existing Related Technologies

1. **Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) Tools**: While not specifically designed for LLM context, tools like Obsidian, Roam Research, or Notion can be used to create interconnected personal knowledge bases.

2. **Vector Databases**: Technologies like Pinecone or Weaviate are used for storing and retrieving embeddings, which could be adapted for personal context storage.

3. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: This technique, while not a specific technology, is used to enhance LLM responses with relevant information from a knowledge base.

## Implementation Ideas

To create a versatile and useful personal context repository for LLM interactions, consider the following approach:

1. **Central Repository Structure**:
   - Use a combination of structured and unstructured data storage.
   - Implement a tagging system for easy retrieval of related information.
   - Store information in markdown or JSON format for easy parsing.

2. **Content Categories**:
   - Personal Information: Basic details, preferences, important life events.
   - Professional Information: Skills, work history, current projects.
   - Knowledge Areas: Areas of expertise, interests, ongoing learning.
   - Relationships: Key people in your life, professional network.
   - Goals and Aspirations: Short-term and long-term objectives.

3. **Contextual Synthesis**:
   - Develop a system to dynamically combine relevant pieces of information based on the specific LLM interaction.
   - Use natural language processing to extract key concepts from your query and match them with relevant context.

4. **Integration with LLMs**:
   - Create an API that can be called before LLM interactions to provide relevant context.
   - Implement a prompt engineering system that automatically incorporates relevant context into LLM prompts.

5. **Regular Updates**:
   - Set up a system for easy addition and updating of information.
   - Implement version control to track changes over time.

6. **Privacy and Security**:
   - Ensure strong encryption for sensitive personal information.
   - Implement access controls if the system is used across multiple devices or platforms.

7. **Semantic Search Capability**:
   - Utilize embeddings to enable semantic search within your repository.
   - This allows for finding conceptually related information even if exact keywords don't match.

8. **Metadata and Timestamps**:
   - Include metadata for each piece of information, including creation date, last update, and relevance scores.
   - Use this metadata to prioritize more recent or more relevant information.

9. **Customizable Context Profiles**:
   - Create different context profiles for various types of interactions (e.g., professional, creative, personal).
   - Allow for quick switching between these profiles when interacting with LLMs.

10. **Feedback Loop**:
    - After each LLM interaction, have a mechanism to rate the usefulness of the provided context.
    - Use this feedback to improve context selection over time.

By implementing these features, you could create a powerful personal context repository that enhances your LLM interactions across various applications. This system would allow you to provide deep, relevant context to LLMs quickly, improving the quality and personalization of their outputs.

Remember to start small and iterate. Begin with a basic structure and a few key categories of information, then expand and refine the system based on your experiences and needs.
