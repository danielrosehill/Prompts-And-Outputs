# Prompt

Here's a question. I like using these python scripts to clean up data. But I don't always want to show the scripts that I've been using in the repos where I share the actual data. Can you suggest some method I can use to run my data processing scripts in a separate area/environment?

# Output

To keep your data processing scripts separate from your shared repos, while maintaining a clean workflow, there are several approaches you can use depending on your preferences and requirements. Here are a few methods:

### 1. **Use a Private Git Repository for Scripts**
   - **How it works**: Keep your data processing scripts in a **separate private repository**. You can use this private repo to track all your data cleaning scripts, while your actual data and results are stored in a public repo.
   - **Steps**:
     1. Create a private Git repository (e.g., on GitHub).
     2. Store and version your scripts in this private repository.
     3. Run the scripts locally or from the private repo without pushing the scripts to your public data repo.

### 2. **Run Scripts Locally or in a Cloud IDE**
   - **How it works**: Use a local environment or a cloud-based IDE (e.g., Jupyter, Google Colab) to run your scripts but don't include them in the data repository.
   - **Steps**:
     1. Set up a Python environment on your local machine or use a service like Google Colab.
     2. Keep your scripts out of the public data repo and run them from your environment whenever needed.
     3. Only push processed data or results to the public repo.

### 3. **Use Docker for Data Processing**
   - **How it works**: Run your scripts inside a **Docker container**. This keeps the scripts in an isolated environment, and the data processing can be done locally or remotely via containers. The scripts can be maintained separately from the actual data repo.
   - **Steps**:
     1. Write a `Dockerfile` that sets up the environment for running your scripts.
     2. Run the Docker container locally or on a remote server.
     3. Only commit the output (data) to the public repo, keeping the scripts inside the container.

   **Example `Dockerfile`:**
   ```dockerfile
   FROM python:3.9-slim
   WORKDIR /app
   COPY requirements.txt .
   RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
   COPY your_script.py .
   CMD ["python", "your_script.py"]
   ```

### 4. **Automate with CI/CD**
   - **How it works**: Use a **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline** (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI) to run your data processing scripts. The scripts can be stored in a private repo or encrypted environment variables while the actual processed data is pushed to the public repository.
   - **Steps**:
     1. Set up a CI/CD workflow that pulls the scripts from a private repository (or directly runs them via environment secrets).
     2. Ensure the processing is done during the CI/CD pipeline run.
     3. Push the processed data/results into the public repository automatically.
   
   **Example GitHub Actions workflow**:
   ```yaml
   name: Data Processing
   on: [push]
   jobs:
     process_data:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
       - name: Checkout code
         uses: actions/checkout@v2
       - name: Run Data Cleaning Script
         run: |
           git clone https://private-repo-url # clone private script repo
           python private-repo/script.py      # run the script
   ```

### 5. **Use a Python Virtual Environment or Conda Environment**
   - **How it works**: Keep your data processing scripts and their dependencies inside a Python virtual environment (or Conda). The environment can be separate from the actual data repo, and you can activate it whenever you need to run the scripts.
   - **Steps**:
     1. Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
     2. Store all your scripts inside this virtual environment.
     3. Activate the environment to run your scripts when needed without sharing them in the public repo.

### 6. **Utilize Remote Servers or JupyterHub**
   - **How it works**: Run your data processing scripts in **remote cloud servers** (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud) or in a **JupyterHub** setup that is not tied to your public repo.
   - **Steps**:
     1. Set up a remote server or JupyterHub instance for your data processing work.
     2. Keep your scripts there and run them as needed, away from the public data repository.
     3. Only push the final processed data to your public repo.

These methods allow you to keep your data processing scripts separate while still running them effectively in different environments. You can choose the one that best fits your workflow and security requirements.
