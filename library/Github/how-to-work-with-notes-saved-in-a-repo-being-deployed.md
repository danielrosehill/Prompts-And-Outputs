# Prompt

I'd like to create a single page HTML project to the internet using something like a static site generator. In my repos, I usually create a lot of notes folders. I usually put these thorugh Git because I might need them from mutiple computers. Is it a problem to have these in the codebase or is there a way that I can "hide" them from deployment so to speak?

# Output

Based on your query, it sounds like you want to deploy a single page HTML project using a static site generator, but you have some concerns about including your notes folders in the deployment. Here are some best practices and solutions to address this:

1. Use a .gitignore file:
   While you mentioned wanting to keep your notes in Git for syncing across computers, you can still selectively exclude them from your repository using a .gitignore file. This is useful if there are any sensitive or personal notes you don't want in version control[4].

2. Utilize a .surgeignore file:
   If you're using Surge for deployment, you can create a .surgeignore file in the root of your project. This file works similarly to .gitignore, allowing you to specify files and directories that should be ignored during deployment[4].

3. Set up a specific publish directory:
   Most static site generators and deployment platforms allow you to specify a publish or build directory. This is the directory that contains only the files needed for your website. For example, you mentioned setting the publish directory to ./dist in your Render settings[12].

4. Organize your project structure:
   Consider adopting a project structure that clearly separates your website files from your notes. For example:

   ```
   project/
   ├── src/           # Source files for your website
   ├── dist/          # Built files (what gets deployed)
   ├── notes/         # Your personal notes (not deployed)
   └── .gitignore     # Exclude sensitive files from Git
   ```

   This structure makes it easy to configure your static site generator to only build and deploy the contents of the src/ or dist/ directory[7].

5. Use environment-specific configurations:
   Many static site generators allow you to define different configurations for development and production environments. You can use this to ensure that your notes are available locally but not included in the production build[1].

6. Leverage static site generator features:
   Some static site generators have built-in functionality to exclude certain files or directories from the build process. For example, Jekyll automatically excludes files or folders that begin with an underscore (_)[3].

7. Consider using a separate repository for notes:
   If your notes are substantial and you want to keep them in version control but separate from your website code, you might consider creating a separate repository just for your notes.

By implementing these practices, you can keep your notes in your local development environment and version control while ensuring they don't get deployed with your website. This approach allows you to maintain your workflow of accessing notes from multiple computers while keeping your deployed site clean and focused on the necessary content[5][6].
