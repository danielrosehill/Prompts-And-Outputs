# Prompt

Can I use a Github repo to mirror my RSS feed subs between machines? And if so what's the best way to do that? Should I create the repo at .newsboat or does creating a repo within a dot file folder have potential consequences?

# Output

Yes, you can definitely use a GitHub repository to mirror your **Newsboat RSS feed subscriptions** (or any other configuration files) between machines. It’s a great way to keep your setup synchronized across multiple systems. However, there are some best practices to consider when doing this, particularly when using a Git repository in a dotfile directory like `.newsboat`.

### Approach Overview

You'll want to create a Git repository that tracks your **Newsboat configuration files**, which include:
- `~/.newsboat/urls` (where your RSS feeds are stored).
- Optionally, `~/.newsboat/config` (for custom keybindings or layout settings).

This setup will allow you to push changes to GitHub and pull them to other machines to stay in sync.

### Best Practices for Creating a Git Repository in a Dotfile Folder

1. **Creating a Repo in `.newsboat`**:
   - **Pros**: It's convenient because you’re directly tracking the configuration folder.
   - **Cons**: There are a few potential issues to consider:
     - GitHub and Git tools might not handle hidden folders (dotfiles) as well as non-hidden folders, depending on how they are configured (e.g., some Git GUI tools might not easily display dotfile repositories).
     - You may accidentally commit unnecessary or sensitive data if other config files are present in `.newsboat`.
     - Managing multiple dotfile folders separately can become cumbersome.

2. **Alternative: Use a Dedicated Dotfiles Repo**:
   - Many users prefer to have a **dedicated dotfiles repository** where they can manage all of their configuration files, including `.newsboat`, `.bashrc`, `.vimrc`, and others.
   - This way, you only track symlinks to these configuration files from a central `~/dotfiles` folder, which avoids creating Git repositories directly inside dotfile directories.

### Steps to Mirror Newsboat Configuration with GitHub

#### Option 1: Create a Git Repo Inside `.newsboat` Folder
1. **Initialize Git Inside `.newsboat`**:
   ```bash
   cd ~/.newsboat
   git init
   ```
   
2. **Create a `.gitignore` File (Optional but Recommended)**:
   - If you don’t want to track all files in `.newsboat`, create a `.gitignore` file to exclude specific files:
     ```bash
     # Example .gitignore
     cache.db
     queue
     ```

3. **Commit Your Newsboat Config Files**:
   ```bash
   git add urls config  # Add only the files you want to track
   git commit -m "Initial commit of Newsboat config"
   ```

4. **Push to GitHub**:
   - Create a GitHub repository (either public or private), then push your changes:
     ```bash
     git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/newsboat-config.git
     git branch -M main
     git push -u origin main
     ```

5. **Clone the Repository on Another Machine**:
   - On your other machine, clone the repository and pull it into your `.newsboat` directory:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/yourusername/newsboat-config.git ~/.newsboat
     ```

6. **Keep in Sync**:
   - Anytime you make changes on one machine, commit and push them to GitHub. Then, pull the changes on your other machine.

#### Option 2: Use a Centralized Dotfiles Repository (Recommended)
1. **Create a Central `dotfiles` Directory**:
   - Create a directory to track all your dotfiles (including Newsboat):
     ```bash
     mkdir ~/dotfiles
     cd ~/dotfiles
     ```

2. **Move Newsboat Config to the `dotfiles` Directory**:
   - Move your `.newsboat` directory into `~/dotfiles`:
     ```bash
     mv ~/.newsboat ~/dotfiles/newsboat
     ```

3. **Create a Symlink**:
   - Create a symlink from `~/.newsboat` to the `dotfiles` directory:
     ```bash
     ln -s ~/dotfiles/newsboat ~/.newsboat
     ```

4. **Initialize Git in the Dotfiles Directory**:
   - Initialize Git in `~/dotfiles`:
     ```bash
     cd ~/dotfiles
     git init
     git add newsboat
     git commit -m "Add Newsboat config"
     ```

5. **Push to GitHub**:
   - Create a repository on GitHub called `dotfiles` (this is a common convention).
   - Push your dotfiles repository:
     ```bash
     git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/dotfiles.git
     git branch -M main
     git push -u origin main
     ```

6. **Set Up Dotfiles on Other Machines**:
   - On your other machines, clone your `dotfiles` repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
     ```
   - Set up the symlink:
     ```bash
     ln -s ~/dotfiles/newsboat ~/.newsboat
     ```

7. **Keep in Sync**:
   - Push changes to your dotfiles repo anytime you modify your Newsboat feeds or config on one machine, then pull them on others.

### Which Approach is Best?

#### Option 1: Repo Inside `.newsboat`
- **Best for**: Users who only want to sync their Newsboat configs without worrying about other dotfiles.
- **Pros**: Simple and isolated to Newsboat; no need to manage symlinks.
- **Cons**: Less scalable if you decide to track more dotfiles later. Hidden folders can sometimes complicate Git management.

#### Option 2: Centralized Dotfiles Repo
- **Best for**: Users who want to manage **multiple dotfiles** (not just Newsboat).
- **Pros**: A scalable approach for managing all your configuration files, not just Newsboat. A cleaner structure with all config files in one place.
- **Cons**: Requires setting up symlinks, which may feel a bit more complex initially but pays off for larger config management.

### Conclusion

Both approaches work well, but if you think you'll expand beyond just syncing Newsboat feeds, the **centralized dotfiles repository** method is a cleaner and more scalable solution. If you prefer to keep it simple and focus only on **Newsboat**, creating a Git repo directly in `.newsboat` is perfectly fine.

If you go with the first option (repo in `.newsboat`), there shouldn't be any major issues, though some Git tools might not show dotfiles by default. With either approach, you can enjoy seamless syncing of your RSS feed subscriptions between machines!
