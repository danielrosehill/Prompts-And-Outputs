Currently, DALL-E does not directly support generating images with a transparent background. All generated images come with a standard background, typically filled with relevant contextual details. However, you can achieve a transparent background using the following approach:

1. **Use Image Editing Software**: After generating the image, you can use software like Adobe Photoshop, GIMP (which is free), or an online tool like remove.bg to manually remove the background and make it transparent.

2. **Use an AI Background Removal Tool**: Several online tools and services use AI to remove backgrounds. These can be particularly effective with relatively simple backgrounds.

If you'd like, I can guide you through how to use these tools to achieve the transparency effect you need!
