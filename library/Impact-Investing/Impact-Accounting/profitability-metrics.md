## 1. Net Profit (Net Income)

Net profit, also known as net income or the "bottom line," is the most direct measure of a company's profitability in dollar terms. It represents the total profit after all expenses, including operating costs, taxes, interest, and other non-operating costs, have been deducted from revenue. This figure is typically found at the bottom of the income statement and reflects the actual earnings available to shareholders.

- **Formula**:
  ```math
  \text{Net Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Expenses}
  ```
- **Use**: It shows how much money the company has earned in absolute terms after all costs are accounted for\[2]\[4].

## 2. Gross Profit

Gross profit measures the profit a company makes after deducting the cost of goods sold (COGS) but before accounting for other operating expenses like salaries, rent, and utilities. It focuses on profitability from core production activities.

- **Formula**:
  ```math
  \text{Gross Profit} = \text{Revenue} - \text{COGS}
  ```
- **Use**: Gross profit helps investors understand how efficiently a company produces its goods and services\[2].

## 3. Operating Profit (Operating Income)

Operating profit measures profitability from core business operations, excluding non-operating items such as taxes and interest. It is a useful metric for evaluating the company's ability to generate profits from its day-to-day activities.

- **Formula**:
  ```math
  \text{Operating Profit} = \text{Gross Profit} - \text{Operating Expenses}
  ```
- **Use**: This metric isolates operating performance from factors like debt and taxes, providing insight into operational efficiency\[3].

## 4. Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA)

EBITDA is a measure of profitability that excludes interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization to focus on a company's core operational performance.

- **Formula**:
  ```math
  \text{EBITDA} = \text{Operating Income} + \text{Depreciation and Amortization}
  ```
- **Use**: EBITDA is often used to compare companies across industries by removing the effects of financing and accounting decisions\[5].

These metrics provide different perspectives on profitability:

- *Net profit* gives a comprehensive view of overall profitability.
- *Gross profit* focuses on production efficiency.
- *Operating profit* provides insight into operational performance.
- *EBITDA* standardizes comparisons across companies by excluding non-operational factors.

Each can be useful depending on what aspect of profitability you are interested in evaluating.
