The **EBITDA** formula is used to measure a company's operating performance by excluding certain non-operating expenses. The formula is:

```math
\text{EBITDA} = \text{Operating Income (EBIT)} + \text{Depreciation} + \text{Amortization}
```

Alternatively, it can be calculated from net income as:

```math
\text{EBITDA} = \text{Net Income} + \text{Interest} + \text{Taxes} + \text{Depreciation} + \text{Amortization}
```

### Components of EBITDA:

1. **Earnings (Net Income)**: This is the company's profit after all expenses, including interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. It's the starting point for calculating EBITDA when using the net income method.
2. **Interest**: Interest expenses are related to the company’s financing decisions (e.g., loans or bonds). By excluding interest, EBITDA focuses on the company's operational performance without considering how it is financed\[1]\[2].
3. **Taxes**: Taxes vary depending on jurisdictions and tax strategies. By excluding taxes, EBITDA allows comparisons between companies in different regions or with different tax structures without the distortion caused by varying tax rates\[2]\[3].
4. **Depreciation**: Depreciation is a non-cash expense that spreads the cost of tangible assets (like machinery or buildings) over their useful lives. Since depreciation doesn't involve actual cash outflows, adding it back to earnings helps focus on cash-generating operations\[2]\[4].
5. **Amortization**: Amortization is similar to depreciation but applies to intangible assets like patents or trademarks. Like depreciation, it’s a non-cash expense and is added back to earnings to focus on operational performance\[2]\[4].

### Purpose of EBITDA

EBITDA provides a clearer view of a company’s core profitability by removing the effects of financing decisions (interest), tax strategies, and non-cash accounting entries (depreciation and amortization). It is especially useful for comparing companies across industries or regions and assessing operational efficiency without being influenced by external factors like capital structure or asset age\[1]\[3]. However, it's important to note that EBITDA does not account for capital expenditures or changes in working capital, which are critical for understanding long-term profitability and cash flow\[5].
