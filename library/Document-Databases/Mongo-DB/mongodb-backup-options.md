# Prompt

I'm using Mongo Atlas to host a MongoDB. If it works out, I'd like to take weekly full database backups (or incremental backups). I'm familiar with how this is done in SQL databases but not in Mongo. I'd like the backup target to be infrastructure that I manage. Perhaps a B2 bucket. Is this possible? Are there tools for this?

# Output

Yes, it's definitely possible to take regular backups of your MongoDB Atlas database and store them in your own infrastructure, such as a Backblaze B2 bucket. Here's an overview of how you can approach this:

1. MongoDB Atlas Built-in Backups:
   Atlas already provides automated backups, but these are stored within Atlas itself. However, you can use these as a starting point.

2. Manual Backup Process:
   You can create a manual backup process using MongoDB tools and scripts:

   a. Use mongodump:
      mongodump is a utility for creating binary exports of your database content.

   Example command:
   ```
   mongodump --uri "mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster-url>/myDatabase" --out /path/to/backup
   ```

   b. Compress the backup:
   ```
   tar -czvf backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz /path/to/backup
   ```

   c. Upload to B2:
   You can use the B2 CLI tool or a tool like rclone to upload the compressed backup to your B2 bucket.

3. Automation:
   You can create a script that combines these steps and schedule it to run weekly using a cron job or a task scheduler.

4. Tools and Services:

   a. SnapShooter: As mentioned in one of the search results, SnapShooter is a service that can automate MongoDB backups to various cloud storage providers, including Backblaze B2.

   b. mongodump and s3cmd: You can use mongodump to create the backup and s3cmd to upload it to B2 (which is S3-compatible).

   c. Custom scripts: You can write your own scripts using languages like Python or Bash to handle the backup process and upload to B2.

5. Considerations:
   - Ensure your backup process doesn't impact the performance of your production database.
   - Use appropriate authentication and encryption when transferring and storing backups.
   - Regularly test your backup and restore process.
   - Consider incremental backups if your database is large and full backups take too long.

6. Example Script Structure:
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   
   # Set variables
   MONGO_URI="mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster-url>/myDatabase"
   BACKUP_DIR="/path/to/local/backup"
   B2_BUCKET="my-b2-bucket"

   # Create backup
   mongodump --uri "$MONGO_URI" --out "$BACKUP_DIR"

   # Compress backup
   tar -czvf "$BACKUP_DIR/backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz" "$BACKUP_DIR"

   # Upload to B2
   b2 upload_file $B2_BUCKET "$BACKUP_DIR/backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz" "backups/backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz"

   # Clean up local files
   rm -rf "$BACKUP_DIR"
   ```

Remember to secure your script and ensure it's running in a secure environment, as it will contain sensitive information like database credentials.

This approach gives you control over your backups and allows you to store them in your own infrastructure while leveraging the MongoDB Atlas service for your primary database needs.
