# Prompt

Great. I know that MongoDB are always trying to get more users. Do they happen to have any startup incubator or accelerator to whom I could pitch this idea? Perhaps even to see if they might wish to sponsor a cluster in the event that I open source the project?

# Output

Based on the information provided in the search results and the image, MongoDB does indeed have programs and partnerships aimed at supporting startups. Here are some relevant points:

1. MongoDB for Startups Program: MongoDB offers a program specifically designed for early-stage startups. This program provides:
   - Free MongoDB Atlas credits (up to $500, valid for 12 months)
   - Technical advice and support
   - Co-marketing opportunities
   - Access to MongoDB's partner network

2. Eligibility:
   - Startups at Series A stage or earlier
   - Building a product or service (not for consultancies or agencies)
   - First-time participants in the program
   - Must have a live website and valid company LinkedIn profile

3. Application Process:
   - You can apply directly through MongoDB's website
   - Alternatively, you can get a referral from a VC, accelerator, or incubator partner

4. Partnerships:
   - MongoDB works with VCs, accelerators, and incubators
   - They mention partnering with "the best in the industry"

5. AI Startups Track:
   - There's mention of an AI Startups track that offers extra credits

Given this information, here are some suggestions for pitching your Output Hub project:

1. Apply directly to the MongoDB for Startups program through their website.
2. If you're associated with any VCs, accelerators, or incubators, ask them if they have a partnership with MongoDB and can refer you.
3. Highlight the AI/LLM aspects of your project, as this might make you eligible for their AI Startups track.
4. When pitching, emphasize how your project could showcase MongoDB's capabilities in managing and organizing AI-generated content.
5. Consider reaching out to MongoDB's partnerships team to discuss the possibility of open-sourcing your project with their sponsorship.

Remember, while MongoDB offers support for startups, they don't explicitly mention providing free clusters for open-source projects. However, the credits and support they offer through their startup program could be a good starting point for your project.
