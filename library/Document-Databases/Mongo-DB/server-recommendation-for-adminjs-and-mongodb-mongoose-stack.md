# Prompt

do any of these servers make more or less sense for my output hub idea (mongodb + mongoose)

yarn add @adminjs/express                # for Express server
$ yarn add @adminjs/nestjs                 # for Nest server
$ yarn add @adminjs/hapi                   # for Hapi server
$ yarn add @adminjs/koa                    # for Koa server
$ yarn add @adminjs/fastify

# Output

Based on your Output Hub project requirements (using MongoDB with Mongoose) and the options you've listed, here's an analysis of which server frameworks might be most suitable:

1. Express (@adminjs/express):
   - Pros: Most popular and widely used Node.js framework, extensive community support, simple to use and set up.
   - Cons: Minimal structure out of the box, which might require more manual organization for larger projects.
   - Recommendation: Excellent choice for your Output Hub project, especially if you prefer flexibility and simplicity.

2. NestJS (@adminjs/nestjs):
   - Pros: Provides a structured, opinionated framework with built-in support for TypeScript and dependency injection. Good for large, scalable applications.
   - Cons: Steeper learning curve compared to Express, might be overkill for smaller projects.
   - Recommendation: Good choice if you anticipate your Output Hub growing into a large, complex application.

3. Hapi (@adminjs/hapi):
   - Pros: Known for its security features and plugin system.
   - Cons: Less popular than Express, which might mean fewer resources and third-party integrations.
   - Recommendation: Viable option, but might not offer significant advantages over Express for your specific use case.

4. Koa (@adminjs/koa):
   - Pros: Lightweight and flexible, created by the team behind Express.
   - Cons: Smaller ecosystem compared to Express.
   - Recommendation: Could work well, but doesn't offer significant advantages over Express for your MongoDB/Mongoose setup.

5. Fastify (@adminjs/fastify):
   - Pros: Focuses on providing maximum performance and low overhead.
   - Cons: Smaller community compared to Express, potentially fewer resources available.
   - Recommendation: Good choice if performance is a top priority, but may not offer significant benefits for your current needs.

Given your requirements (MongoDB + Mongoose) and considering that you're building an admin panel (Output Hub), I would recommend either Express or NestJS:

1. Express: If you want a simple, flexible setup that's easy to get started with and has a vast ecosystem. It works great with MongoDB and Mongoose, and there are plenty of resources available.

2. NestJS: If you anticipate your project growing in complexity and you want a more structured, scalable approach from the start. It also works well with MongoDB and Mongoose, and provides additional features that might be beneficial for larger projects.

Both of these options have excellent integration with AdminJS, which you seem to be considering for your admin panel. Express might be the best starting point unless you have specific reasons to opt for a more complex framework like NestJS.
