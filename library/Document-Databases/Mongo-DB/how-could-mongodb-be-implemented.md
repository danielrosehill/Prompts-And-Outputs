# Prompt

If I were to go with MongoDB ... what kind of frontend is supported? Are there any knowledge management tools that perhaps already use MongoDB and which I could adapt for this purpose? How would I link prompts and outputs using this approach?
# Output

If you decide to go with MongoDB for your Output Hub system, you have several options for the frontend and potential existing tools to adapt. Here's an overview of how you could approach this:

Frontend Options:

1. Web-based Frontend:
   - React.js or Vue.js: These popular JavaScript frameworks work well with MongoDB, especially when combined with a Node.js backend (MERN or MEVN stack).
   - Angular: Another robust option for building dynamic web applications.

2. Desktop Application:
   - Electron: Allows you to build cross-platform desktop apps using web technologies.

3. Mobile Applications:
   - React Native or Flutter: For building mobile apps that can interact with your MongoDB backend.

Knowledge Management Tools using MongoDB:

While there aren't many off-the-shelf knowledge management tools specifically designed for LLM prompt and output management, some existing tools that use MongoDB and could potentially be adapted include:

1. Outline: An open-source wiki and knowledge base that uses MongoDB. It's not specifically for LLM outputs, but its structure could be adapted.

2. Bookstack: Another open-source knowledge base system that can be configured to use MongoDB.

3. Trilium Notes: An open-source hierarchical note-taking application that can use MongoDB as its backend.

Linking Prompts and Outputs in MongoDB:

To link prompts and outputs using MongoDB, you could use a document reference approach. Here's a simplified schema example:

```javascript
// Prompts Collection
{
  _id: ObjectId("..."),
  content: "What is the capital of France?",
  createdAt: ISODate("2024-09-28"),
  outputs: [ObjectId("..."), ObjectId("...")] // References to Output documents
}

// Outputs Collection
{
  _id: ObjectId("..."),
  promptId: ObjectId("..."), // Reference to the Prompt document
  content: "The capital of France is Paris.",
  createdAt: ISODate("2024-09-28"),
  metadata: {
    model: "GPT-4",
    temperature: 0.7,
    // ... other metadata
  }
}

// Agents Collection
{
  _id: ObjectId("..."),
  name: "Geography Expert",
  configuration: { ... },
  prompts: [ObjectId("..."), ObjectId("...")] // References to Prompt documents
}
```

In this structure:
- Prompts have an array of references to their outputs.
- Outputs have a reference to their parent prompt.
- Agents have an array of references to the prompts they've used.

To implement this:

1. When creating a new output, you'd add its ObjectId to the `outputs` array of the corresponding prompt document.
2. To retrieve a prompt with all its outputs, you'd use MongoDB's aggregation framework to perform a lookup:

```javascript
db.prompts.aggregate([
  {
    $match: { _id: promptId }
  },
  {
    $lookup: {
      from: "outputs",
      localField: "outputs",
      foreignField: "_id",
      as: "outputDocuments"
    }
  }
])
```

This approach allows for flexible querying and maintains the relationships between your documents. You can easily extend this schema to include more metadata, tags, or other features as needed for your Output Hub system.
