# Prompt
I've set up my MongoDB cluster. Can you help me to set up the basic tables I'm going to need for my output hub project?

# Output
Certainly! I'd be happy to help you set up the basic collections (MongoDB's equivalent of tables) for your Output Hub project. Based on our previous discussions about the project, here's a suggested structure for your MongoDB collections:

1. Agents Collection:
```javascript
db.createCollection("agents", {
   validator: {
      $jsonSchema: {
         bsonType: "object",
         required: ["name", "configuration"],
         properties: {
            name: {
               bsonType: "string",
               description: "Name of the agent"
            },
            description: {
               bsonType: "string",
               description: "Description of the agent"
            },
            configuration: {
               bsonType: "object",
               description: "Configuration details for the agent"
            },
            createdAt: {
               bsonType: "date",
               description: "Date the agent was created"
            },
            updatedAt: {
               bsonType: "date",
               description: "Date the agent was last updated"
            }
         }
      }
   }
})
```

2. Prompts Collection:
```javascript
db.createCollection("prompts", {
   validator: {
      $jsonSchema: {
         bsonType: "object",
         required: ["title", "content", "status"],
         properties: {
            title: {
               bsonType: "string",
               description: "Title of the prompt"
            },
            content: {
               bsonType: "string",
               description: "Content of the prompt"
            },
            agentId: {
               bsonType: "objectId",
               description: "Reference to the agent used"
            },
            status: {
               enum: ["Drafting", "Run"],
               description: "Status of the prompt"
            },
            createdAt: {
               bsonType: "date",
               description: "Date the prompt was created"
            },
            updatedAt: {
               bsonType: "date",
               description: "Date the prompt was last updated"
            }
         }
      }
   }
})
```

3. Outputs Collection:
```javascript
db.createCollection("outputs", {
   validator: {
      $jsonSchema: {
         bsonType: "object",
         required: ["content", "promptId"],
         properties: {
            content: {
               bsonType: "string",
               description: "Content of the output"
            },
            promptId: {
               bsonType: "objectId",
               description: "Reference to the prompt used"
            },
            agentId: {
               bsonType: "objectId",
               description: "Reference to the agent used"
            },
            metadata: {
               bsonType: "object",
               properties: {
                  programmingLanguages: {
                     bsonType: "array",
                     items: {
                        bsonType: "string"
                     }
                  }
               },
               description: "Additional metadata for the output"
            },
            createdAt: {
               bsonType: "date",
               description: "Date the output was created"
            }
         }
      }
   }
})
```

4. FollowUpActivities Collection:
```javascript
db.createCollection("followUpActivities", {
   validator: {
      $jsonSchema: {
         bsonType: "object",
         required: ["outputId", "description", "status"],
         properties: {
            outputId: {
               bsonType: "objectId",
               description: "Reference to the related output"
            },
            description: {
               bsonType: "string",
               description: "Description of the follow-up activity"
            },
            status: {
               enum: ["To Do", "In Progress", "Completed"],
               description: "Status of the follow-up activity"
            },
            createdAt: {
               bsonType: "date",
               description: "Date the activity was created"
            },
            updatedAt: {
               bsonType: "date",
               description: "Date the activity was last updated"
            }
         }
      }
   }
})
```

To create these collections in your MongoDB cluster, you can use a MongoDB client like MongoDB Compass or the mongo shell. Copy each `db.createCollection()` command and run it in your MongoDB environment.

After creating these collections, you might want to add some indexes to improve query performance:

```javascript
db.agents.createIndex({ name: 1 })
db.prompts.createIndex({ status: 1 })
db.prompts.createIndex({ agentId: 1 })
db.outputs.createIndex({ promptId: 1 })
db.outputs.createIndex({ agentId: 1 })
db.followUpActivities.createIndex({ outputId: 1 })
db.followUpActivities.createIndex({ status: 1 })
```

These collections and indexes provide a solid foundation for your Output Hub project. They allow for storing and efficiently querying agents, prompts, outputs, and follow-up activities, with appropriate relationships between them.
