# Prompt

Is there a formal way of mapping out project specs? For example some kind of template that could be used to capture this particular project as we've explored and specced it so far?

# Output

Yes, there are formal ways of mapping out project specifications, often referred to as **project specifications documents** or **project requirements templates**. These templates help you structure the goals, scope, and technical aspects of a project clearly, ensuring that all stakeholders are aligned. Here’s a basic template that can be adapted for your project:

### **1. Project Overview**
   - **Project Name**: Custom Notification System for Geopolitical Threat Monitoring in Israel
   - **Project Manager/Owner**: [Your Name/Organization]
   - **Date**: [Start Date]
   - **Version**: [Current Version]
   - **Summary**: A system that monitors news and official government alerts regarding geopolitical events in Israel. The system will use an automation platform (Pipedream) to trigger real-time notifications based on imminent threats and daily news summaries.

---

### **2. Objectives**
   - **Primary Goal**: To provide timely alerts about geopolitical events, especially imminent threats to Israel, by monitoring official Israeli warnings and relevant news outlets.
   - **Secondary Goal**: To send a daily digest of relevant news for ongoing situational awareness.

---

### **3. Key Components**
   - **News Sources**:
     - Official Israeli government channels (RSS feeds, APIs).
     - Key news outlets (e.g., Jerusalem Post, Reuters, Times of Israel).
     - Aggregated news data (using APIs like Currents API or NewsAPI).
   
   - **Automation Platform**: 
     - **Platform**: Pipedream
     - **Primary Functions**:
       1. Fetch news and government alerts via API or RSS.
       2. Parse articles with GPT to analyze the urgency of threats.
       3. Trigger notifications for imminent threats and generate daily digests.
       4. Use Pipedream’s email/SMS services for alerts.

---

### **4. Features**
   - **Real-Time Alerts**:
     - Keywords and sentiment analysis (e.g., "missile attack," "imminent threat").
     - Use GPT to classify the urgency of the news and government data.
     - Trigger immediate email/SMS alerts to users for imminent threats.

   - **Daily Digest**:
     - Scheduled task at a set time (e.g., once every 24 hours).
     - Aggregates less urgent news for daily email updates.
  
   - **Custom Notifications**:
     - Allow users to opt in for either real-time alerts or daily digests.

---

### **5. Functional Requirements**
   - **Integration**:
     - News sources: Integrate with Currents API or NewsAPI for daily monitoring.
     - Government Alerts: Integrate with Israeli government feeds.
     - Parsing and Analysis: Use OpenAI’s GPT via API for analyzing content and determining threat levels.
   
   - **Triggers**:
     - For real-time alerts: Must detect keywords related to imminent threats.
     - For daily summaries: Aggregate all relevant news over the past 24 hours.

---

### **6. Non-Functional Requirements**
   - **Performance**: Must handle real-time data without significant delays (notifications should go out within minutes of detection).
   - **Scalability**: Should be able to handle increased news feed sources and subscribers without loss in speed or reliability.
   - **Reliability**: Ensure the system runs 24/7 and sends accurate, timely notifications.
   - **Security**: Protect user data and ensure notifications are sent only to authorized subscribers.

---

### **7. Milestones**
   - **Phase 1**: Design architecture and set up Pipedream workflows.
   - **Phase 2**: Integrate news and government data sources.
   - **Phase 3**: Set up real-time alert mechanisms.
   - **Phase 4**: Implement daily digest system.
   - **Phase 5**: Test system functionality and scalability.
   - **Phase 6**: Deploy to users and monitor performance.

---

### **8. Testing and Evaluation**
   - **Unit Testing**: Test each component of the system (news feed, government alerts, GPT parsing, notifications).
   - **Integration Testing**: Ensure seamless functioning between different platforms and APIs.
   - **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**: Allow beta users to test real-time alerts and daily digest features.

---

### **9. Risks and Mitigation**
   - **Risk**: Data overload from too many news sources.
     - **Mitigation**: Implement filters and throttling mechanisms to handle large volumes.
   - **Risk**: Delayed notifications due to API failure or delays.
     - **Mitigation**: Set up fallback systems to retry API calls or use alternative data sources.

---

### **10. Stakeholders**
   - **Owner/Client**: [Your Name or Organization]
   - **Development Team**: Pipedream workflow developers, API integration specialists, AI engineers (for GPT integration).
   - **End Users**: People interested in staying informed about geopolitical events in Israel.

---

### **11. Budget and Resources**
   - **Automation Costs**: Pipedream and API subscription costs (e.g., Currents API).
   - **AI Costs**: OpenAI GPT API usage fees (based on API calls).
   - **Email/SMS Costs**: Twilio or SendGrid for sending notifications.

---

### **12. Timelines**
   - **Estimated Start Date**: [Insert Date]
   - **Estimated Completion Date**: [Insert Date]
