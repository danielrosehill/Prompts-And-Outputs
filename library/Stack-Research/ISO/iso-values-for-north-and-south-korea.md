The **ISO 3166-1 alpha-2** codes and **official names** for **South Korea** and **North Korea** are as follows:

1. **South Korea**:
   - **Official Name**: **Republic of Korea**
   - **ISO 3166-1 Alpha-2 Code**: **KR**

2. **North Korea**:
   - **Official Name**: **Democratic People's Republic of Korea**
   - **ISO 3166-1 Alpha-2 Code**: **KP**

These official names are often shortened in common usage, but in international contexts, the full names are used along with their corresponding ISO codes. If you encounter variations like "**Korea, Rep.**" or "**Korea, Dem. People's Rep.**," these can be standardized as follows:
- "Korea, Rep." maps to **Republic of Korea** (**KR**).
- "Korea, Dem. People's Rep." maps to **Democratic People's Republic of Korea** (**KP**).

If you need to update any data or apply corrections to ensure consistency, it's best to use these official names and codes.
