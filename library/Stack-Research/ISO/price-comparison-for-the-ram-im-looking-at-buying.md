# Prompt

Any chance you could do some price comparison. 2 x 16GB of this RAM is 530 NIS What's the price on New Egg And can you find any better deals in Israel?

# Output

On **Newegg**, the **Kingston ValueRAM 16GB DDR5 4800MHz (Model: KVR48U40BS8-16)** is currently available for **$56.45 - $59.99** with **free shipping** depending on the seller. This is equivalent to approximately **210 - 225 NIS** per module, making the total for **2 x 16GB** around **420 - 450 NIS**, which is **significantly cheaper** than the **530 NIS** price you found locally in Israel【38†source】【39†source】.

### Better Deals in Israel:
To find local deals, you could try price comparison websites like **Zap** (www.zap.co.il), which is popular in Israel for electronics. Checking local retailers like **KSP**, **Ivory**, or smaller computer hardware shops might also yield competitive prices or special promotions that could be better than the current price you found.

Would you like me to help find specific local deals in Israel or provide more links to online stores?
