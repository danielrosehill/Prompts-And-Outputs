#### **1\. Pricing:**

**Tooljet:**

\- **Open Source Version:** Free. You can self-host Tooljet on your server, and it's entirely free to use with all core features.

\- **Cloud Version:**

\- **Free Tier:** Includes basic features, suitable for small teams or individuals.

\- **Pro Tier:** Typically around $10-$20 per user per month, depending on the specific plan and features.

\- **Enterprise Tier:** Custom pricing for larger teams or specific enterprise needs, including advanced security and compliance features.

**JetAdmin:**

\- **Free Version:** JetAdmin offers a free plan that includes basic features, ideal for small teams.

\- **Pro Version:** Starts at $24 per user per month, offering advanced features, integrations, and support.

\- **Enterprise Version:** Custom pricing, which includes premium support, dedicated infrastructure, and advanced customization.

#### **2\. User Base:**

\- **Tooljet:** As an open-source platform, Tooljet has a growing and active community. The open-source nature of Tooljet contributes to its popularity, especially among developers who prefer to customize and self-host their solutions. However, its user base is smaller compared to some more established tools.

\- **JetAdmin:** JetAdmin has a more established user base, particularly among businesses looking for no-code/low-code internal tools. It is widely used by companies needing quick and customizable internal tools, which has contributed to its broader adoption in various industries.

#### **3\. Features and Flexibility:**

**Tooljet:**

\- **Customization:** Highly customizable due to its open-source nature, allowing developers to modify and extend the platform as needed.

\- **Community Support:** Strong community support with contributions from developers who continually add new features and improvements.

\- **Integration:** Supports a wide range of integrations with databases, APIs, and third-party services.

\- **Self-Hosting:** Gives you full control over your data and infrastructure, making it a preferred choice for those concerned about privacy and data sovereignty.

**JetAdmin:**

\- **User Experience:** Offers a polished and user-friendly interface with pre-built templates that make it easy to set up admin panels quickly.

\- **Support:** More structured support options, especially in the paid tiers, with access to premium features and assistance.

\- **Enterprise Features:** Includes advanced features like role-based access control, custom branding, and integration with enterprise systems.

\- **Speed of Deployment:** Quick to deploy with ready-to-use templates and drag-and-drop functionality, which can be a significant time-saver for non-technical users.

#### **4\. Additional Considerations:**

\- **Security:** JetAdmin, particularly in its enterprise offering, provides more robust security features out-of-the-box, which might be critical depending on your project’s needs. Tooljet’s self-hosting option allows you to manage security internally, which can be a plus or a minus depending on your team's expertise.

\- **Ease of Use:** JetAdmin is generally more user-friendly, especially for non-technical users. Tooljet may require more technical know-how, particularly if you opt for the self-hosted version.

\- **Scalability:** JetAdmin’s enterprise solutions offer scalability features that might be beneficial if your GPT Workbench project needs to support a large number of users or complex workflows. Tooljet’s open-source model allows you to scale at your own pace, but it might require more hands-on management.

\- **Community vs. Vendor Support:** Tooljet’s community-driven approach offers flexibility but may lack the immediate support that JetAdmin's paid plans provide. If quick support and a polished product are priorities, JetAdmin might be the better choice.

### **Conclusion:**

\- **Tooljet** might be better if you’re looking for an open-source, highly customizable solution, especially if you prefer self-hosting and have the technical resources to manage it.

\- **JetAdmin** could be more suitable if you’re seeking a polished, user-friendly tool with robust support and enterprise-level features, even at a higher cost.

For the GPT Workbench project, consider your team’s technical expertise, the importance of customization, and whether you prefer a community-driven or a vendor-supported platform.
