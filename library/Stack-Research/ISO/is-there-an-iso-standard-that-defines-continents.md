Correct, **ISO** does not define a standard that directly categorizes countries into continents. ISO standards like **ISO 3166-1** and **ISO 3166-2** focus on defining country codes and subdivisions but do not classify countries into continents or geographical regions.

For continent-based classifications, organizations like the **United Nations** provide the **UN M49 standard**, which categorizes countries into macro-geographical regions, subregions, and continents. Other resources like the **Geonames database** or the **CIA World Factbook** offer similar continent-country mappings, but these are not part of the ISO standards.

So, while ISO standards provide a consistent and recognized system for identifying countries, you would need to refer to non-ISO standards, like UN M49, or other geographical datasets for associating countries with continents.
