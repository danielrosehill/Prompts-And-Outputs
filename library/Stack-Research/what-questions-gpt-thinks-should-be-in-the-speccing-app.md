Hereâ€™s a list of key questions that would be useful to include in your software spec generation app. These questions cover the fundamental aspects of defining software requirements:

### 1. **General Overview**
   - What is the main purpose of the software?
   - Who are the target users for this software?
   - What are the primary use cases for the software?
   - What problem or pain point does the software solve?

### 2. **Key Features**
   - What are the must-have features or functionalities?
   - Are there any specific integrations required (e.g., APIs, third-party services)?
   - Should the software support multiple languages or be localized?
   - Are there any particular workflows or processes the software needs to handle?

### 3. **User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX)**
   - How important is user interface (UI) design in this software?
   - Do you have any design preferences or specific UI requirements?
   - Should the software be mobile-friendly or responsive across devices?
   - What are the expected levels of accessibility support (e.g., ADA compliance)?

### 4. **Platform and Deployment**
   - Which platforms should the software run on (e.g., Linux, Windows, Android, Web)?
   - Will the software be cloud-based, on-premises, or hybrid?
   - Are there any specific hosting or infrastructure requirements?
   - Does the software need to work offline or support syncing when online?

### 5. **Performance and Scalability**
   - What are the expected performance requirements (e.g., speed, responsiveness)?
   - How many concurrent users should the software be able to handle?
   - Should the software be built with scalability in mind for future growth?
   - Are there any specific response time or latency requirements?

### 6. **Security and Compliance**
   - Are there specific security requirements (e.g., encryption, 2FA, OAuth)?
   - Does the software need to comply with any regulatory standards (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA)?
   - How will user data be handled and protected?
   - What are the backup and disaster recovery requirements?

### 7. **Data and Storage**
   - What kind of data will the software need to store and process?
   - What are the database requirements (e.g., relational, NoSQL)?
   - How much data is expected to be stored, and what are the retention policies?
   - Should the software provide data export or reporting functionalities?

### 8. **Collaboration and Communication**
   - Should the software allow for collaboration between users?
   - Is real-time communication or messaging required within the software?
   - Should the software integrate with communication tools (e.g., Slack, email)?

### 9. **Customization and Extensibility**
   - Should the software support customization for users (e.g., themes, layouts, preferences)?
   - Is there a need for a plugin or modular system to extend functionality?
   - Should the software allow for integrations with other tools via APIs?

### 10. **Maintenance and Support**
   - How will software updates and patches be managed?
   - Should the software provide in-app customer support or documentation?
   - What is the expected level of technical support required?

### 11. **Budget and Timeline**
   - What is the budget for this project (if applicable)?
   - What is the expected timeline for delivery and key milestones?
   - Are there any specific deadlines or release dates that must be met?

### 12. **Competitive Analysis**
   - Are there any similar software solutions already on the market?
   - What are the competitive advantages or unique features of this software?

### 13. **User Feedback and Iteration**
   - Will there be a process for gathering user feedback after launch?
   - How will future versions and improvements be managed?

### Optional Questions for Specific Scenarios
- **For AI-based Software**: 
  - What AI or machine learning models are required?
  - Should the software support real-time AI processing or batch predictions?

- **For SaaS Products**: 
  - What subscription models should be supported (e.g., monthly, yearly)?
  - Are there any customer onboarding processes or demos required?
