To achieve a **full publishing solution** where you can both **edit and visualize data** (with a backend for managing the data and a frontend for displaying it), you’re right that tools like Kepler.gl are more focused on visualizing data but lack the CMS-like features you’re looking for.

Here are some platforms that provide **both data management (backend)** and **data visualization/publishing (frontend)**:

### 1. **Superset + Strapi (Headless CMS)**:
   - **Superset** is an open-source data exploration platform that can serve as your **frontend for data visualization**, including geospatial and analytical visualizations.
   - **Strapi** is a **headless CMS** that allows you to manage data (in JSON format) in the backend. It provides an API that can be queried by the frontend (Superset) to update the visualizations dynamically.

   - **Why it's a good fit**: You can build dashboards in Superset that visualize **country-specific impact metrics**, while using Strapi to edit and manage datasets.
   - **How it works**: Superset fetches the data from Strapi's API and renders it into interactive charts, tables, or maps.
   - **Example use case**: A site with country-based **carbon pricing coefficients** that updates dynamically when you modify the data in Strapi.

   - **Website**: [Superset](https://superset.apache.org/), [Strapi](https://strapi.io/)

### 2. **NocoDB + Next.js (Data Management and Static/Server-Side Rendering)**:
   - **NocoDB** is an open-source platform that turns your database (like MySQL, Postgres) into a **smart spreadsheet-like interface**. It provides a way to **manage and edit data** visually.
   - Combine it with **Next.js** as the **frontend**, which supports both static and server-side rendering, and can fetch and display data from NocoDB's API.
   
   - **Why it's a good fit**: NocoDB gives you a flexible backend where you can edit and maintain your dataset (such as impact metrics or carbon pricing coefficients) like a **spreadsheet**. Next.js provides a powerful frontend for building **interactive websites** with charts and maps.
   - **How it works**: Use Next.js to query the NocoDB API and render the visualizations dynamically using libraries like **D3.js** or **Leaflet** for maps.
   - **Example use case**: A website that presents **interactive charts** and **geovisualizations** of impact metrics, all managed from the NocoDB backend.

   - **Website**: [NocoDB](https://www.nocodb.com/), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)

### 3. **Metabase (Full-Stack Platform for Data Visualization and Reporting)**:
   - **Metabase** is an open-source tool for building **interactive dashboards and reports** from your data, and it includes a lightweight backend for managing queries and datasets.
   
   - **Why it's a good fit**: Metabase can serve as both the **backend** (for querying and managing data) and the **frontend** (for visualizing it). It supports embedding **interactive visualizations** on public websites.
   - **How it works**: You can upload datasets, query them, and create visualizations (including geospatial maps). Then, embed these visualizations in a custom website or dashboard.
   - **Example use case**: A public-facing dashboard that tracks **environmental and social impact metrics** with interactive maps, while using Metabase as the backend for managing the datasets.

   - **Website**: [Metabase](https://www.metabase.com/)

### 4. **Retool + Gatsby (Data Management and Static Site Generator)**:
   - **Retool** is a tool for building internal admin panels, where you can **manage and interact with your data** visually. 
   - Use **Gatsby** as the frontend, which is a **static site generator** that can build fast websites and pull in data from Retool's API.
   
   - **Why it's a good fit**: Retool provides a user-friendly interface for managing and updating datasets. You can use Gatsby to build a public-facing site that consumes Retool's API for **dynamic content** and visualizations.
   - **How it works**: Manage your dataset (carbon pricing, etc.) in Retool, and pull the data into Gatsby for rendering in charts or maps.
   - **Example use case**: A fast website that displays **nation-specific impact metrics**, while using Retool to manage and update the data.

   - **Website**: [Retool](https://retool.com/), [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/)

### 5. **AirTable + D3.js (Spreadsheet-Like Data Backend with Custom Visualization)**:
   - **Airtable** is a **spreadsheet-like backend** for managing data that offers API access, making it easy to query and update data.
   - Pair it with **D3.js** for the frontend to build custom data visualizations that are fetched from Airtable’s API.

   - **Why it's a good fit**: Airtable is user-friendly and provides an easy way to manage data. You can create **custom interactive visualizations** using **D3.js** or another JavaScript library.
   - **How it works**: Update data in Airtable, which is then fetched via the API to render dynamic visualizations on your website.
   - **Example use case**: A dynamic site with interactive visualizations, such as maps or graphs for environmental/social impact metrics, managed from Airtable.

   - **Website**: [Airtable](https://airtable.com/), [D3.js](https://d3js.org/)

### Conclusion:
- **NocoDB + Next.js** or **Superset + Strapi** would give you both **backend data management** and **frontend visualizations**.
- **Metabase** offers an all-in-one solution for data management and interactive dashboards.
- **Retool + Gatsby** provides a **hybrid approach** with data management in Retool and a static or server-rendered website via Gatsby.

These solutions would allow you to both **edit and manage the dataset** and present it to the public with dynamic visualizations like maps, charts, and dashboards. Let me know which approach resonates most with you, and I can help you explore it further!
