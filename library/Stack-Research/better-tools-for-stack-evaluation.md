# Prompt

As you may have noticed, I do a lot of stack research. I tend to have very specific requirements and I like going through comprehensive evaluation lists. Can you think of any platforms I might be able to leverage for this purpose? I'm wary of doing simple Google searches because so many businesses buy fake "reviews" which really distorts things. Ideally, I'd love something like an AI enhanced tool or just something optimised for this purpose ... whereby I could give it a list of requirements and come up with a shortlist of tools to check out
