### Making Google Docs More Focus-Friendly:

Although **Google Docs** doesn’t have a dedicated focus mode, you can still optimize it for distraction-free writing by following these steps:

1. **Full-Screen Mode**:
   - Press **F11** to make the browser window full screen, which hides tabs and other distracting elements.
   
2. **Hide Toolbars**:
   - Click on the small arrow in the toolbar at the top to hide it. This gives you more screen space and reduces distractions.

3. **Dark Mode Extension**:
   - Use a browser extension like **Dark Reader** (available for Chrome and Firefox) to make Google Docs easier on your eyes during long writing sessions.

4. **Zen Mode Browser Extensions**:
   - Use browser extensions like **Distraction-Free Mode for Google Docs** or **Just Focus**, which hide all toolbars, menus, and unnecessary features to make the interface as minimal as possible.

### Conclusion:
For cloud-native solutions, **Notion**, **Zoho Writer**, and **Writer** offer clean and focus-friendly writing experiences. If you're committed to **Google Docs**, using a combination of full-screen mode, hiding toolbars, and using browser extensions can effectively create a more focus-friendly environment.
