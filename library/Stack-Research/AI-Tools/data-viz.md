You are looking for AI tools or LLMs that can generate data visualizations like bar charts based on natural language input. Several options are available that cater to different needs, from simple chart generation to more complex, interactive dashboards. Here are some of the best tools and platforms that specialize in this:

## 1. Bricks

Bricks is a powerful AI-driven tool designed for creating a wide range of data visualizations, including bar charts, using natural language queries. It offers:

- AI-driven chart recommendations
- Interactive and customizable visualizations
- Natural language support for querying data\
  This makes it an excellent choice for users who want to explore their data intuitively without needing technical expertise\[1].

## 2. ThoughtSpot

ThoughtSpot leverages LLMs like GPT and Google PaLM to allow users to ask complex questions in natural language and receive interactive visualizations, including bar charts, in return. It also provides AI-powered insights and anomaly detection, making it ideal for business users who need quick answers from large datasets\[2].

## 3. Luzmo

Luzmo integrates GPT models into its platform to allow users to generate charts directly from natural language prompts. You can connect your data source, describe what you need (e.g., "create a bar chart of sales by region"), and Luzmo will generate the visualization automatically. This tool is particularly useful for those looking to create interactive dashboards with minimal effort\[4].

## 4. NL4DV (Natural Language Toolkit for Data Visualization)

NL4DV is a Python-based toolkit that allows developers to create visualizations from natural language queries. It takes a dataset and a plain-language query as input and returns a chart specification in JSON format (using Vega-Lite), which can be rendered into various types of visualizations, including bar charts\[5]. This tool is more suited for developers who want to integrate natural language interfaces into their own systems.

## 5. Chat2Plot

Chat2Plot is an open-source library that uses LLMs to generate visualizations from natural language queries without directly executing code. It converts user instructions into high-level chart specifications in JSON format (e.g., Vega-Lite), which can then be rendered into actual visualizations using libraries like Plotly or Altair\[8]. This tool is secure and flexible, allowing users to refine their charts interactively.

## 6. ChartGPT

ChartGPT is a research project specifically designed to generate charts from abstract natural language inputs. It breaks down the chart generation process into smaller steps, ensuring accurate visualization even when user inputs are vague or complex\[3]. While still in development, it shows great promise for handling ambiguous queries.

## 7. Qlik Sense

Qlik Sense uses AI-driven features like "Insight Advisor Chat," which allows users to generate visualizations by asking questions in natural language. This platform is ideal for enterprise-level users looking to visualize large datasets while also benefiting from AI-powered insights\[7].

### Summary

If you're looking for an easy-to-use tool with strong AI capabilities:

- **Bricks** and **ThoughtSpot** are great for business users requiring interactive dashboards.
- **Luzmo** offers seamless integration with databases and quick chart generation.
- For developers looking to build custom solutions, **NL4DV** and **Chat2Plot** provide flexibility and control over the visualization process.

These tools allow you to define your requirements in natural language and have the system automatically generate the desired visualizations, making them highly accessible even for non-technical users.
