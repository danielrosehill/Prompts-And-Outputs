# Prompt

I'm often tasked at work with reading long email threads. Sometimes it's difficult to pick out the key details. Can you think of any AI tool that might be helpful for this purpose - I could give it a long nested conversation and it could produce a sort of summary of the key details in the back and forth?

# Output

Yes, there are several AI tools that can help summarize long email threads, picking out the key details and presenting them in a more digestible format:

### 1. **ChatGPT or GPT-4 (OpenAI)**:
   - **How it helps**: You can input long email threads into a GPT-powered tool (like ChatGPT), and it can provide a concise summary of the conversation, highlighting key points and decisions. If you’re handling nested email threads, GPT can recognize the structure and summarize accordingly.
   - **How to use**: You can provide it with context like "summarize this thread and highlight key decisions or actions." It will then focus on extracting important exchanges and outcomes.

### 2. **Summari**:
   - **What it does**: Summari is an AI-powered tool specifically designed for summarizing long-form content. While it's generally marketed for articles and documents, you can use it for email threads as well.
   - **How it helps**: Summari provides a high-level overview, helping you focus on the most important parts of long emails. You can copy-paste the email into the tool, and it will summarize key themes and points.

### 3. **TL;DR (Chrome Extension)**:
   - **What it does**: TL;DR is an AI-powered Chrome extension that works on emails and web content. You can use it directly on your Gmail or other email platforms to get a quick summary of long email threads.
   - **How it helps**: It provides a concise summary by pulling out the most critical information from email exchanges, so you don’t have to scroll through each nested message.

### 4. **SaneBox's SaneDigest**:
   - **What it does**: While not strictly a summarization tool, **SaneBox** helps filter and organize your emails into digest form, prioritizing the most important messages. It doesn't summarize conversations but helps in managing and prioritizing long email threads.
   - **How it helps**: This can be useful in reducing clutter, so you only need to summarize the most important emails.

### 5. **Microsoft Outlook’s AI-Powered Insights**:
   - **What it does**: Microsoft Outlook’s AI insights features can scan emails for important tasks, people, and deadlines, summarizing them within the inbox. If you use Outlook for work, this feature helps detect critical parts of the conversation and key actions.
   - **How it helps**: Automatically surfaces action items from email conversations, which can make summarizing long threads easier.

### 6. **Otter.ai**:
   - **What it does**: While traditionally used for transcribing and summarizing meetings, Otter.ai can be used to summarize long text inputs like emails or conversations, providing a structured summary.
   - **How it helps**: Input your email thread into Otter.ai, and it will provide a summarized transcript of the key points, much like it would with a meeting.

### 7. **Superhuman**:
   - **What it does**: Superhuman is an email app designed for professionals who need to move quickly through emails. While it doesn't offer direct summarization, it has features like **snippets** that help summarize key points from a conversation.
   - **How it helps**: The app allows you to manage long threads more easily with built-in tools to cut through clutter and focus on key parts.

By using one of these tools, you can quickly generate summaries of email conversations, saving time and helping you focus on key details and decisions.
