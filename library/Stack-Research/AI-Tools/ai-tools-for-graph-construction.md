 Yes, there are emerging AI-powered systems designed to help with precisely this kind of knowledge graphing and relationship mapping. They analyze content to detect themes, connections, and patterns, helping automate the organization of knowledge repositories. Here are some tools and approaches that could provide the intelligent structuring you’re looking for:

### 1. **Mem.ai**
   - **Description**: Mem.ai is an AI-driven note-taking tool that automatically organizes notes by identifying themes, entities (like people or topics), and relationships. It generates connections between related content over time without requiring manual tagging.
   - **AI Capabilities**: Mem’s AI detects similar notes, makes suggestions based on previous inputs, and surfaces related information as you write or search. It creates an evolving network of connections based on your interactions.
   - **Best For**: Users who want an automated, minimal-effort setup for organizing and recalling ideas without manual linking.

### 2. **Rewind.ai (MacOS)**
   - **Description**: Although Rewind is more of a "time machine" for your digital life, it could be useful for quickly retrieving past content and linking contextually related items. It records everything you work on (screens, documents) and uses AI to surface related activities based on time and content.
   - **AI Capabilities**: Rewind uses powerful search and indexing to retrieve anything you’ve seen, written, or discussed, linking it by context. It's great for surfacing forgotten content based on the specific “train of thought” you were on at a particular time.
   - **Best For**: Users who prefer a retrospective, time-based approach to knowledge retrieval with AI-driven linking.

### 3. **Heptabase with AI Integration**
   - **Description**: Heptabase is a visual knowledge base that creates cards on a 2D map (a visual graph). While it’s not inherently AI-driven, it has an API that can integrate with GPT-3 or similar LLMs for automated summarization and content linking.
   - **AI Capabilities**: Using the API and language models, Heptabase can analyze your notes, summarize them, and suggest links, providing a semi-automated way to organize content on a graph-based map.
   - **Best For**: People who want the flexibility to customize AI integration and manually validate connections without a fully hands-off approach.

### 4. **Kumu for AI-Assisted Knowledge Mapping**
   - **Description**: Kumu is a powerful tool for creating networked maps that visualize relationships. It doesn’t have built-in AI for automating connections, but you can pair it with AI-assisted tagging and analysis tools to identify themes and relationships for Kumu’s knowledge maps.
   - **AI Capabilities**: By pairing Kumu with tools like GPT-based analysis scripts (which you could run in Python, for example), you could use AI to generate summaries, tags, and suggested connections, which Kumu can map visually.
   - **Best For**: Users open to some initial setup, who want fine-grained control over how connections are visualized while leveraging AI for insight discovery.

### 5. **Obsidian with AI Plugins**
   - **Description**: Obsidian’s plugin ecosystem includes emerging AI integrations, such as Smart Connections and DataView with GPT-3. These plugins provide automated linking, recommendations, and content analysis, helping generate connections between notes based on context.
   - **AI Capabilities**: With plugins, Obsidian can suggest related notes, surface themes, and link ideas without requiring manual tagging. Some plugins also allow advanced querying, making it possible to pull in related content automatically.
   - **Best For**: Obsidian users who want to keep their system but add AI features to improve automated linking and search.

### 6. **Cortex (Beta)**
   - **Description**: Cortex is an AI-based platform designed to create a networked knowledge graph from your notes, articles, and web clips, providing automatic connections and context as you build out ideas.
   - **AI Capabilities**: Cortex’s AI processes your notes to identify themes, categorize them, and build connections between related topics and ideas without manual input.
   - **Best For**: People interested in a knowledge graph that continuously grows and adapts, generating connections without much user intervention.

### Additional Suggestions
   - **Experiment with GPT-4 or Claude API Scripts**: If you’re open to some customization, you could use language models like GPT-4 or Claude to parse notes and outputs for themes, summaries, and suggested links. This approach is a bit more technical but allows full control over how AI analyzes your data.
   - **Tagging Automation**: Tools like Zapier, Make, or custom Python scripts can auto-tag notes by topic or category before adding them to a repository, which can streamline AI-driven searches and visualizations.

Using one of these systems or tools should allow you to access the automated, intuitive organization you’re looking for, freeing up time to focus on new discoveries and less on manual curation.
