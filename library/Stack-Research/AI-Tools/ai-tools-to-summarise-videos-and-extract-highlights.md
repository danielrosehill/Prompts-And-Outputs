 # Prompt

I have a to do list item to watch a video playlist that's on YouTube. It's long and boring. Are there any AI tools I can us to "watch" the videos and find some highlights from them / provide timestamps

# Output

Here are some AI tools and methods you can use to summarize YouTube videos and extract highlights with timestamps:

1. **YouTube Transcript Feature**:
   - Many YouTube videos have autogenerated transcripts. You can access these by clicking the three dots below the video (if available) and selecting "Open transcript." You can then search for key terms or skim through the text to find highlights.

2. **Descript**:
   - Descript is a powerful audio and video editing tool that allows you to transcribe videos and edit them like a document. You can upload your video or provide the YouTube link, and it will generate a transcript. You can then highlight parts of the transcript to create summaries and capture timestamps.

3. **Scribe**:
   - Scribe is another tool that allows you to create transcripts from videos. You can provide the YouTube URL, and it will automatically transcribe the content. This can help you find important moments without watching the entire video.

4. **Genei**:
   - Genei is an AI tool designed for research and note-taking. While itâ€™s primarily for written content, it has features to summarize and highlight content, which might work if you can get the video transcript first.

5. **Sonix.ai**:
   - Sonix is an AI transcription service that can transcribe audio and video files. You can upload your YouTube video or provide a link, and it will create a transcript, allowing you to search for key moments easily.

6. **Otter.ai**:
   - Otter.ai is another transcription service that works well for meetings, lectures, and videos. You can upload audio from the video or provide a link. It generates transcripts and allows you to highlight important sections.

7. **Video Highlighting Tools**:
   - Some tools specialize in creating highlights from long videos, such as **Veed.io** or **Kapwing**. These tools might offer features to summarize or highlight key moments, but you may need to watch parts of the video.

8. **AI Summarizers**:
   - You can also use AI summarizers, such as **ChatGPT** or other text summarization tools, to summarize the transcript after you've obtained it from the video.

### Using These Tools

- **Transcribe the Video**: Start by using a transcription tool to convert the video to text.
- **Identify Key Points**: Use the transcript to skim for important topics or sections you find interesting or relevant.
- **Create a Summary**: If the tool allows, generate a summary or highlight important timestamps based on your notes.
