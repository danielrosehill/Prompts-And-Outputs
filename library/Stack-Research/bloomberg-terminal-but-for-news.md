# Prompt

Is there something like the Bloomberg Terminal but for general news that is used by newsrooms? I recall using something like it years ago

# Output

What you are describing is likely a **news aggregation terminal** or specialized software used by journalists and newsrooms to monitor news in real-time. Here are some systems that provide a Bloomberg Terminal-like experience for news, typically used by professionals in the media industry:

The platform aggregates content from multiple Reuters reporters worldwide, as well as from other partner news agencies. It’s highly customizable and allows for efficient, near-instant monitoring, similar to the Bloomberg Terminal but focused on news.

### **2. Factiva by Dow Jones**
- **Factiva**, operated by Dow Jones, is a comprehensive news database that aggregates content from thousands of global news sources, including major newspapers, magazines, and online sites. Newsrooms use it to track **breaking news, company information**, and broader current events. It provides a terminal-like interface with advanced search capabilities, allowing journalists to track trends and analyze news coverage effectively.

### **3. Bloomberg News Terminal**
- Bloomberg itself has **Bloomberg News** as part of its overall Bloomberg Terminal offering. It offers a news ticker that provides general news (not just financial), which is helpful for keeping an eye on major world events as they unfold.

### **10. Dataminr**
- **Dataminr** is another powerful tool for real-time news monitoring, used by newsrooms to get ahead of breaking stories. It uses AI to scour public data, such as social media posts, and provides alerts when significant events or trends emerge. It's used by major news organizations to keep track of potential breaking news stories as they develop.

### **4. Elasticsearch with Kibana (DIY Custom Solution)**
- **Cost Estimate**: This is a **highly customizable solution**, but it requires a more hands-on approach. **Elasticsearch** is free as an open-source project, but hosting costs and infrastructure will add up. If hosted on a **cloud provider** (e.g., AWS, Azure), the cost may be approximately **$100 to $500 per month**. If you’re building this yourself, it requires significant technical expertise.

### **5. SentiOne**
- **Cost Estimate**: SentiOne offers various pricing tiers. The **basic plans** start at around **$300 per month**, while more comprehensive enterprise-level plans can cost up to **$1,500 per month** or more, depending on the number of features and users.
