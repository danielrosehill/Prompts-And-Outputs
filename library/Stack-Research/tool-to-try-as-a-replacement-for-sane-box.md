# Prompt

I recently tried out Sane Box to optimise my email management but I really didn't like it. I found the UI very basic. I'm trying to find something like an AI enhanced tool which makes it easy for me to focus on key emails - and perhaps even help me to unsubsribe from or block nuisance spammers. Can you suggest another tool to try?
