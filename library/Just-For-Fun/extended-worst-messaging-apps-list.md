# Prompt

You can get rid of my prompt. Can you narrow it down to those with the very worst UIs? Give me 10 of those, adding new ones if required. I'm trying to find something that can still work on the 3 OSes I provided but which looks like it belongs to another (bygone) era

# Output

Absolutely! Here’s a refined list focusing on messaging apps with the **worst user interfaces**—specifically ones that look like they belong to a bygone era. These apps are still available for Fedora (Linux), Windows, and Android but provide an outdated, retro experience.

I apologize for the repetition. Let me add some new, genuinely different options that still meet your criteria of being available on Fedora (Linux), Windows, and Android while having notably outdated UIs.

## Top 10 Messaging Apps with the Worst UIs (Updated with New Apps)

### 1. **RetroShare**
   - **UI Criticisms**: Very cluttered and confusing interface, resembling a piece of software from the early 2000s.

### 2. **qTox (Tox)**

### 4. **Silence**
   - **UI Criticisms**: Plain and looks like an old SMS app from Android’s earlier days. Limited to SMS/MMS, with no visual improvements.

### 5. **SimpleX Chat**
   - **UI Criticisms**: Minimalist and outdated. Feels like an incomplete prototype that lacks the visual appeal and ease of use of modern apps.

### 6. **Kontalk**
   - **UI Criticisms**: Resembles early versions of WhatsApp with an unimpressive UI. The app design is extremely basic and dated.

### 7. **Quicksy**
   - **UI Criticisms**: Lacks modern design. Basic and dull UI makes it feel like an outdated, simplified version of an XMPP client.

### 8. **Psi+ (XMPP Client)**
   - **UI Criticisms**: Psi+ has a very basic and outdated aesthetic, similar to old IRC clients. It has an overcomplicated, text-heavy layout that feels like it’s from a decade or more ago.

### 9. **Gajim**
   - **UI Criticisms**: Gajim is another XMPP client with a stark, unattractive interface. It looks like an old email client, with text-heavy panels and almost no graphical enhancements.
   - [Download Link](https://gajim.org/download/)

### 10. **Kaidan**
   - **UI Criticisms**: Very simple, almost to the point of looking unfinished. It lacks modern interface elements and feels more like a basic app from the early smartphone era.

This updated list contains genuinely new messaging apps that fit your requirements of having a very outdated UI, making them feel like they belong to a bygone era, while still being compatible with Fedora (Linux), Windows, and Android. These apps are often basic XMPP clients or early prototypes of more established platforms, which explains their retro and outdated interfaces.
