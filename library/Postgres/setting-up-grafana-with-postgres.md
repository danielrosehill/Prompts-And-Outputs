# Prompt

Let's do Postgres. Can you give me a guide for setting this up. And let me know what type of VPS to use and what kind of config is best

# Output

Setting up Grafana with PostgreSQL on Ubuntu requires a few steps, including configuring PostgreSQL, installing Grafana, and choosing the right VPS for your setup. I'll walk you through the installation and configuration process, and I'll also provide recommendations for the VPS type and configuration.

### Step 1: Choose the Right VPS

When choosing a VPS for running Grafana and PostgreSQL, consider your workload and the number of users who will be accessing the service. Here are some guidelines based on different use cases:

1. **Small deployment (personal use, <10 dashboards, few users):**
   - **CPU**: 1 vCPU
   - **RAM**: 2 GB
   - **Storage**: 20-40 GB SSD
   - **OS**: Ubuntu 20.04 or 22.04 LTS
   - **Example VPS providers**: DigitalOcean, Linode, AWS Lightsail, or Hetzner.
   
2. **Medium deployment (team use, 10-50 dashboards, moderate traffic):**
   - **CPU**: 2 vCPUs
   - **RAM**: 4 GB
   - **Storage**: 40-80 GB SSD
   - **OS**: Ubuntu 20.04 or 22.04 LTS
   - **Network**: Consider adding backups and monitoring.
   
3. **Large deployment (many dashboards, high traffic, enterprise use):**
   - **CPU**: 4-8 vCPUs
   - **RAM**: 8-16 GB
   - **Storage**: 100 GB+ SSD (RAID recommended for redundancy)
   - **OS**: Ubuntu 20.04 or 22.04 LTS
   - **Network**: Private networking, backups, monitoring, and firewall configurations.

For a small-to-medium deployment, a VPS with **2 vCPUs, 4 GB of RAM, and 40-80 GB of SSD storage** should work well for Grafana and PostgreSQL.

### Step 2: Install PostgreSQL on Ubuntu

1. **Update your system:**
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get upgrade
   ```

2. **Install PostgreSQL:**
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib
   ```

3. **Start and enable PostgreSQL service:**
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start postgresql
   sudo systemctl enable postgresql
   ```

4. **Set up a new PostgreSQL database and user for Grafana:**
   - Log in to the PostgreSQL shell as the `postgres` user:
     ```bash
     sudo -u postgres psql
     ```
   - Create a new database for Grafana:
     ```sql
     CREATE DATABASE grafana;
     ```
   - Create a new PostgreSQL user for Grafana with a password:
     ```sql
     CREATE USER grafanauser WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'your_password';
     ```
   - Grant privileges to the new user on the Grafana database:
     ```sql
     GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE grafana TO grafanauser;
     ```
   - Exit the PostgreSQL prompt:
     ```sql
     \q
     ```

### Step 3: Install Grafana on Ubuntu

1. **Add the Grafana repository:**
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install -y software-properties-common
   sudo add-apt-repository "deb https://packages.grafana.com/oss/deb stable main"
   wget -q -O - https://packages.grafana.com/gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -
   sudo apt-get update
   ```

2. **Install Grafana:**
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install grafana
   ```

3. **Configure Grafana to use PostgreSQL as the database:**
   - Open the Grafana configuration file:
     ```bash
     sudo nano /etc/grafana/grafana.ini
     ```
   - Find the `[database]` section and update the values to use PostgreSQL:
     ```
     [database]
     type = postgres
     host = 127.0.0.1:5432
     name = grafana
     user = grafanauser
     password = your_password
     ssl_mode = disable
     ```

4. **Start and enable Grafana:**
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start grafana-server
   sudo systemctl enable grafana-server
   ```

### Step 4: Configure Firewall

If your VPS has a firewall (which it should for security), make sure to allow traffic on the Grafana port (default `3000`) and PostgreSQL port (`5432`) if PostgreSQL needs to be accessible remotely.

1. **Allow Grafana (port 3000):**
   ```bash
   sudo ufw allow 3000/tcp
   ```

2. **Allow PostgreSQL (port 5432) only if needed for external connections:**
   ```bash
   sudo ufw allow 5432/tcp
   ```

3. **Enable the firewall:**
   ```bash
   sudo ufw enable
   sudo ufw status
   ```

---

### Step 5: Access Grafana

1. Open your browser and go to `http://<your-server-ip>:3000`.

2. The default login credentials are:
   - Username: `admin`
   - Password: `admin` (you'll be prompted to change this after the first login).

### Step 6: Fine-Tuning Configuration

1. **PostgreSQL Tuning for Performance:**
   - Depending on your VPS size and usage, you can adjust PostgreSQL settings to optimize performance:
     ```bash
     sudo nano /etc/postgresql/12/main/postgresql.conf
     ```
   - Key parameters to adjust for better performance on a medium VPS:
     ```
     shared_buffers = 512MB
     work_mem = 16MB
     maintenance_work_mem = 128MB
     effective_cache_size = 1GB
     ```

   Restart PostgreSQL after making changes:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart postgresql
   ```

2. **Monitoring and Backups:**
   - Set up monitoring for your Grafana and PostgreSQL installation to track CPU, memory, and storage usage.
   - Ensure you have a backup plan for PostgreSQL, especially for production setups:
     ```bash
     sudo pg_dump -U grafanauser grafana > /path/to/backup.sql
     ```

### Conclusion:

For a typical deployment, using a VPS with **2 vCPUs, 4 GB RAM, and 40-80 GB SSD** should provide a stable environment for Grafana and PostgreSQL, especially for small-to-medium workloads. You can adjust PostgreSQL settings for better performance, especially if you expect higher traffic or have many dashboards.
