To disable SSL for PostgreSQL in your setup, you need to add the `PGSSLMODE=disable` environment variable. Since the environment variables for PostgreSQL are already defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file, you can add `PGSSLMODE` in the `environment` section of the **Outline** service, not in the PostgreSQL service.

Hereâ€™s an example of how to add the `PGSSLMODE` variable to your Outline service in your `docker-compose.yml`:

### Example (Adding to Outline Service)
```yaml
services:
  outline:
    image: docker.getoutline.com/outlinewiki/outline:latest
    env_file: ./docker.env
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    volumes:
      - storage-data:/var/lib/outline/data
    depends_on:
      - postgres
      - redis
    environment:
      PGSSLMODE: disable  # Add this line to disable SSL for PostgreSQL
```

### Where to Add in Your `docker-compose.yml`

You would add this `PGSSLMODE` variable under the `environment` section for the **Outline** service. If you have a separate environment file (e.g., `.env` or `docker.env`), you can also add this variable there.

### Steps:
1. Add `PGSSLMODE: disable` under the `environment` block for the **Outline** service (not PostgreSQL).
2. Save the changes to your `docker-compose.yml` file.
3. Restart the services:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

This should prevent the SSL connection error and allow Outline to connect to the PostgreSQL database without requiring SSL.
