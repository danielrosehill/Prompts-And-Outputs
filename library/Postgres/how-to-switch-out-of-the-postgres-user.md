# Prompt

Great. I'm now user postgres. My default username is daniel. How do I switch back in Linux?

# Output

To switch back to your default user `daniel` from the `postgres` user in Linux, you can use the `exit` command or the `logout` command. Here are the steps:

### Method 1: Using `exit`

1. **Type `exit`**:
   Simply type the following command in your terminal and press Enter:
   ```bash
   exit
   ```
   This command will log you out of the `postgres` user and return you to the previous user (in this case, `daniel`).

### Method 2: Using `logout`

1. **Type `logout`**:
   Alternatively, you can type:
   ```bash
   logout
   ```
   This will have the same effect as the `exit` command.

### Method 3: Switch User Command

If you want to switch back to your user without logging out completely, you can use the `su` command:

1. **Switch back to `daniel`**:
   ```bash
   su daniel
   ```
   You may be prompted to enter the password for `daniel`.

### Important Notes

- **Using `exit` or `logout`** will close the current shell session and return you to the previous user.
- If you need to perform actions as `daniel` while still in the `postgres` session, using `su` is more convenient.
