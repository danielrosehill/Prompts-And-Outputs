**Summary:** You are asking if there is a way to securely access a PostgreSQL database hosted on a Google Cloud Platform VM without opening access over port 5432.

### Secure Methods to Access PostgreSQL Without Directly Opening Port 5432

1. **Cloudflare Tunnel**
   - Since you are already using Cloudflare Tunnel for other services, you can leverage it to securely proxy connections to your PostgreSQL server. This way, the database remains inaccessible directly over the internet, and only traffic passing through the Cloudflare Tunnel can reach it.
   - **How It Works**: Install the Cloudflare Tunnel client (`cloudflared`) on your VM and configure it to forward PostgreSQL connections through a specific domain or subdomain, secured by Cloudflare's Access service.
   - **Benefits**: This setup allows you to control who can access the database via Cloudflare Access policies, such as requiring login via SSO or multi-factor authentication.

2. **SSH Tunneling**
   - **SSH Tunneling (Port Forwarding)** can securely connect to your PostgreSQL server without exposing port 5432. You set up an SSH tunnel from your local machine to the GCP VM, forwarding the PostgreSQL port through the SSH connection.
   - **How It Works**:
     1. Ensure SSH access to the VM is set up.
     2. Use the command: 
        ```bash
        ssh -L 5432:localhost:5432 <username>@<vm-external-ip>
        ```
     3. Connect to `localhost:5432` on your local machine as if it were the PostgreSQL server.
   - **Benefits**: The database port remains closed on the internet, and the connection is encrypted via SSH.

3. **Cloud SQL Proxy (if considering managed Cloud SQL)**
   - For managed Google Cloud SQL instances (though you mentioned a VM), you can use the **Cloud SQL Proxy** to securely connect without opening ports.
   - **How It Works**: Cloud SQL Proxy uses IAM to authenticate and encrypt connections. You can download and run the proxy on your local machine or within your applicationâ€™s environment.
   - **Benefits**: No need to manage SSH tunnels; authentication is managed via IAM, ensuring only authorized users or service accounts can connect.

4. **VPN Connection**
   - Set up a **Virtual Private Network (VPN)** between your local network and the Google Cloud VPC hosting your VM. This allows you to access the PostgreSQL instance as if it were on a local network, without exposing port 5432 to the internet.
   - **How It Works**: Use Google Cloud VPN to create a site-to-site connection between your on-premises network and the GCP VPC. Alternatively, you can use third-party VPN solutions installed on the VM.
   - **Benefits**: Secure, encrypted connection; useful for organizations that need persistent, secure access to cloud resources.

5. **IAM-Based Access Control with Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP)**
   - Use **Google Cloud's Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP)** to control access to your VM and set up a secure tunnel. IAP can proxy SSH connections, and you can then forward a port from your local machine to PostgreSQL over this secured SSH session.
   - **How It Works**: 
     1. Enable IAP on the GCP VM instance.
     2. Use the `gcloud` CLI to initiate a tunnel:
        ```bash
        gcloud compute ssh <instance-name> --tunnel-through-iap -- -L 5432:localhost:5432
        ```
     3. Connect to `localhost:5432` on your local machine.
   - **Benefits**: Access control is managed via Google Cloud IAM, making it easy to specify who can connect, with all connections logged for audit purposes.

### Recommendations
For a **secure and managed** approach, consider using **IAP tunneling** or **Cloudflare Tunnel** integrated with Access. These methods provide excellent security, ease of management, and the ability to enforce stringent access controls. If you prefer a simple, lightweight solution, **SSH Tunneling** is also a reliable and secure option.
