# Prompt

Great. My hesitation about using Google Cloud APIs was always that I was afraid of racking up huge bills. But I've set up some pretty good billing alerts so hopefully that won't be a concern. If I wanted to monitor the spend in the early stages though is there any way to configure something like a daily alert to let me know how much I spent?

# Output

Yes, you can set up **daily billing alerts** in Google Cloud to monitor your spending and stay on top of any unexpected charges. Here are a few ways you can achieve this:

### 1. **Set Up Budget and Alerts in Google Cloud**:
You can configure a **budget** in Google Cloud and set up notifications that send alerts when spending reaches a certain threshold. Although budgets are typically set to trigger based on percentage thresholds, you can still use this feature to track spending early on.

#### Steps:
1. **Create a Budget**:
   - Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
   - Navigate to **Billing** > **Budgets & alerts**.
   - Click **Create Budget** and follow the prompts to create a budget for your project.
   - Set the budget amount to your desired monthly spending limit (e.g., $50, $100).
   
2. **Set Alerts**:
   - You can set alerts at specific percentages of your budget (e.g., 25%, 50%, etc.).
   - Select **Email notifications** and enter your email to receive alerts when spending reaches the configured thresholds.

3. **Enable Daily Summary Reports**:
   - While budget alerts are triggered based on percentage thresholds, you can enable **daily cost export** to monitor actual spending on a daily basis (explained below).

### 2. **Daily Spending Reports via Google Cloud Billing Export**:
To track spending daily, you can use the **Billing Export** feature to export detailed billing data to **BigQuery** or **Cloud Storage**. From there, you can automate reports or alerts to get a daily update on your spending.

#### A. **Export Billing Data to BigQuery**:
1. Go to the **Google Cloud Console**.
2. Navigate to **Billing** > **Billing export**.
3. Under **BigQuery export**, enable the option to export your billing data to a BigQuery dataset.
   - This will export detailed billing data, including daily cost breakdowns.
   
4. In **BigQuery**, you can write queries to analyze spending and generate daily reports. You can schedule queries in BigQuery to run daily and send a notification via email or other services using a webhook or other integration.

#### B. **Export Billing Data to Cloud Storage**:
Alternatively, you can export billing data to Cloud Storage and process it with other tools to generate alerts.

1. Go to **Billing** > **Billing export**.
2. Under **Cloud Storage export**, configure a Cloud Storage bucket to store billing files (in CSV or JSON format).
3. Write a script to process the daily billing data from the CSV/JSON file and send an email or alert based on the current day’s spend.

### 3. **Using Google Cloud Monitoring for Billing Alerts**:
You can also configure **Cloud Monitoring** to send daily spending alerts. Here's how:

1. **Enable Cloud Monitoring**:
   - Go to the [Google Cloud Monitoring Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/monitoring).
   - Select **Metrics Explorer** and search for `billing` in the metrics list.

2. **Create an Alert Policy**:
   - In the Monitoring Dashboard, go to **Alerting** and click **Create Policy**.
   - Define a condition based on billing metrics (such as total cost or cost by service).
   - Set the condition to trigger daily and notify you via email or SMS.

### 4. **Billing Reports via Email**:
You can set up daily billing reports via **Cloud Billing Reports** and request these to be emailed to you.

1. Go to **Billing** > **Reports**.
2. Use the report feature to filter for daily costs, specific projects, or services.
3. You can manually check this, or automate it with one of the above methods.

### Summary of Approaches:
- **Budget & Alerts**: Set budget thresholds and receive notifications via email.
- **Billing Export to BigQuery**: Export daily spending data and analyze with queries or schedule automated daily reports.
- **Cloud Monitoring**: Use metrics explorer to create custom alerting policies that monitor daily spending.
- **Daily Reports via Email**: Export detailed billing data or use a Cloud Monitoring alert to generate a daily report.

With these methods, you’ll have full control over your GCP spending, and daily alerts will ensure you’re always aware of costs as they accumulate.
