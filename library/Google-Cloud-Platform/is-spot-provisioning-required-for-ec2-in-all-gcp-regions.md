Google Cloud Platform (GCP) does not require **spot provisioning** (or Preemptible VMs) specifically for **E2 instances** in all regions. Instead, the availability of Preemptible VMs and their pricing can vary by region and instance type.

### Key Points About E2 Instances and Spot Provisioning:

1. **Preemptible VMs Availability**:
   - **E2 Instances**: Preemptible E2 instances are available in most regions, but there may be specific regions where Preemptible options are not available. Always check the [GCP documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/preemptible) for the latest availability and supported regions for Preemptible VMs.

2. **Regional Differences**:
   - Some regions may have different capacities for Preemptible VMs due to resource availability. If you choose a region with high demand or limited resources, Preemptible instances may be harder to obtain.

3. **No Requirement for Spot Provisioning**:
   - You are not required to use Preemptible VMs for E2 instances; you can deploy standard E2 instances at the regular on-demand pricing without any spot provisioning.

4. **Checking Availability**:
   - When creating a new instance, you can view the options for Preemptible VMs in the GCP Console. If Preemptible options are not available in your selected region, it will not show up as an option during instance creation.

5. **Considerations for Preemptible Instances**:
   - If you plan to use Preemptible instances for cost savings, ensure your workloads can handle interruptions, as they can be preempted at any time based on resource availability.

### Summary
You do not have to use spot provisioning (Preemptible VMs) for E2 instances across all regions; it is an option available based on your specific region's support. Always verify the current offerings and availability directly in the GCP console or documentation for the most accurate information regarding Preemptible VMs.
