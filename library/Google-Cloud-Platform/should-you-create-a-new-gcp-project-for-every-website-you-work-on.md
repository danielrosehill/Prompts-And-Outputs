In Google Cloud Platform (GCP), creating a **new project for each website** or major application is a common and recommended approach, especially for these reasons:

### 1. **Resource and Billing Isolation**
   - Each GCP project provides **separate billing** and usage tracking, making it easier to monitor costs and allocate budgets on a per-project basis. This isolation also simplifies estimating costs for individual sites and tracking spend over time.
   - Projects also keep resources (VMs, databases, storage buckets) isolated, which prevents accidental modifications across unrelated sites.

### 2. **Access Control and Security**
   - Projects enable **individualized Identity and Access Management (IAM)** policies. You can grant access specifically to those who need it for each project, reducing the risk of unintended access to other projects or websites.
   - **Separation of Environments**: With each site in its own project, GCP services and configurations (e.g., API keys, service accounts) remain separate, reducing security risks associated with resource sharing.

### 3. **Compliance and Permissions Management**
   - For websites requiring **specific compliance measures** (e.g., GDPR, SOC 2), using separate projects simplifies audit and policy enforcement. This can include using specific regions, logging, or security policies on a per-website basis.
   - If team members are working on different sites, project-based permissions mean they only have access to resources they need, enhancing security.

### 4. **Simplified Lifecycle Management**
   - Each project has an independent lifecycle, so if you need to **delete or decommission** a site, it’s straightforward to archive or delete the entire project, which removes all associated resources. This minimizes clutter and keeps your GCP environment organized.
   - Similarly, each project can be individually backed up, archived, or exported for portability or migration to other environments.

### Potential Downsides to Consider
   - **Project Limits**: GCP has a default project limit, which can be increased on request, but it’s something to keep in mind for organizations with many projects.
   - **Overhead for Small Sites**: If a website is minimal or experimental, you may consider grouping multiple such sites in a shared project until they’re more established.

### Recommendation
For most websites and applications, creating a new project per site is the best practice. This strategy promotes isolation, simplifies management, and offers strong security, scalability, and cost tracking benefits.
