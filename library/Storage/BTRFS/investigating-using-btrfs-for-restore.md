**Prompt summary:** You are asking if a Btrfs send backup on an external drive would be useful if your Fedora computer was bricked, and you had to reinstall the OS on new hardware. You want to know if you could restore from that backup.

Yes, a **Btrfs send** backup would be very useful to you, and you could indeed restore from it, but itâ€™s important to note how you would handle the restoration process. Here's how you can use it:

1. **Restoring from Btrfs send backup:**
   - A Btrfs send operation typically creates a stream of data from a Btrfs snapshot, which can then be stored on an external drive.
   - To restore that snapshot, you would use **Btrfs receive**, which takes the data stream and applies it back onto a Btrfs filesystem on the new hardware.

2. **Steps to restore:**
   - **Install a new Fedora system** on the new hardware with Btrfs as the root file system (or create a Btrfs filesystem on a new partition if you prefer).
   - Mount the Btrfs filesystem on your external drive where the **send** backup is stored.
   - Create an empty subvolume on the new Btrfs filesystem that will receive the snapshot:
     ```bash
     btrfs subvolume create /mnt/new-btrfs-root
     ```
   - Use the **Btrfs receive** command to restore the snapshot into the new subvolume:
     ```bash
     btrfs receive /mnt/new-btrfs-root < /path/to/external/drive/backup
     ```
   - After restoring, you might need to update bootloader settings, initramfs, or even adjust system configurations (especially if hardware has changed).

3. **Considerations:**
   - The backup would contain your file system data (e.g., root, home, etc.), but **it won't include bootloader or low-level system settings**. After restoration, you would still need to reinstall the bootloader (like GRUB) and configure any system-level settings that were not part of the snapshot.
   - If the restored system is on different hardware, you may need to install or adjust drivers for the new hardware.
   - The **Btrfs send/receive** process is very flexible and efficient for restoring file system data, but you should be prepared to handle any OS-specific configurations post-restoration.

This method should allow you to restore most, if not all, of your previous system state, depending on how comprehensive your snapshot was when you took the Btrfs send.
