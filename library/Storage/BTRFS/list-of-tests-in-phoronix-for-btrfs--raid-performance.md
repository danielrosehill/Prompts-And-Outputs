# Prompt

Can you give me a list of tests available through Phoronix test suite which would be revealing about how the BTRFS + RAID setup is perofrming on my computer

# Output

Hereâ€™s a list of benchmarks available through the **Phoronix Test Suite** that would provide insight into how your **BTRFS + RAID1** setup is performing on your system. These tests focus on disk I/O performance, filesystem features, and overall system capabilities.

### **Relevant Tests for BTRFS + RAID1 Performance**

#### **1. Disk I/O Performance**
- **Test Name**: `disk`
  - **Description**: This test measures the read and write performance of your disks, which is crucial for evaluating the performance of BTRFS in a RAID setup.
  
#### **2. File System Performance**
- **Test Name**: `btrfs`
  - **Description**: Specifically tests BTRFS filesystem features and performance, such as snapshotting, balancing, and overall I/O performance under various conditions.

#### **3. I/O Performance Benchmarking**
- **Test Name**: `fio`
  - **Description**: This test utilizes `fio` to benchmark random and sequential I/O operations, which helps assess how BTRFS handles different workloads.

#### **4. File Copying Performance**
- **Test Name**: `cpio`
  - **Description**: Measures the performance of file copying operations, which can be affected by BTRFS features like deduplication and compression.

#### **5. Compression Performance**
- **Test Name**: `btrfs-compression`
  - **Description**: This benchmark evaluates the read/write performance with and without compression enabled on BTRFS.

#### **6. RAID Performance**
- **Test Name**: `mdadm`
  - **Description**: Tests the performance of software RAID setups using `mdadm`, which is useful for understanding how RAID1 performance compares to non-RAID configurations.

#### **7. Overall System Benchmark**
- **Test Name**: `system`
  - **Description**: A comprehensive system benchmark that includes various tests across CPU, memory, and disk, giving a holistic view of system performance.

#### **8. Database Performance**
- **Test Name**: `sqlite`
  - **Description**: Evaluates how well your BTRFS setup performs with database operations, which can be insightful for workloads that rely on frequent read/write operations.

#### **9. Multithreaded Disk Performance**
- **Test Name**: `dd`
  - **Description**: Measures the performance of raw disk writes/reads using the `dd` command, which can help evaluate BTRFS under multithreaded conditions.

### **How to Run These Tests**
To run these tests using the Phoronix Test Suite, you can use commands like the following:

```bash
phoronix-test-suite run disk --anonymize
phoronix-test-suite run btrfs --anonymize
phoronix-test-suite run fio --anonymize
phoronix-test-suite run cpio --anonymize
phoronix-test-suite run btrfs-compression --anonymize
phoronix-test-suite run mdadm --anonymize
phoronix-test-suite run system --anonymize
phoronix-test-suite run sqlite --anonymize
phoronix-test-suite run dd --anonymize
```

### **Summary**
These tests will give you valuable insights into how your BTRFS + RAID1 setup is performing in various scenarios, focusing on disk performance, filesystem features, and system capabilities. You can run them individually or create a batch script to execute them all in one go.
