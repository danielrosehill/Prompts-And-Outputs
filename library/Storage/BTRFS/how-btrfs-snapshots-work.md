You asked how Btrfs snapshots work, and here's a brief explanation:

Btrfs snapshots are a core feature of the Btrfs filesystem, allowing you to take a "snapshot" of the state of a file system at a particular moment in time. These snapshots are created almost instantly and are efficient because they use a copy-on-write (COW) mechanism. This means that when you take a snapshot, no data is copied initially. Instead, the snapshot references the existing data blocks, and only changes made after the snapshot are stored separately. This allows for fast and space-efficient backups or rollbacks of the filesystem.

There are two main types of snapshots in Btrfs:

1. Read-only snapshots: These are immutable and can't be altered after creation. They're typically used for backups or to preserve the state of the system at a specific point in time.


2. Read-write snapshots: These can be modified like a normal subvolume. They're useful for testing or for situations where you may want to roll back to a previous state after making changes.



You can create snapshots at the subvolume level, meaning you can snapshot just a part of the filesystem rather than the entire system, offering flexibility in backup and recovery.

Snapshots are also commonly used in rollback scenarios, where you can revert to a previous state if something goes wrong, such as after a failed system update.

Let me know if you need further details or examples on how to use Btrfs snapshots!
