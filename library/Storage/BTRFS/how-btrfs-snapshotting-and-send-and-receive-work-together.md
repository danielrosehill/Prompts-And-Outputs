When you want to store a Btrfs snapshot on another system, such as an external SSD, you can use **Btrfs send/receive**. Hereâ€™s how it works:

1. **Create a Snapshot on the Local System**:
   The snapshot remains on the same filesystem and only references existing data blocks without copying them.

2. **Transfer Snapshot to External SSD**:
   Use `btrfs send` to stream the snapshot to another location, and `btrfs receive` to write it on the external SSD. This process copies the actual data, creating a complete backup that can be used to restore the system. 

By doing this, you transfer all necessary data from the snapshot without duplicating files locally.
