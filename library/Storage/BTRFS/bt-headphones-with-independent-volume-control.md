You are asking specifically for Bluetooth headphones that can control the volume directly, as the turntable itself lacks volume control. Yes, many Bluetooth headphones and earbuds come with built-in volume controls that allow you to adjust the sound independently of the connected device. This feature is often referred to as on-device volume control or independent volume control.

Here’s what this feature means:

On-device volume control allows the headphones or earbuds to adjust the sound output directly, regardless of the source device's settings.

Independent volume control means the headphones manage their own volume level separate from the connected device, allowing you to lower or raise the volume as needed.


Some headphones with this feature include:

1. Sony WH-1000XM5 or XM4 – These models have touch-sensitive controls on the ear cups for adjusting volume directly.


2. Jabra Elite 85h – Features buttons that allow independent volume control.


3. Bose QuietComfort 45 – Physical volume buttons are located on the ear cups, allowing you to control sound levels.


4. Sennheiser HD 450BT – These over-ear headphones come with volume control buttons on the side.



With these, you won't need to rely on the turntable's lack of volume adjustment.
