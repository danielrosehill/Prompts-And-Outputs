# Prompt

Great. Can you give me a command that might provide real time monitoring in a separate terminal so that I don't need to keep running that command?

# Output

Certainly! You can use the `watch` command in a separate terminal to continuously monitor the balance status in real-time. Here’s how you can do it:

```bash
watch -n 5 'sudo btrfs balance status /'
```

### Explanation:
- `watch -n 5`: Refreshes the command output every 5 seconds. You can adjust this interval by changing the number (e.g., `-n 10` for every 10 seconds).
- `'sudo btrfs balance status /'`: This is the command being run repeatedly, which will show the balance progress.

Simply open a new terminal window, enter the command above, and it will continuously display the current status of the RAID1 conversion process, updating every 5 seconds. This way, you don’t need to manually rerun the command, and you’ll get real-time updates as the process progresses.
