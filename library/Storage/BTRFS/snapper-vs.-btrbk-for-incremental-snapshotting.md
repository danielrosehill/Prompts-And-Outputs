# Prompt

You identified Snapper and BTRBK as two tools that could be used efficiently to create incremental snapshots of a BTRFS filesystem onto an external SSD also formatted as BTRFS. Can you help me decide which would be more suitable for this application (or suggest an alternate tool?)

# Output

Hereâ€™s a comparison between **Snapper** and **Btrbk** to help you decide which tool is more suitable for creating incremental snapshots of a Btrfs filesystem onto an external SSD:

| Feature                   | Snapper                                                   | Btrbk                                           |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Ease of Setup**         | Easier initial setup, integrates with OpenSUSE and Fedora | Requires configuration but flexible             |
| **Incremental Snapshots** | Supports incremental snapshots                            | Supports incremental backups via send/receive   |
| **Automation**            | Cron jobs for automation                                  | Built-in automation options                     |
| **Exclusions**            | Limited control over exclusions                           | Can exclude subvolumes, granular control        |
| **Use Case**              | Best for managing local snapshots                         | Ideal for efficient backups to external devices |

### Recommendation:
- **Use Snapper** if you want a straightforward setup for **local** snapshots.
- **Use Btrbk** if you need **more flexibility** with external backups, especially when configuring incremental transfers and exclusions.
