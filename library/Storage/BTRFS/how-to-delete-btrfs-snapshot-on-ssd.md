To delete a **Btrfs snapshot** stored on an SSD, use the following command:

1. **Identify the Snapshot Path**:
   Locate the exact path of the snapshot you want to delete. It should be something like `/mnt/your_btrfs/subvolume_name/snapshot_name`.

2. **Delete the Snapshot**:
   Run:
   ```bash
   sudo btrfs subvolume delete /mnt/your_btrfs/subvolume_name/snapshot_name
   ```
   Replace with the actual path to your snapshot.

3. **Verify Deletion**:
   List subvolumes to ensure itâ€™s deleted:
   ```bash
   sudo btrfs subvolume list /mnt/your_btrfs
   ```

These steps should remove the snapshot from your SSD.
