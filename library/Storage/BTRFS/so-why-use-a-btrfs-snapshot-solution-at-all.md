What am I missing out on then by not using a BTRFS aware backup solution?

# Output

Based on the search results and your question about what you might be missing by not using a BTRFS-aware backup solution, here are the key points:

1. BTRFS-specific features:
   BTRFS-aware backup solutions can take advantage of features like:
   - Snapshots: These are instant, space-efficient copies of subvolumes [1][2].
   - Send/receive functionality: This allows for efficient incremental backups [1][2].

2. Space efficiency:
   BTRFS snapshots initially consume very little additional disk space, making them more space-efficient than full copies [3].

3. Speed:
   BTRFS-native operations like snapshots and send/receive can be faster than traditional file-by-file backup methods [2].

4. Integrity checks:
   BTRFS includes built-in checksums for data and metadata, which can be utilized by BTRFS-aware backup tools to ensure data integrity [1][4].

5. Self-healing capabilities:
   When using redundant profiles, BTRFS can self-heal corrupted data, which can be leveraged during backups [4].

6. Subvolume awareness:
   BTRFS-aware tools can work with subvolumes, allowing for more granular backups and restores [3].

7. Compression:
   If you're using BTRFS compression, a BTRFS-aware solution can handle this natively [1].

However, for your specific one-time, full system backup before a RAID migration, a block-level backup tool like Clonezilla is still a valid and comprehensive option. It will create a complete image of your system, including all BTRFS structures and data.

The main trade-off is that while you get a complete, bootable backup with Clonezilla, you miss out on the potential space and time savings that incremental, BTRFS-aware backups could offer in a long-term backup strategy. For your immediate needs though, Clonezilla remains a solid choice for creating a full system backup before a major operation like RAID migration.
