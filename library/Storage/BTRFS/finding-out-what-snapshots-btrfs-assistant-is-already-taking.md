### Explanation of Existing Btrfs Subvolumes and Snapshots:

From your `btrfs subvolume list /` output, it appears you have the following key subvolumes and snapshots:

- **Persistent Subvolumes:**
  - `ID 256`: `/home` — Your home directory.
  - `ID 260`: `/root` — The main root filesystem.
  - `ID 258`: `/.snapshots` — Contains all root snapshots.

- **Snapshots (within `/.snapshots` and `/home/.snapshots`):**
  - Various IDs under `.snapshots` paths, such as:
    - `.snapshots/root_2024-10-22_18-41-11` (root-level snapshots)
    - `home/.snapshots/home_2024-10-22_18-41-48` (home directory snapshots)

### Backup Strategy to External SSD:

1. **Mount the External SSD:**
   ```bash
   sudo mount /dev/sdX1 /mnt/desktop-backups
   ```

2. **Transfer Existing Snapshots Using `btrfs send/receive`:**
   To copy a snapshot, run:
   ```bash
   sudo btrfs send /.snapshots/root_2024-10-22_18-41-11 | sudo btrfs receive /mnt/desktop-backups/
   ```

3. **Incremental Backups:**
   For future backups, use:
   ```bash
   sudo btrfs send -p /.snapshots/root_2024-10-22_18-41-11 /.snapshots/root_2024-10-22_18-54-23 | sudo btrfs receive /mnt/desktop-backups/
   ```

This approach ensures efficient use of Btrfs's native snapshot capabilities, preserving your system's state on the external SSD.
