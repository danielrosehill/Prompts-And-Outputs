Based on the information provided, here's a summary of the basic specifications for your current WD Elements drive:

## Current Drive Specifications

- **Model**: WD Elements 25A2
- **Capacity**: 1 TB (1,000,170,586,112 bytes)
- **Interface**: USB (specific version not mentioned)
- **Rotation Speed**: 5400 rpm
- **Logical Block Size**: 512 bytes
- **Physical Block Size**: 4096 bytes

This drive is indeed outdated, as it lacks SMART capability and has a relatively slow rotation speed.

## Suggested Modern Replacements

For a modern replacement optimized for BTRFS and with either 1TB or 2TB capacity, I recommend considering the following options:

1. **WD My Passport SSD (2TB)**
   - Type: Portable SSD
   - Capacity: 2TB
   - Interface: USB 3.2 Gen-2 (up to 10Gbps)
   - Read Speed: Up to 1050 MB/s
   - Write Speed: Up to 1000 MB/s
   - Estimated Cost: $179.99[5]

2. **SanDisk Extreme Portable SSD V2 (1TB)**
   - Type: Portable SSD
   - Capacity: 1TB
   - Interface: USB 3.2 Gen 2x2
   - Read Speed: Up to 1050 MB/s
   - Write Speed: Up to 1000 MB/s
   - Estimated Cost: $129.99

Both of these options are significantly faster than your current HDD and would work well with BTRFS. They offer better durability, faster transfer speeds, and are more compact. The SSD technology makes them ideal for frequent read/write operations typical in backup scenarios.

If you prefer to stick with an HDD for higher capacity at a lower cost:

3. **WD Elements Portable HDD (2TB)**
   - Type: Portable HDD
   - Capacity: 2TB
   - Interface: USB 3.0
   - Rotation Speed: 5400 rpm (likely)
   - Estimated Cost: $64.99[1]

This option is more similar to your current drive but with double the capacity. It's not as fast as the SSD options but offers more storage per dollar.

For optimal performance with BTRFS, especially for system backups, I recommend going with one of the SSD options. They will provide much faster read/write speeds, which is beneficial for both creating and restoring backups.

# Prompt

Well, this is operating system data that we're going to be putting onto cold storage. So I'd be more worried about data longevity than read/write performance. Can you think of any options that might be particularly suitable for this use case?

# Output

Based on your preference for a small plug-in form factor and considering your need for cold storage of operating system data with a focus on longevity, here are a few suitable options:

1. **WD My Passport (2TB or 4TB)**
   - Type: Portable HDD
   - Capacity: 2TB or 4TB options
   - Interface: USB 3.2 Gen 1 (USB 3.0)
   - Features:
     - Password protection and 256-bit AES hardware encryption
     - Automatic backup software
     - Slim and durable design
   - Estimated Cost: $60-$100 (2TB), $100-$120 (4TB)

2. **Seagate Backup Plus Slim (2TB or 4TB)**
   - Type: Portable HDD
   - Capacity: 2TB or 4TB options
   - Interface: USB 3.0
   - Features:
     - Mylio Create plan and Adobe Creative Cloud Photography plan
     - Seagate Toolkit backup software
   - Estimated Cost: $60-$80 (2TB), $100-$120 (4TB)

3. **Toshiba Canvio Basics (2TB or 4TB)**
   - Type: Portable HDD
   - Capacity: 2TB or 4TB options
   - Interface: USB 3.0
   - Features:
     - Simple plug-and-play operation
     - No software required
   - Estimated Cost: $55-$75 (2TB), $90-$110 (4TB)

These options all provide the small, plug-in form factor you prefer while offering suitable capacity for storing operating system backups. They're also more cost-effective than SSDs for cold storage purposes.

For your use case of cold storage:

1. Choose a higher capacity (4TB) if budget allows, to accommodate multiple backups or versions.
2. Consider rotating between two drives for added redundancy.
3. Store the drive in a cool, dry place when not in use to maximize longevity.
4. Periodically (every 6-12 months) connect and spin up the drive to ensure its health.
5. Use the built-in encryption features to secure your data.

Remember, while these drives are reliable for cold storage, it's always a good practice to have multiple backup copies of critical data, possibly using different storage technologies or locations for added security.
