Yes, you can create a system for automatically mounting your SSD to the same mount point whenever it's connected by using `udev` rules or adding an entry to `/etc/fstab`. 

### Using `/etc/fstab`:
1. **Identify the SSD**: Find the UUID of the SSD:
   ```bash
   sudo blkid
   ```

2. **Edit `/etc/fstab`**:
   Open the file in a text editor:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/fstab
   ```

3. **Add an Entry**:
   Add the following line, replacing `UUID=<your-uuid>` with the actual UUID:
   ```plaintext
   UUID=<your-uuid> /mnt/desktop-backups btrfs defaults,nofail 0 0
   ```

This setup will ensure that the SSD automatically mounts to `/mnt/desktop-backups` whenever it is connected.
