There are several examples of datasets that were released under restrictive terms but later had non-official derivative versions created by the open-source community, sometimes with the original organization's consent:

1. **Getty Provenance Index**: The J. Paul Getty Trust released parts of its **Provenance Index®** datasets under a more restrictive license before completing their full Linked Open Data (LOD) release. During this period, the open-source community worked with these CSV exports, creating derivative datasets while adhering to Getty’s guidelines for attribution and use. Getty encouraged sharing derivative datasets under similarly permissive licenses【111†source】.

2. **Open Government Data Initiatives**: Many governments initially release datasets under **restrictive licenses** that limit commercial use or derivative works. For example, the **Open Knowledge Foundation** launched the **Global Open Data Index** to track how government datasets are being made available, often working with partial or less open datasets. Over time, governments improved their open data policies based on community feedback and advocacy【110†source】.

3. **AI and Open Datasets**: In the field of AI, datasets such as those from **Stability AI** or **Google Open Images** are sometimes released with restrictive licenses. However, the open-source community often creates non-official derivatives that adhere to the restrictions but improve accessibility or usability for broader audiences【112†source】【113†source】.

In each of these cases, while the original datasets had usage limitations, the open-source community found ways to legally build upon them, often by creating **tools for easier access** or providing **non-commercial applications**. Working with restrictive datasets usually requires close adherence to attribution, non-commercial use, and share-alike principles where applicable. This approach can help avoid conflicts with the original licensing terms while still fostering innovation.
