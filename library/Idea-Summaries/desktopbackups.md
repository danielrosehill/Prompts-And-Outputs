# Notes

This generation follows the model of a prompting strategy I love employing!

You could call it something like:

*Here's what I believe in, how do you define me?*

I've used it to discover that - apparently - I'm a "digital sovereignty advocate." While labelling can be harmful, there are benefits to using LLMs to identify if your thoughts fit into a cohesive or existing ideology.

By discovering that some of my very firmly held beliefs about backup made me a "digital sovereignty" fan, I was able to discover and follow some thinkers and organisations in this space who would otherwise have evaded my attention.

## Prompt

Please help me to develop a document outlining my thoughts on a philosophy that I'm developing: backing up desktop computers can be difficult, especially on Linux workstations. Nobody likes reinstalling their whole system and setting everything up again. But things like drive failures will remain possibilities, laptops can be lost or stolen, etc. Increasingly, cloud computing is making desktops less important. Or rather, all that's required for desktops to do is provide a web browser and a keyboard. The backup strategies of tomorrow won't focus on protecting local data because less and less of it will be stored locally. They'll focus instead of preserving minimalistic imprints of local operating system configurations - things like keyboard macros and themes and browser preferences.

### Philosophy of Future Backup Strategies for Linux Workstations

**Introduction: The Challenge of Backups on Linux Workstations**

Backing up desktop computers, especially Linux workstations, can be a complex and daunting task. Users face challenges such as hardware failures, data corruption, or even theft and loss of devices. Traditionally, backup strategies have focused on protecting both system files and user data, but this approach is becoming increasingly outdated as the role of desktop systems evolves. With the rise of cloud computing and the shift towards web-based applications, the need to store large amounts of data locally is diminishing. This shift calls for a new philosophy in backup strategies—one that focuses on preserving minimalistic imprints of local configurations rather than full system backups.

**The Problem with Traditional Backup Approaches**

Traditional backup methods—whether full, incremental, or differential—are designed to safeguard entire systems or large volumes of data stored locally. These methods often require substantial storage space, bandwidth, and time to execute properly. For Linux users in particular, the diversity of distributions (e.g., Debian, Arch, Red Hat) and their unique configurations can make it difficult to find a one-size-fits-all solution\[1]. Moreover, traditional backups are prone to failures due to damaged media, corrupted files, or incomplete backups\[5]. As a result, many users find themselves constantly managing backup schedules and testing recovery processes to ensure reliability.

**The Shift Towards Cloud Computing and Minimal Local Data**

As cloud computing continues to grow in popularity, the need for local storage is decreasing. Many applications now run entirely in the cloud, with users accessing them through web browsers. This shift reduces the importance of preserving large amounts of local data. Instead, users need their desktops to act as gateways to cloud services—essentially just providing a browser and a keyboard\[4]. In this context, traditional backup strategies become less relevant.

**A New Focus: Preserving Local Configurations**

Given this shift away from local data storage, future backup strategies should focus on preserving minimalistic imprints of local operating system configurations rather than full backups. These imprints include:

- **Keyboard macros**
- **Themes**
- **Browser preferences**
- **Custom scripts**
- **Network settings**

These configurations are often unique to individual users and represent the personalization that makes their work environment efficient and comfortable. Losing these settings can be just as disruptive as losing data because they take time to recreate.

**The Role of Cloud-Based Solutions**

Cloud-based backup solutions are already proving effective at handling user data securely and reliably\[4]. Services like Backblaze or Dropbox allow users to store their critical files off-site with features like encryption and versioning. However, these services are not yet optimized for backing up system configurations or personal settings. Future solutions should integrate cloud storage with tools that can capture and restore these minimalistic imprints quickly and efficiently.

**The Future: Lightweight System Snapshots**

One promising approach is using lightweight system snapshots that capture only essential configuration files rather than entire systems. Tools like **Timeshift**, which takes snapshots of the system state at intervals\[2], could be adapted to focus more on configuration files rather than full system images. This would allow users to restore their personalized settings quickly without needing to reinstall everything from scratch.

**Conclusion: A Minimalist Approach for Tomorrow's Desktops**

In conclusion, as desktops become less central to computing workflows due to the rise of cloud-based applications, backup strategies must evolve accordingly. The future will likely see a shift away from traditional full-system backups toward minimalist approaches that focus on preserving key configurations and personalization settings. By focusing on these imprints rather than large volumes of data, users can ensure that their work environments remain consistent even when hardware fails or devices are lost.

This philosophy aligns with modern computing trends while addressing the practical challenges faced by Linux users today.
