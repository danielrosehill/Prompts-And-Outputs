# Prompt

Let's say that I wanted to use my Home server as a backup target for my fedora desktop. They're on the LAN so I hope it would be fairly quick. 
I have an Ubuntu VM on the machine and a Fedora VM. I would rather not run both to conserve resources. But I'd run the Fedora VM if it would really help. 
What's the easiest way for me to run a really good incremental backup from my desktop to the home server? The idea would be capturing the system config files and package installations. Ideally it would be a good enough backup that the system could be restored from it on new hardware with minimal disruption

# Output

Based on your requirements, here are some recommendations for backing up your Fedora desktop to your home server:

## Borg Backup

Borg is an excellent option for incremental backups that would meet your needs:

- It provides deduplication and compression for efficient backups
- Supports incremental backups
- Can backup system files and configurations
- Allows restoring to different hardware
- Works well over a LAN connection

To set it up:

1. Install Borg on your Fedora desktop and Ubuntu VM:

```bash
# On Fedora
sudo dnf install borgbackup

# On Ubuntu 
sudo apt install borgbackup
```

2. Initialize a Borg repository on your Ubuntu VM:

```bash
borg init --encryption=repokey /path/to/backup/location
```

3. Create a backup script on your Fedora desktop:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
borg create --stats --progress \
  user@ubuntu-vm:/path/to/backup/location::'{hostname}-{now}' \
  /etc /var /usr /root /home \
  --exclude '/home/*/.cache' \
  --exclude '/var/cache' \
  --exclude '/var/tmp'
```

4. Run this script regularly via cron or systemd timer[1].

## Rsnapshot 

Rsnapshot is another good option that uses rsync for efficient incremental backups:

1. Install rsnapshot on your Ubuntu VM:

```bash
sudo apt install rsnapshot
```

2. Configure /etc/rsnapshot.conf on the Ubuntu VM to specify backup locations and intervals

3. Set up SSH key-based authentication from the Ubuntu VM to your Fedora desktop

4. Run rsnapshot via cron on the Ubuntu VM to pull backups from your Fedora system[2]

Both options allow you to run the backup server on your Ubuntu VM while backing up the Fedora desktop. Borg tends to be more efficient for larger backups, while rsnapshot is simpler to set up initially.

For either solution, you can restore your system by booting from a live USB, formatting the new drive, and restoring the backup. You may need to reinstall the bootloader afterward.

# Prompt 2

Based on your requirements, there isn't a major need to use the Fedora VM specifically for backups. The Ubuntu VM should be sufficient. However, there are some BTRFS-native approaches that could be beneficial for your use case:

## BTRFS Snapshots and Send/Receive

BTRFS offers built-in snapshot and send/receive functionality that can be very effective for incremental backups:

1. Create read-only snapshots on your Fedora desktop:

```bash
sudo btrfs subvolume snapshot -r / /mnt/backup/root_snapshot
```

2. Send the initial snapshot to your home server:

```bash
sudo btrfs send /mnt/backup/root_snapshot | ssh user@homeserver 'btrfs receive /path/to/backups'
```

3. For subsequent backups, create new snapshots and send only the differences:

```bash
sudo btrfs send -p /mnt/backup/previous_snapshot /mnt/backup/new_snapshot | ssh user@homeserver 'btrfs receive /path/to/backups'
```

This approach offers several advantages:

- Efficient incremental backups
- Captures system configuration and package installations
- Allows for easy system restoration
- Works well over LAN connections[1][4]

## Butterfly Backup

Butterfly Backup is another good option that wraps rsync for incremental backups:

1. Install Butterfly Backup on your Fedora desktop:

```bash
sudo pip3 install butterfly-backup
```

2. Set up a backup job:

```bash
butterfly-backup --mode Incremental --source / --destination user@homeserver:/path/to/backups
```

Butterfly Backup offers:

- Multiple backup modes (Full, Incremental, Differential)
- A catalog for easy restoration
- Support for bulk backups of multiple machines[6]

Both BTRFS native snapshots and Butterfly Backup would meet your needs for capturing system configurations and package installations, while allowing for efficient incremental backups over your LAN. The BTRFS approach might be slightly more efficient if you're already using BTRFS on your Fedora desktop, while Butterfly Backup offers more flexibility and easier management of multiple backup sets.

# Input

You've lost me here. These are things that would only be possible sending the backup to a Fedora server or they'd work sending it to the Ubuntu VM too? 

Could you give me a run through of my best options for this job giving me the pros and cons of each. I'd like whatever is going to be the quickest to run

# Output

I apologize for the confusion. Let me clarify and provide a rundown of your best options for backing up your Fedora desktop to your home server with an Ubuntu VM, focusing on speed and efficiency.

## Best Options for Your Backup Job

1. Borg Backup

**Pros:**
- Works well with Ubuntu VM as the backup target
- Efficient deduplication and compression
- Fast incremental backups
- Supports encryption
- Can capture system configurations and package installations

**Cons:**
- Requires installation on both Fedora desktop and Ubuntu VM
- Slightly more complex initial setup

2. BTRFS Send/Receive

**Pros:**
- Native to BTRFS, very efficient if you're already using BTRFS
- Fast incremental backups
- Captures entire system state, including configurations and packages

**Cons:**
- Requires BTRFS on both source and destination
- May need additional setup on the Ubuntu VM to support BTRFS

3. Rsnapshot

**Pros:**
- Works well with Ubuntu VM as the backup target
- Simple to set up and use
- Efficient for incremental backups
- Can capture system configurations and package installations

**Cons:**
- Less efficient than Borg for large backups
- No built-in encryption

4. Butterfly Backup

**Pros:**
- Works with Ubuntu VM as the backup target
- Offers multiple backup modes (Full, Incremental, Differential)
- Provides a catalog for easy restoration
- Supports bulk backups of multiple machines

**Cons:**
- Less established than other options
- May be overkill for a single machine backup

## Recommendation

Considering your requirement for the quickest solution and the ability to back up to an Ubuntu VM, I would recommend **Borg Backup** as the best option:

1. It's highly efficient and fast for incremental backups.
2. It works well over LAN connections.
3. It can easily backup to your Ubuntu VM.
4. It provides excellent compression and deduplication, saving space.
5. It supports encryption for added security.

To set it up:

1. Install Borg on both your Fedora desktop and Ubuntu VM.
2. Initialize a Borg repository on your Ubuntu VM.
3. Create a backup script on your Fedora desktop to run the backups.
4. Schedule the script to run regularly using cron or systemd timer.

This solution doesn't require running the Fedora VM, conserving resources as you requested. It will provide fast, efficient backups that capture your system configuration and package installations, allowing for easy restoration if needed[2].
# Clarify Other Options

The other ones sounded very interesting though!
Are there ones that I can only do from Fedora to Fedora?
