To summarize: you're asking if there is a **GUI for Amanda** and whether it can be used to perform a **block-level backup** from your **Fedora** computer to a **Synology NAS** on your LAN.

### 1. **GUI for Amanda**:
   - **Zmanda** is a commercial variant of Amanda with a **web-based GUI**. It provides a more user-friendly interface for managing backups and restores using Amanda. Zmanda is especially useful for those who want to avoid the complexity of managing Amanda through the command line.
   - **Zmanda features**:
     - Web-based GUI for managing backups and restores.
     - Supports full and incremental backups.
     - Centralized management of multiple systems.

   However, the full-featured **Zmanda** version is a paid product, although it can simplify the management of Amanda significantly.

   **Open-source Amanda** does not have a native GUI, but it can still be used for command-line-based operations.

### 2. **Block-level Backups with Amanda**:
   - **Amanda** does support block-level backups, especially using **raw device backup** modes. This enables Amanda to back up the entire partition or disk, allowing you to capture not just file changes but entire system images, which can be useful for a full system restore.
   - **Raw device backup** allows Amanda to back up an entire disk or partition, much like how tools like **Clonezilla** work, but with the flexibility of Amanda's scheduling and network capabilities.

### 3. **Using Amanda for Block-level Backups to a Synology NAS**:
   - **Yes**, you can use Amanda to back up your Fedora system to your **Synology NAS** over the LAN. Here’s how you would approach it:
   
   #### Steps to Set Up Amanda for Block-level Backups:
   1. **Install Amanda on Fedora**:
      ```bash
      sudo dnf install amanda amanda-server amanda-client
      ```

   2. **Configure Synology NAS as Backup Destination**:
      - On your **Synology NAS**, enable **NFS** or **SMB** (depending on which protocol you prefer).
      - Create a share folder on your NAS for the backups.
      - Mount the NAS on your Fedora system:
        ```bash
        sudo mkdir -p /mnt/nas
        sudo mount -t nfs NAS_IP:/volume1/backup /mnt/nas  # If using NFS
        ```

   3. **Set Up Amanda for Block-level Backups**:
      - Amanda can be configured to back up an entire partition or block device using its **raw disk** mode. This is configured within Amanda's `disklist` file.
      - Example `disklist` entry for a raw block device:
        ```
        fedora-hostname /dev/sda amraw
        ```
      - This entry tells Amanda to perform a block-level backup of the entire `/dev/sda` disk.

   4. **Schedule Backups to the NAS**:
      - Ensure Amanda is configured to back up to the mounted NAS directory `/mnt/nas`, where the NAS will store the backup images.

   5. **Automate Backups**:
      - Use Amanda’s scheduling features to run automatic block-level backups at regular intervals, storing the backup images on the Synology NAS.

### Summary:
- **Amanda** can perform **block-level backups** using its **raw disk mode** and can store these backups on a **Synology NAS** over your LAN.
- **Zmanda** offers a GUI for Amanda, but it is a commercial product. The open-source Amanda does not have a native GUI, so it will require command-line configuration.
  
For a full-system, block-level backup setup, Amanda provides a robust solution, especially with the flexibility of backing up over the network to your NAS.
