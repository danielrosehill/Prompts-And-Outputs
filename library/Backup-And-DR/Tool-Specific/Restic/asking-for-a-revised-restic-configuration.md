Got it, let's make sure your **Restic backup** captures the essential parts of your Fedora workstation for future restoration onto new hardware, **without any RAID-specific configurations** that could tie the backup to your current RAID setup. Below, I'll provide a revised approach for **inclusion** and **exclusion** rules to help ensure your backup is flexible enough to restore onto different hardware configurations without RAID dependencies.

### Key Goals
- **Hardware-agnostic Backup**: The backup should be easily restorable on new hardware, even if the new hardware setup is significantly different from the original (e.g., no RAID).
- **Full System Backup**: We want to capture as much of the system state as possible while excluding files that might make restoration problematic, especially in a non-RAID context.

### Suggested Inclusion Paths
To ensure you have a comprehensive backup that can be restored onto new hardware, make sure to **include** the following directories:

1. **System Configuration**:
   - `/etc`: This contains configuration files for most system services and installed software. It’s important for restoring configurations but avoid RAID-specific entries (like `/etc/mdadm.conf`).
   
2. **User Data**:
   - `/home`: User files and personal configuration settings. This is crucial for restoring user environments.
   - `/root`: Root user’s home directory. Useful if any important configurations or data are stored here.

3. **Logs and Application Data**:
   - `/var`: Logs and application data. However, exclude unnecessary subdirectories like `/var/tmp` and `/var/cache` to save space. Logs can be helpful for troubleshooting after restoration, but not all logs are needed.

4. **Custom Software**:
   - `/usr/local`: Location for manually installed software.
   - `/opt`: Typically used for optional and manually installed applications, including **AppImages**.

5. **Application Data**:
   - `/var/lib/flatpak`: Flatpak applications.
   - `/var/lib/snapd`: Snap applications.
   - `/usr/share/applications` and `/usr/share/icons`: These hold desktop entry files and icons used by applications, important for ensuring the visual desktop environment is restored correctly.

6. **Python and Other Package Environments**:
   - User-level Python packages: Include packages installed via pip that are local to your user. If Python indicates the base as `/home/daniel/local`, include:
     ```bash
     /home/daniel/local/lib/python3.*/site-packages
     ```

### Suggested Exclusion Paths
To make sure the backup is **hardware-agnostic**, exclude **RAID-specific** and **dynamic system** paths that will not be needed in a new hardware environment:

1. **Dynamic and Hardware-Specific Paths**:
   - `/dev`, `/proc`, `/sys`: These directories contain dynamically generated information about hardware and system processes.
   - `/run`: Runtime data that’s generated anew at every boot.
   - `/tmp`: Temporary files that are not useful after a reboot.
   - `/mnt` and `/media`: Mounted drives, which could include your backup target and lead to recursive backups.

2. **Cache and Temporary Data**:
   - `/var/tmp`, `/var/cache`: Temporary and cache data generated by applications.
   - `/home/*/.cache`: User cache data that can easily be regenerated.

3. **RAID-Specific Configurations**:
   - `/etc/mdadm.conf`: This file contains RAID metadata for software RAID configurations. Exclude it since it is specific to your current RAID setup. Including it might cause issues if restoring onto hardware that doesn't use RAID.

4. **Lost+Found and Filesystem Artifacts**:
   - `/lost+found`: This is created by the filesystem to store recovered corrupted files. It’s not useful for a backup.

### Revised Restic Command
Here's how you could implement the **inclusions** and **exclusions** using **Restic**:

```bash
restic backup / \
    --repo /mnt/desktop-backup/restic-repo \
    --exclude=/dev \
    --exclude=/proc \
    --exclude=/sys \
    --exclude=/tmp \
    --exclude=/run \
    --exclude=/mnt \
    --exclude=/media \
    --exclude=/lost+found \
    --exclude=/var/tmp \
    --exclude=/var/cache \
    --exclude=/home/*/.cache \
    --exclude=/etc/mdadm.conf \
    --include=/etc \
    --include=/home \
    --include=/root \
    --include=/usr/local \
    --include=/opt \
    --include=/var/lib/flatpak \
    --include=/var/lib/snapd \
    --include=/usr/share/applications \
    --include=/usr/share/icons \
    --include=/home/daniel/local/lib/python3.*/site-packages
```

### Explanation
- **Include Paths** (`--include`): The include paths are meant to specifically capture the necessary directories that you will need for restoring your system and data.
- **Exclude Paths** (`--exclude`): The exclude paths are meant to remove directories that are hardware-specific, dynamic, or otherwise unnecessary for system restoration.
- **Backup `/` as Root**: The command uses `/` as the target for backup, but paths are filtered by include and exclude rules to ensure only relevant data is backed up.

### Additional Considerations
1. **RAID Metadata**:
   - Excluding `/etc/mdadm.conf` and any RAID-related configuration files ensures that the new system will not attempt to reference the RAID setup during restoration.

2. **Automating Backups**:
   - You can automate the Restic backup using a **cron job** to run periodically.
   - Add a cron job by editing the crontab file:
     ```bash
     crontab -e
     ```
     Then, add a line like:
     ```bash
     0 2 * * * /path/to/restic-backup.sh
     ```
     This would run the backup script daily at 2 AM.

3. **Password Management**:
   - The Restic repository password can be specified using the `RESTIC_PASSWORD` environment variable to make automated backups possible:
     ```bash
     export RESTIC_PASSWORD="YourPasswordHere"
     restic backup / --repo /mnt/desktop-backup/restic-repo ...
     ```

### Summary
- **Include** directories that are important for restoring your system, such as `/etc`, `/home`, `/usr/local`, and application data.
- **Exclude** dynamic, hardware-specific paths like `/dev`, `/proc`, `/sys`, RAID metadata (`/etc/mdadm.conf`), and other unnecessary data (e.g., caches).
- Use Restic’s `--include` and `--exclude` options to carefully specify which data is backed up.
- The goal is to create a **hardware-agnostic** backup that is flexible enough to be restored onto new hardware without RAID dependencies.

By following these steps, you will create a thorough yet flexible backup of your system, allowing for smoother restoration onto different hardware in the future. Let me know if you need any more guidance on configuring or running the backup!
