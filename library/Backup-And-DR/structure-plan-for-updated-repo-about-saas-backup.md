# Prompt

I'm creating a documentation repository outlining some of the current approaches that SaaS providers take to allowing users to back up their data. I'd like to analyse major consumer and enterprise SaaS tools to evaluate the extent to which they allow consumers to backup their data. I would like to highlight commonalities and shortcomings. I'd like to suggest a basic minimum standard that I think most providers should be required to meet and propose a systematic framework for evaluating the extent to which providers comply with this. I'd also like to create the basis for a database. Perhaps the data to populate something like an advocacy website can even be stored in the repo - so that it functions as a backend of sorts (maybe holding data in JSON for example). Please suggest how I might structure this repo

# Output

It sounds like you're planning a comprehensive and impactful project that will serve as both a resource and a repository for advocacy purposes. Here's a suggestion for structuring your repository to meet your goals, making it informative, systematic, and adaptable for potential integration into an advocacy website or other services.

### Explanation of Each Component

#### 1. **README.md**
   - A well-detailed introduction to the repository. This file will outline the purpose, goals, and structure of the repository.
   - Describe the problem: the need for backing up SaaS data, current gaps in the market, and what the repository aims to achieve.
   - Provide an overview of how data is organized, the evaluation methodology, and a summary of findings.

#### 2. **docs/** (Documentation)
   - **methodology/**: 
     - `backup_evaluation_criteria.md`: A document outlining the different criteria used to assess SaaS providers (e.g., type of data available for backup, ease of exporting, format, etc.).
     - `scoring_framework.md`: Defines the scoring system used to rank providers (e.g., a rating out of 10 based on backup capabilities).
     - `standards_minimum_expectation.md`: Proposes the minimum standard that all SaaS providers should meet in terms of data backup, such as the ability to export data in a common, structured format and maintain a backup history.
   
   - **tools_reviewed/**:
     - Individual `.md` files for each SaaS provider under review. Each file should summarize the tool’s backup capabilities, shortcomings, and how it performs against your evaluation criteria. Examples include `google_drive.md`, `dropbox.md`, etc.
   
   - **findings/**:
     - `commonalities_and_shortcomings.md`: Discuss common trends, issues, and gaps across all SaaS providers reviewed.
     - `recommendations.md`: Suggestions on how SaaS providers can improve and align with the proposed minimum standard.

#### 3. **data/** (Data for Advocacy and Analysis)
   - **providers/**:
     - Individual JSON files for each provider (`google_drive.json`, `dropbox.json`, etc.). Each file should contain structured information on how the SaaS handles data backup. This could include:
       - `backup_availability`: true/false
       - `export_formats`: list of supported formats (e.g., JSON, CSV, XML)
       - `user_initiated_backup`: true/false
       - `api_availability`: true/false
       - `ease_of_backup`: rating (1-10)
       - `backup_history`: true/false (indicating if historical versions of data can be backed up)
   
   - `summary_data.json`: Aggregates key metrics across all providers (useful for generating insights such as percentages of compliant providers, common deficiencies, etc.).

#### 4. **scripts/** (Scripts for Data Collection, Analysis, and Update)
   - **data_analysis.py**: Python script for performing analysis on the JSON data. This script could generate reports highlighting shortcomings, commonalities, and trends, which could then be exported as static HTML or Markdown for further use.
   - **update_database.py**: Script to automate the update process for provider data. If new capabilities are added or policies change, this script could be used to update the respective JSON files.

#### 5. **database/** (Structured Data Backend)
   - `providers.json`: Aggregated JSON with a detailed overview of all providers in a single file, to act as a backend for potential integration into a website.
   - `backup_capabilities_schema.json`: JSON schema defining the structure for provider data to ensure consistency in how different SaaS providers are evaluated and documented.

#### 6. **web/** (Website for Advocacy)
   - **templates/**: Placeholder folder for potential HTML templates if you decide to turn this into a web advocacy platform.
   - **static/**: Any static assets like CSS or JavaScript files for the website.

#### 7. **requirements.txt**
   - Lists all Python dependencies (e.g., for `data_analysis.py`, `update_database.py`) that are required to work with the repository. This file ensures easy setup.

#### 8. **LICENSE**
   - A license file to define how your work can be used by others. Given the advocacy nature, you may want to use an open-source license, such as MIT or Creative Commons, to encourage public use and collaboration.

### Suggested Workflow

1. **Define Evaluation Criteria**: Use `docs/methodology/backup_evaluation_criteria.md` to clearly establish what is important for a SaaS backup (e.g., frequency, ease, format).

2. **Document Each Provider**: Create individual Markdown and JSON files for each SaaS provider under `docs/tools_reviewed/` and `data/providers/`, respectively.

3. **Analyze Data**: Use `scripts/data_analysis.py` to generate insights into trends, common gaps, and areas for improvement.

4. **Build a Web Interface**: If your goal is advocacy, consider adding a simple website (`web/`) to make this information accessible to the public. You can display the findings using the JSON files as your backend.

5. **Track Changes**: Regularly update the provider data in `data/providers/` when new features or changes occur.

### Future Steps

- **Integration with an Advocacy Website**: The JSON data can be easily integrated with a web frontend to create a public advocacy site. You could use Flask or Django to serve the data as an API and populate HTML pages.
- **Community Contributions**: Allow users to contribute to the database by proposing updates to JSON files or even submitting new providers for review.
- **Automated Updates**: Consider adding a script that periodically checks for updates in SaaS provider documentation (via APIs or web scraping) and flags relevant updates for your repository.

This structure should help you systematically gather, evaluate, and advocate for better backup capabilities across SaaS providers. Do any of these ideas resonate with you, or would you like to explore a particular part of this structure in greater detail?
