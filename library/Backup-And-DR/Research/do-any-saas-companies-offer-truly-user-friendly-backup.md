# Prompt

Great work. Would you agree with my contention that 99% of SaaS companies fail to offer this level of backup to users? And can you suggest some examples of companies that DO allow users to take full backups?

# Output

Thank you! I would agree with your contention—**most SaaS companies do not offer backup solutions that meet the level of user control and completeness you outlined**. While the expectation of giving users full, automated, and incremental access to their data in a usable format should be a standard practice, the reality is that very few SaaS providers prioritize such comprehensive backup capabilities.

Here are a few reasons why **99% of SaaS companies fail to meet this level of backup**:
1. **Focus on User Convenience Over Data Control**: Many SaaS platforms focus on providing easy access and usability without emphasizing data portability or control. This leads to backup options that are often ad hoc or highly manual.
2. **Vendor Lock-in**: Some companies deliberately avoid offering comprehensive backups to create dependency on their platform, making it harder for users to migrate to other services.
3. **Complexity and Cost**: Implementing robust backup solutions, such as programmatic access and automated incremental backups, can be resource-intensive, leading many providers to favor easier solutions with fewer technical complexities.

### **Examples of Companies That Do Offer Full Backups**
While it’s rare, a few SaaS companies stand out for providing comprehensive backup options that empower users:

1. **Notion**
   - Notion provides users with the ability to export **all their data in Markdown, CSV, or HTML** formats, which includes pages, tables, and databases.
   - The export feature can be used programmatically through **integrations or third-party tools**, allowing users to back up their workspace regularly.
   - There are tools like **Notion-backup** that allow automatic and incremental backups via APIs, enhancing control.

2. **Airtable**
   - **Airtable** provides export capabilities for its databases, allowing users to export data in **CSV format**, making it possible to back up table content.
   - They also offer **API access**, which allows users to programmatically extract their data, effectively enabling automated backups via custom scripts or third-party automation tools like Zapier.

3. **Standard Notes**
   - **Standard Notes** allows users to export their notes in a fully **encrypted format** or as Markdown.
   - It provides **automatic backup options** to third-party cloud services like Dropbox, Google Drive, or via local storage.
   - Users can use **programmatic options** for incremental backups using integrations with third-party automation tools.

4. **Confluence (Atlassian)**
   - **Confluence** provides the ability for administrators to perform **full site backups**, exporting the entire wiki, including all spaces and pages.
   - It offers options to set **automated backup schedules**, although programmatic access for backup requires advanced configurations, often available through their API.

5. **Ghost (Open-Source Blogging Platform)**
   - Ghost provides a **content export feature** that includes all posts, tags, and metadata.
   - Users can set up **automated backups** through scripts or even third-party services, given that it’s open source and can be self-hosted.
   - Ghost’s use of **JSON** for exports ensures that users can restore their content effectively, but this is more useful for tech-savvy users comfortable with scripting.

6. **WordPress (Self-Hosted)**
   - While not strictly a SaaS, self-hosted **WordPress** allows complete control of data backups using plugins like **UpdraftPlus** or **All-in-One WP Migration**.
   - These plugins allow **automatic backups, incremental options**, and full control over storage locations, making it a good example of comprehensive data control.

### **The Typical SaaS Shortcomings**
Most SaaS offerings fall short by providing backup mechanisms that:
- Are **manual** in nature (users have to remember to initiate them).
- Lack **full data fidelity**, especially for non-text content like attachments and media.
- Are often provided in formats that aren’t user-friendly or comprehensive enough, or may require significant technical skills to convert into usable data.

These shortcomings mean users might lose **metadata**, **relationships** between different entities, or even **media files** like images and attachments—creating incomplete backups that make it difficult to migrate away from the platform or restore in case of data loss.

### **Conclusion**
Few SaaS providers today fully meet the high standards for backup support that are genuinely user-centered. Those that do often emphasize **data privacy**, **open-source principles**, or target tech-savvy audiences who demand greater control. The broader market still has considerable progress to make to ensure users can always access, back up, and maintain control over their data effectively and independently. 

If you're specifically evaluating SaaS tools and their backup features, it might be helpful to prioritize solutions that align with the features listed in your outline and support **third-party integration** for data automation. Let me know if you need help assessing specific tools!
