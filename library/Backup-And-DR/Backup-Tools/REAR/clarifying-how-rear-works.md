**Summary of the prompt:** You are asking for clarification on how **Relax-and-Recover (ReaR)** works and whether you need to create both a custom boot disk and a separate backup location, or if both can be stored on the same USB drive.

### **Clarifying How ReaR Works:**

**ReaR** is a disaster recovery tool designed to make it easy to restore your system after failure. It has two main components in its process:

1. **A Bootable Rescue Disk (ISO or USB)**: This is the environment you boot from when performing the recovery. It contains the tools necessary to recover your system, including scripts and configuration files.
2. **The Backup**: This is the actual data being backed up (e.g., your system files, configurations, packages). It can be stored in various places, like an external hard drive, NFS, or even on the same USB device (if it has enough space).

### **How ReaR Can Be Set Up**:

#### **Option 1: Separate Boot Disk and Backup Location**
This is the most common setup and offers more flexibility.

- **Bootable Rescue Disk**: You create a bootable ISO or USB disk with ReaR that allows you to boot into the recovery environment.
- **Backup Location**: The backup data (which includes your entire system's data) is stored in a **separate location**, such as:
  - **An external USB drive**.
  - **A network storage (NFS, SSH, etc.)**.
  - **Cloud storage** (using tools like rclone or s3 compatible storage).

This setup is useful if you want to store backups separately and keep the rescue media independent of the backup itself.

#### **Option 2: Storing Both Rescue Disk and Backup on the Same USB Drive**
It **is possible** to store both the **rescue environment** and the **backup data** on the **same USB drive**, assuming there’s enough space. This method is sometimes referred to as the **backup-to-disk** approach.

Here’s how it works:

- **Bootable USB with Backup**: You create a ReaR bootable USB drive that also holds your system's backup data. When you boot from this USB, it not only contains the recovery environment but also the full backup required for restoring your system.

#### **Steps to Set Up ReaR to Store Both the Boot Disk and Backup on the Same USB Drive**:

1. **Install ReaR** on Fedora:
   ```bash
   sudo dnf install rear
   ```

2. **Configure ReaR for USB Storage**:
   - Open and edit the **ReaR configuration file** `/etc/rear/local.conf`.
   - Specify the output as `USB` and tell ReaR to back up data directly onto the same USB drive. For example:

     ```bash
     OUTPUT=USB
     BACKUP=NETFS
     BACKUP_URL=file:///mnt/usb
     ```

   In this example:
   - `OUTPUT=USB` tells ReaR to create a **bootable USB drive**.
   - `BACKUP=NETFS` and `BACKUP_URL=file:///mnt/usb` instruct ReaR to store the backup on the **same USB drive** (assuming it is mounted as `/mnt/usb` during the backup process).

3. **Create the Bootable USB with Backup**:
   - Insert a USB drive with sufficient space (make sure it has enough capacity to store both the bootable rescue system and the system backup).
   - Run the following ReaR command:
     ```bash
     sudo rear -v mkbackup
     ```

   This will:
   - Create a **bootable rescue system** on the USB drive.
   - Store the system’s **backup data** on the same USB drive.

4. **Boot from the USB and Restore**:
   - In case of system failure or when moving to new hardware, you can boot from this USB drive.
   - The ReaR environment will automatically detect the backup stored on the USB, allowing you to proceed with a full system restoration.

### **Important Considerations**:
- **USB Drive Size**: The USB drive must have enough space to hold both the rescue environment (which is typically small) and your full system backup (which could be large).
- **Speed**: This method is slower than network or external drive backups if your system has a lot of data. USB 3.0 or faster devices are recommended for better performance.
- **Backup Integrity**: Storing both the rescue environment and the backup on the same USB drive makes sense for portability, but it can be a **single point of failure**. If the USB drive gets corrupted or lost, both the boot environment and the backup are lost. For important data, it’s wise to keep another copy of the backup in a separate location (e.g., cloud or external drive).

### **Conclusion**:
Yes, ReaR can store both the **custom boot disk** and the **actual backup data** on the **same USB drive**, assuming it has enough capacity. This setup is useful for simplicity and portability, allowing you to boot and restore your system from a single device. However, for redundancy and safety, it is recommended to keep additional backups in a separate location.
