# Prompt

as I had very bad performance with rclone mount is it worth trying rclone sync? Is it a very different process?

# Output

Yes, using **`rclone sync`** is a different process than using **`rclone mount`**, and it can provide better performance in certain scenarios, especially when working with a large number of files or directories. Here’s a breakdown of the differences and when you might want to use `rclone sync` instead of `rclone mount`:

### Differences Between `rclone sync` and `rclone mount`

1. **Functionality**:
   - **`rclone mount`**: This command creates a virtual filesystem that allows you to interact with files on Google Drive (or other cloud storage) as if they were local files. It is ideal for browsing and working with files in real-time, but it can sometimes be slow due to network latency, especially when accessing a lot of files or directories.
   - **`rclone sync`**: This command synchronizes files between your local filesystem and the remote storage. It copies files from the source (local or remote) to the destination (remote or local), ensuring that both locations are identical. This process can be faster because it transfers only the files that have changed.

2. **Performance**:
   - **`rclone sync`** generally offers better performance for bulk file operations, especially when working with a large number of files. It reduces the overhead associated with real-time file access and minimizes the number of API calls to Google Drive.
   - **`rclone mount`** may experience slowdowns due to directory lookups and metadata retrieval, especially when accessing many files in a directory.

3. **Use Cases**:
   - Use **`rclone mount`** when you want to work with files interactively, such as editing or opening files in applications.
   - Use **`rclone sync`** when you want to back up, transfer, or update files without needing real-time access. It’s ideal for one-off data transfers or backups.

### Example of Using `rclone sync`
If you decide to use `rclone sync`, here’s a basic command to sync a local directory with your Google Shared Drive:

```bash
rclone sync /path/to/local/directory yourbusinessaccounts:/path/to/remote/directory
```

### Important Considerations
- **One-Way Synchronization**: `rclone sync` will make the destination (remote or local) match the source. This means that files deleted in the source will be deleted in the destination as well. Use with caution.
- **Dry Run**: Before performing an actual sync, you can use the `--dry-run` option to see what changes would be made without actually executing them:

  ```bash
  rclone sync /path/to/local/directory yourbusinessaccounts:/path/to/remote/directory --dry-run
  ```

- **Bandwidth Limits**: If you have a large amount of data to sync, consider using the `--bwlimit` option to limit the bandwidth used during the operation, which can help manage network resources.

### Conclusion
If your main goal is to transfer or back up files and you’ve experienced performance issues with `rclone mount`, then switching to `rclone sync` is a worthwhile approach. Just remember that it operates differently and may not provide the interactive experience of mounting. If you need to make regular updates or backups, this method can be much more efficient.
