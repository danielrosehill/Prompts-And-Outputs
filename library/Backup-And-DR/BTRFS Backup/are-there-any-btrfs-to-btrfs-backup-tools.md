**Prompt summary:** You are asking if there are utilities specifically designed for Btrfs-to-Btrfs backups or copies of the kind where snapshots are involved.

Yes, several utilities are designed to handle **Btrfs-to-Btrfs backups** and replication, leveraging Btrfs's unique snapshot and send/receive features. These tools simplify the process of creating incremental backups and syncing Btrfs snapshots between filesystems. Here are some utilities specifically designed for this purpose:

### 1. **btrbk**
   - **Purpose**: `btrbk` is a highly regarded utility for managing Btrfs snapshots and backups. It is designed for creating local and remote backups using Btrfs's `send` and `receive` functionality.
   - **Features**:
     - Automatically creates and manages snapshots.
     - Supports incremental backups using `btrfs send/receive`.
     - Can prune old snapshots based on user-defined retention policies.
     - Can back up to both local and remote Btrfs volumes.
   - **Installation**:
     ```bash
     sudo dnf install btrbk
     ```
   - **Usage Example**: To create a backup configuration:
     ```bash
     sudo btrbk config generate /mnt/backup /dev/sda
     sudo btrbk run
     ```

### 2. **Snapper**
   - **Purpose**: Originally developed by SUSE, `snapper` is another tool for managing Btrfs snapshots. It allows creating, comparing, and restoring snapshots, making it ideal for Btrfs-to-Btrfs backups.
   - **Features**:
     - Creates and manages snapshots.
     - Can take automatic snapshots before and after updates or installations.
     - Supports manual snapshot creation and snapshot rollback.
     - While primarily focused on managing local snapshots, it can be combined with other tools for Btrfs send/receive to perform remote backups.
   - **Installation**:
     ```bash
     sudo dnf install snapper
     ```
   - **Usage Example**: To create a snapshot:
     ```bash
     sudo snapper -c root create --description "Before update"
     ```

### 3. **Sanoid/Syncoid**
   - **Purpose**: Originally created for ZFS, `sanoid` and `syncoid` have been adapted for Btrfs as well. `sanoid` manages snapshots, and `syncoid` replicates them to another system.
   - **Features**:
     - Snapshots management (automatically creates and prunes snapshots).
     - `Syncoid` can replicate snapshots from one Btrfs filesystem to another using Btrfs send/receive.
   - **Installation**:
     ```bash
     sudo dnf install sanoid
     sudo dnf install syncoid
     ```
   - **Usage Example**: To sync snapshots between two Btrfs filesystems:
     ```bash
     syncoid /mnt/source /mnt/backup
     ```

### 4. **btrfs-assistant**
   - **Purpose**: A relatively new graphical tool to manage Btrfs filesystems and backups. It simplifies managing snapshots and setting up Btrfs send/receive replication.
   - **Features**:
     - Provides a graphical interface for managing snapshots and Btrfs send/receive operations.
     - Allows setting up scheduled snapshot creation.
     - Provides easy setup for incremental backups using Btrfs.
   - **Installation**: It's available as a Flatpak:
     ```bash
     flatpak install flathub org.kde.btrfsassistant
     ```

### 5. **btrfs-send-receive**
   - **Purpose**: This is not a full-fledged tool, but a series of scripts designed to simplify `btrfs send` and `receive` operations.
   - **Features**:
     - Automates the process of sending and receiving Btrfs snapshots to a remote location.
     - Handles incremental backups using `btrfs send`.
   - **Usage**: Typically custom scripts that you can adapt to your specific needs.

### 6. **SnapSync**
   - **Purpose**: A lightweight utility that simplifies the process of syncing Btrfs snapshots between filesystems.
   - **Features**:
     - Automatically finds the latest snapshot and transfers it to the backup location.
     - Uses Btrfs send/receive for efficient backups.
     - Manages incremental backups and provides options to delete old snapshots.
   - **Installation & Usage**: Available from GitHub, usually requiring manual setup.

### Which Tool Should You Use?

- **For automated, reliable backups**: **btrbk** is widely regarded as the best tool for managing Btrfs-to-Btrfs backups, especially with incremental snapshot backups and automated pruning.
- **For graphical management**: **btrfs-assistant** offers a user-friendly GUI for managing snapshots and backups.
- **For simpler setups**: **Snapper** or **btrfs-send-receive** scripts are good lightweight alternatives.

These tools streamline the Btrfs snapshot and backup process, making it easier to handle both local and remote backups of your Btrfs system.
