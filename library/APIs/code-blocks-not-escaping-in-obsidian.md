The issue you're experiencing with **code blocks not escaping properly** when pasting into markdown could be due to several common reasons related to markdown formatting, spacing, or copy-pasting issues. Here are a few potential causes and solutions:

### 1. **Incorrect Indentation or Extra Spaces**
- Markdown parsers are **sensitive to indentation**. If there's **inconsistent indentation** or an unexpected space at the start of the code block, markdown may fail to parse it properly.
  - Ensure there are no extra spaces before the backticks (` ``` `) when defining a code block.
  - If copying from an editor like **Microsoft Word** or **Google Docs**, invisible characters might also get copied along, which disrupts formatting.

### 2. **Mixed Code Block Styles**
- There are **two styles of code blocks** in markdown:
  1. **Fenced Code Blocks** (using triple backticks ```):
     ```markdown
     ```
     your code here
     ```
     ```
  2. **Indented Code Blocks** (indented by four spaces or one tab):
     ```markdown
         your code here
     ```
- Make sure you're consistently using the **fenced code block** style, especially when including language hints (like `ini` or `bash`).
- Mixing these styles can confuse markdown parsers.

### 3. **Incorrect Pasting from Rich Text Sources**
- When copying from formatted sources (like Google Docs, Slack, or Word), you may inadvertently copy additional **hidden characters** or **styles** that interfere with markdown rendering.
  - **Solution**: Paste the content into a **plain text editor** (like **Notepad** or **VS Code** without formatting) to strip away hidden styles before copying it again into markdown.

### 4. **Using Backticks Within Code Blocks**
- If you have **single backticks (`)** within a code block, and they are not properly escaped, markdown might not render correctly.
  - In code blocks, use `\`` to escape backticks if they need to appear inside the block.

### 5. **Text Wrapping Issues**
- Sometimes text editors that don’t handle markdown well may wrap or auto-indent lines, breaking the markdown code block.
  - Ensure that **line breaks** aren’t incorrectly inserted when copying, which could make markdown unable to recognize the opening and closing backticks properly.

### Solutions to Consider
1. **Use Markdown Editors**:
   - Use a proper **markdown editor** like **Obsidian**, **VS Code (with Markdown Preview)**, or **Typora**. These editors help visualize and validate if the code blocks are formatted correctly before saving or sharing.

2. **Preview Before Publishing**:
   - Many platforms have a **preview option**. Before publishing, use the preview to confirm the code block appears correctly and fix any escaping issues.

3. **Use Plain Text to Copy**:
   - Copy the text into a **plain text editor** first (e.g., **Notepad**, **gedit**, or **VS Code**) to strip it of any unwanted formatting and then copy it into the markdown file.

4. **Check the Markdown Syntax**:
   - Double-check the **number of backticks** to ensure they are balanced:
     - Opening and closing backticks (` ``` `) must match and be of the same type.

### Example for Proper Markdown Code Blocks

If you have the following:

```markdown
```bash
sudo nano /usr/share/applications/israel-tv-dashboard.desktop
```
```

Ensure it stays consistent when copying and does not get broken like:

```bash
sudo nano /usr/share/applications/israel-tv-dashboard.desktop
```

### Summary
- **Consistent Code Block Markers**: Use triple backticks to open and close your code.
- **Avoid Formatting Issues**: Paste as plain text to avoid invisible formatting characters.
- **Preview**: Always preview your markdown output to check the formatting.

You can also use a dedicated markdown editor to minimize the chances of errors related to formatting, as these tools are specifically designed to parse markdown accurately. Let me know if you need further assistance!
