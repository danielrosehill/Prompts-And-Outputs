For querying **historical news** with very **precise time filtering**, you might consider other news APIs and data providers that are specifically designed for historical archives, with more flexibility in **timestamp resolution** compared to News API. Here are some options that can offer greater granularity:

### **1. Media Cloud**
- **Media Cloud** is an open-source platform that tracks the content of online news media. It provides tools to analyze and visualize how stories and ideas spread through media.
- **Precision Filtering**:
  - Media Cloud allows you to filter by **date and time** with high precision.
  - You can search for articles mentioning specific terms and from a particular date range.
- **Usage**:
  - It has a **search and timeline API** where you can specify keywords, media sets, and date ranges, and retrieve the results. This can be especially helpful if you want to track the spread of a story in the initial hours of an event.

### **2. Event Registry API**
- **Event Registry** aggregates and analyzes news articles from around the world. It’s a good choice for historical news research, allowing you to pinpoint coverage at specific times.
- **Precise Time Filtering**:
  - You can use the **Event Registry API** to search for articles published within specific timeframes and on particular topics.
  - Event Registry also provides rich metadata, including **publication time**, **source**, and **geolocation**, making it ideal for reconstructing news timelines.
- **How to Use**:
  - You can specify precise time ranges using their query options to find articles related to "Hamas" within the first hour of October 7th.

### **3. GDELT (Revisited)**
- While we discussed **GDELT** before, the **GDELT Global Knowledge Graph (GKG)** and **DOC API** can also be quite powerful for precise time-based filtering. The GDELT system indexes content with near real-time precision and records timestamps in the **YYYYMMDDHHMMSS** format, allowing you to filter news down to very specific moments.
- GDELT offers both **event-level** and **article-level** data that can be queried through its API, allowing you to locate the exact time news stories were reported.

### **4. LexisNexis Newsdesk**
- **LexisNexis** is well known for its comprehensive news archive services. Their **Newsdesk API** can provide extensive **historical news coverage** with precise timestamp filtering.
- **Precision and Filtering**:
  - You can search by keywords and limit the search to a specific **hour** or even narrower if necessary.
  - They provide access to a vast repository of news articles, which makes it suitable for reconstructing detailed timelines of news events.
- **Access**:
  - **LexisNexis** is a premium service and typically requires a subscription, but it is one of the most reliable sources for historical news coverage.

### **5. Wayback Machine API (Internet Archive)**
- The **Wayback Machine** offers an API that you can use to check for snapshots of news websites at a specific point in time.
- **Time-based Filtering**:
  - You won’t get an exact news article metadata, but it’s helpful to see how different news outlets covered the event during specific time intervals. If a site has been captured at or near the hour after the attack, you can see what was published.
- **API Access**:
  - Example API request to check for snapshots:
    ```bash
    https://archive.org/wayback/available?url=bbc.com&timestamp=20231007033000
    ```
  - This could be useful for checking if international sources, such as **BBC**, captured events and at what time.

### **6. Bloomberg Terminal (for News)**
- **Bloomberg** provides detailed historical news coverage via their **Bloomberg Terminal**. You can view news reports, timestamps, and any changes over time.
- **Filtering Precision**:
  - The Bloomberg Terminal allows you to filter news data by very specific time intervals and view how headlines and stories evolved, particularly during market-moving events.
- **Access**:
  - Like **LexisNexis**, **Bloomberg** is a premium service and generally requires a subscription.

### **Summary**:
- **Media Cloud** and **Event Registry** offer more accessible APIs for tracking news with precision and filtering by specific times.
- **LexisNexis Newsdesk** and **Bloomberg Terminal** are premium options that provide detailed historical coverage and precise time filtering.
- **GDELT** remains an excellent choice for near-real-time tracking and article-level data, particularly with event-level granularity.
- **Wayback Machine API** is useful for capturing snapshots of news sites at specific times, though not strictly for metadata extraction.

Depending on your **budget** and the **level of detail** you need, any of these options could work. For a more accessible option, **Media Cloud** and **Event Registry** are good places to start. If you need comprehensive historical data with high granularity, **LexisNexis** or **Bloomberg** might be the best options, albeit at a cost. Let me know which direction you'd like to explore further!
