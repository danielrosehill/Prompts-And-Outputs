# Prompt

are there any platforms intended for managing lots of API keys as a solo developer? I use 1 Password and like it but it might be nice to have a purpose built tool for API credential storage also

# Output
Yes, there are several platforms designed specifically for managing API keys and other developer credentials. Here are a few options:

1. **Vault by HashiCorp**: This is an open-source tool that can securely store API keys, passwords, and other sensitive information. It provides advanced features like dynamic secrets, access control, and audit logs.

2. **AWS Secrets Manager**: If you're using AWS services, this is a good option for securely storing API keys and credentials. It integrates seamlessly with other AWS services and offers automatic rotation of secrets.

3. **Azure Key Vault**: Similar to AWS Secrets Manager but for the Azure ecosystem, this service helps securely store and manage API keys, passwords, certificates, and other secrets.

4. **Bitwarden**: While it’s more commonly known as a password manager, Bitwarden also allows for storing API keys. It’s open-source and offers strong encryption and multi-factor authentication.

5. **Doppler**: This tool is specifically designed for developers to manage environment variables and secrets like API keys. Doppler makes it easy to manage secrets across different environments and teams, even as a solo developer.

6. **1Password Secrets Automation**: Since you already use 1Password, you might consider their Secrets Automation feature. It extends 1Password’s functionality to securely store API keys and other secrets, with automated access controls.

These tools offer varying levels of complexity and integration with other services, so the best choice depends on your specific needs and the ecosystem you’re working within.## Extracted Prompts
