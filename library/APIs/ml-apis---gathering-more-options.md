# Prompt

Let's look into the ML option. Give me a few options. I'd like to use ML to aggregate the news and then summarise it. Then I guess I could pass that onto the next stage of the process. Suggest some platforms in addition to BigML that might be affordable
# Output

Absolutely, I understand your goal of creating **automated SITREPs** (Situational Reports) about **geopolitical developments in Israel**. Let's break down how each of the **ML platforms** I mentioned earlier can be specifically used to help you achieve this goal. I'll walk through the exact roles each platform can play in aggregating, processing, and summarizing news content effectively.

### 3. **Amazon Comprehend**: NLP for Entity Recognition and Summarization
- **Role in the Workflow**:
  - **Entity Recognition and Topic Detection**: Amazon Comprehend can analyze the articles to extract key **entities** (e.g., organizations, people) and **topics**, helping to understand which geopolitical issues are being addressed.
  - **Key Phrases Extraction**: It can also extract **key phrases** that represent the most crucial information, which you can then use for **manual aggregation** or pass to a summarization tool.
  
- **Specific Steps for SITREP**:
  1. **Fetch Articles**: Aggregate news using any news API like NewsCatcher.
  2. **Entity & Topic Analysis**: Use **Amazon Comprehend** to extract entities and topics, which helps to understand the primary focus of each article. For example, it can identify entities like **"Hizbullah"** or **"West Bank"**.
  3. **Create Short Summary**: Extract **key phrases** and use them to create a short overview of each topic.
  4. **Pass to GPT-3.5 for Final Summary**: Send the extracted data to GPT-3.5 to generate a **context-aware SITREP**, integrating insights from multiple sources.

- **Advantages**:
  - **Powerful Analysis Tools**: Amazon Comprehend can help break down articles into **entities, topics, and key phrases**, which provides a better understanding for summarization.
  - **Seamless Integration with AWS**: Works well if you're already using AWS services for hosting your automation.
