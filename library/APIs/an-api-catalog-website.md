# Prompt

I often find myself wondering "is there an API for that?" Can you recommend any reputable catalog that gathers together a list of APIs and which includes many free options for non profit users?

# Output

Yes, there are several reputable catalogs and resources that gather lists of APIs, including many free options that could be useful for non-profit users. Here are some recommendations:

1. ProgrammableWeb:
   This is one of the most comprehensive API directories available. It includes a vast collection of APIs across various categories, with many free options. You can filter by category, protocol, and pricing model (including free).

2. RapidAPI Hub:
   RapidAPI provides a large marketplace of APIs, including many free and freemium options. It allows you to test APIs directly from the browser and offers easy integration.

3. GitHub - Public API Lists:
   There's a popular GitHub repository called "Public APIs" that maintains a collective list of free APIs for use in software and web development. It's community-driven and regularly updated[6].

4. API List:
   This website categorizes APIs by industry and provides information on authentication methods, HTTPS support, and CORS.

5. Nonprofit Open Data Collective:
   This resource specifically focuses on APIs and data sources relevant to nonprofit research. It includes links to several APIs that provide nonprofit-specific data[5].

6. Candid APIs:
   Candid (formerly Foundation Center and GuideStar) offers APIs specifically designed for accessing nonprofit and philanthropic data. While not all are free, they do offer some options that might be accessible for nonprofits[2].

7. Any-API:
   This is a directory of free APIs that allows you to search and test APIs directly from their website.

8. Google APIs Explorer:
   While not a catalog of third-party APIs, Google offers many of its own APIs for free or with generous free tiers that could be useful for nonprofits.

Remember that while many of these APIs offer free tiers, they may have usage limits or require authentication. Always check the terms of service and usage policies, especially for nonprofit use.

For nonprofit-specific needs, you might also want to look into services like TechSoup, which partners with tech companies to provide discounted or free software and services (including some API access) to qualified nonprofits.
