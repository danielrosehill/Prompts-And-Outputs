# Prompt

The issue I have with using 3.5 is that I think OpenAI limit you to $50 of spend on the API per month. Is there some model that would be similarly cost effective but which might be availble from a platform taht doesn't impose such a limit

# Output

If you're looking for a model similar to **OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo** but without the **$50 monthly limit** imposed by OpenAI, there are a few other platforms and APIs that offer competitive pricing and more flexibility with spending limits. Here are some options:

### **1. Hugging Face Inference API**
Hugging Face provides access to a wide range of open-source models, including GPT-like models, and offers a pay-as-you-go pricing model without restrictive monthly spending limits. This could be a great alternative to OpenAI, especially if you’re running many classification tasks.

- **Models**: You can use models like **GPT-NeoX**, **GPT-J**, **LLaMA**, **Falcon**, and more, which offer similar performance to GPT-3.5 Turbo for text classification tasks.
- **Pricing**: The pricing for Hugging Face is based on **compute time** rather than tokens. For most models, the pricing starts at **$0.06 per second** of compute time.
  - For classification tasks, assuming **2-5 seconds per request**, the cost would be **$0.12 to $0.30 per file**.
  - For 1,500 markdown files, you’re looking at a total cost ranging between **$180 and $450** depending on the model and complexity.
- **Key Benefit**: Hugging Face has no strict spending limits, and you pay only for the resources you use.

### **2. Cohere API**
Cohere provides NLP models for tasks like classification, generation, and more. Their **classification API** could work well for your use case, and it offers flexible pricing without the monthly spending cap that OpenAI enforces.

- **Pricing**: Cohere charges **$0.0025 per token** for classification tasks, and for 1,500-token markdown files, the cost per file is **$3.75**.
- **Total cost for 1,500 files**: Approximately **$5,625**, which may be costlier than OpenAI for your use case, but offers higher flexibility for specialized classification tasks.
- **Key Benefit**: No strict monthly limits and flexible pay-as-you-go pricing.

### **3. Google Cloud AI (Vertex AI)**
Google Cloud offers **Vertex AI**, a platform where you can run **large-scale NLP tasks** like classification. They have competitive pricing, and while their **PaLM API** isn't as cheap as GPT-3.5, you can explore other pre-trained models available on the platform.

- **Pricing**: Google charges based on **compute time** and offers **$300 in free credits** to start with. Pricing depends on the model and instance you use, so it might be flexible compared to OpenAI’s limits.
- **Key Benefit**: Google's infrastructure can handle large-scale tasks with flexible spending limits and robust model support.

### **4. Anthropic's Claude**
Anthropic’s **Claude models** offer similar capabilities to GPT-3.5 Turbo, and the company doesn’t impose strict spending limits like OpenAI.

- **Pricing**: Anthropic's pricing varies based on usage and model size, but it is competitive with OpenAI.
- **Use Case**: Claude models are highly effective for classification tasks, though you may need to inquire directly about custom enterprise pricing for large-volume use.
  
### **5. **Aleph Alpha** (European AI Model)
Aleph Alpha is a **European AI provider** that offers highly capable models for various NLP tasks like classification, generation, and summarization. This could be a great alternative to OpenAI for those looking to avoid strict spending limits.

- **Pricing**: Pricing information is available on a **per-project basis**, but they tend to offer competitive pricing for businesses with flexible budgets.
- **Key Benefit**: No strict spending limits and they focus on **European privacy regulations** if data handling is a concern.

### **Best Option for Your Case**
If you're primarily concerned with avoiding strict spending limits, **Hugging Face's Inference API** and **Google Cloud AI** (Vertex AI) are likely the best options. Both provide flexible pricing models with no imposed spending caps and a wide range of LLMs that can handle text classification efficiently.

For the **best cost-efficiency**:
- **Hugging Face** would allow you to choose between various open-source models (like GPT-NeoX, Falcon, etc.) that are similar to GPT-3.5, with no monthly cap.
- **Google Cloud AI** would provide strong infrastructure and pricing flexibility if you prefer a cloud-based option.

You can easily integrate both with Python for a similar workflow to what you would use with OpenAI’s API.
