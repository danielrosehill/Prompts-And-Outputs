  - **Embedding Visual Content**: Export mind maps as **images (PNG)** or **PDFs** and store them within your vault. Embedding these images into related notes can help create a more cohesive understanding of your ideas.

Using these tools alongside **Obsidian** can help you take advantage of both **visual mapping** and **markdown-based knowledge management**, creating a hybrid system that is both structured and highly flexible—an ideal setup for managing lots of interlinked ideas effectively.
