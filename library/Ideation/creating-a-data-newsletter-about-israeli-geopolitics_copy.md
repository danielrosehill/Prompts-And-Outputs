# Prompt

We looked previously at indications of warming ties with Israel and with signs indicating the opposite - growing hostility. Putting those two trains of thought together, can you think of how one might go about building a data-driven weekly data analysis newsletter highlighting the shifting trends in global geopolitical sentiment towards Israel as evidenced by these concrete manifestations. The object of the analysis would be to highlight that actions speak louder than words. Sometimes, small actions like individual votes at UN resolutions might be overlooked. But they could colletively signal how the international community is reshaping in how it relates to Israel. I'd like thoughts on what data to collect, how to aggregate and analyse it, and how to present findings in an informative and data-driven way

# Output

A data-driven newsletter focused on analyzing shifting global sentiment toward Israel could be both insightful and impactful, especially when capturing granular shifts over time. Here’s a blueprint for what to collect, how to aggregate and analyze the data, and ways to present the findings effectively.

### **1. Key Data Points to Collect**
   - **Diplomatic Actions**: Track events like embassy openings, closures, consulate downgrades, and new bilateral agreements or partnerships.
   - **UN Voting Patterns**: Monitor voting trends in UN resolutions relevant to Israel, especially shifts from countries that traditionally abstained or supported Israel.
   - **Economic and Trade Indicators**: Focus on new trade deals, changes in import/export statistics, sanctions, or economic divestments targeting Israeli companies.
   - **Defense and Military Cooperation**: Note changes in defense agreements, joint exercises, and intelligence-sharing deals.
   - **Cultural and Academic Collaborations**: Track participation in joint academic programs, cultural exchanges, and BDS-related exclusions.
   - **Public Sentiment Metrics**: For a qualitative touch, include major international opinion polls, public statements from prominent international leaders, and relevant media sentiment analysis.

### **2. Aggregating and Analyzing the Data**
   - **Weekly Sentiment Score**: Assign weighted sentiment scores to actions, with more significant diplomatic events (e.g., establishing or closing embassies) carrying more weight than smaller actions (e.g., individual votes). This creates a weekly score reflecting positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.
   - **Category-Based Tracking**: Divide events into categories (e.g., diplomatic, economic, defense, cultural), and analyze each to see where shifts are most prominent. Highlighting changes within each category can reveal which areas are undergoing the most movement.
   - **Geographic Shifts**: Map sentiments by region (e.g., Europe, Asia, Latin America) to capture regional trends over time, which can show growing or declining favorability.
   - **Historical Comparison**: Compare current data to past weeks, months, or years. This historical context can show whether current trends are accelerating, stagnating, or reversing.

### **3. Presentation and Visualization Techniques**
   - **Trend Graphs and Heatmaps**:
     - **Trend Graphs**: Use line graphs to display sentiment scores over time for each category (diplomatic, economic, defense, cultural) to visualize peaks or drops in sentiment.
     - **Heatmaps**: Use global heatmaps or regional breakdowns to show where sentiment is warming or cooling toward Israel.
   - **Event-Specific Highlights**: Summarize notable events each week (e.g., major votes, announcements) in brief sections that explain their potential impact and context.
   - **Comparative Weekly Overview**: Include a small table that shows last week’s sentiment score versus this week’s, giving readers a quick reference point for shifts.
   - **Category-Specific Sections**: Dedicate sections to each category (e.g., diplomatic moves, defense, economic) with short summaries and relevant data points for easy scanning.

### **4. Insights and Analysis**
   - **Action Impact Scores**: Introduce a section where small actions—like individual UN votes or statements from key international figures—are briefly analyzed for their potential ripple effects. Even actions that seem minor could indicate subtle alignment or hostility shifts.
   - **Monthly Deep Dive**: Once per month, provide a more comprehensive report or editorial that connects the weekly shifts into a broader narrative. This section can track emerging trends, assess diplomatic “pivots,” and speculate on future implications based on current momentum.
   - **Audience Engagement and Feedback**: Invite readers to share insights, especially if they work in diplomatic or international relations. This could help refine what data matters most to the audience and make the newsletter more responsive to reader interests.

By focusing on concrete actions and visualizing trends, this newsletter could offer a reliable, data-centric lens on Israel’s shifting international standing—helping readers to interpret nuanced diplomatic moves and highlighting the power of small actions in shaping perceptions.
