**Summary of your prompt:** You are building a monitoring dashboard to stay updated on news in Israel and are looking for examples of similar projects created by private citizens for the public good. Specifically, you're interested in what kind of information they chose to display in their dashboards.

There have been numerous instances where private citizens have developed dashboards for the public good, often during times of crisis or when there is a need for real-time, organized information. Here are a few notable examples and the types of information they included:

### 1. **COVID-19 Tracking Dashboards**
   - **Developers:** Several private citizens, including university students, created COVID-19 dashboards at the start of the pandemic, some of which became globally known.
   - **Key Information Displayed:**
     - Real-time case numbers by region/country.
     - Death and recovery rates.
     - Hospitalization data.
     - Vaccination rates.
     - Testing availability and results.
     - Visual maps showing areas with outbreaks.
   - **Example:** The Johns Hopkins COVID-19 Dashboard, initially developed by a small team for public use.

### 2. **Election Monitoring Dashboards**
   - **Developers:** Political activists and technologists have created dashboards to monitor election-related data, aiming to provide transparent, real-time updates on voting, counting, and potential irregularities.
   - **Key Information Displayed:**
     - Polling station data (open/closed, turnout, reported issues).
     - Real-time election results.
     - Voting irregularities or issues (e.g., voter suppression, broken machines).
     - Voter demographics and turnout trends.
     - Social media sentiment analysis around election topics.
   - **Example:** The Election Integrity Partnership in the US, which combined data sources to monitor misinformation and threats to election integrity.

### 3. **Disaster Relief Dashboards**
   - **Developers:** In the wake of natural disasters, private individuals have developed dashboards to assist communities in need.
   - **Key Information Displayed:**
     - Shelter locations and status.
     - Food and water distribution points.
     - Real-time weather conditions and forecasts.
     - Road closures and transit availability.
     - Rescue and volunteer efforts.
   - **Example:** The Houston Harvey Rescue dashboard, built by a group of software engineers after Hurricane Harvey.

### 4. **Environmental Monitoring Dashboards**
   - **Developers:** Some environmental activists have created dashboards to track and report on pollution levels, deforestation, and other environmental factors.
   - **Key Information Displayed:**
     - Air and water quality (real-time pollution levels).
     - Deforestation rates.
     - Carbon emissions data.
     - Satellite imagery of deforestation or fires.
     - Health risks associated with environmental factors.
   - **Example:** The World Air Quality Index, which provides real-time air pollution levels across the globe.

### 5. **Crisis Response Dashboards (Israel-Specific)**
   - **Developers:** Private citizens in Israel have built dashboards to track the security situation, especially during escalations of violence.
   - **Key Information Displayed:**
     - Red alert warnings (air raid sirens).
     - Real-time rocket attack information and location mapping.
     - Safe zone information and bomb shelter locations.
     - Updates from emergency services and local government advisories.
     - Livestream feeds of news reports or social media updates.
   - **Example:** **Tzeva Adom** apps and community-run websites for tracking alerts during conflicts.

For your Israel news dashboard, you might want to combine elements from these projects, focusing on:
   - Real-time security alerts (e.g., Tzeva Adom or emergency alerts).
   - Political and geopolitical updates (including RSS feeds from local TV and radio stations).
   - Social media sentiment analysis (to gauge public response to events).
   - Maps with hot spots showing developments in different regions.
   - Live news feed and notifications for breaking stories.

These examples show how private citizens can successfully develop platforms that provide real-time, actionable information for the public.
