# Prompt

Good start but I'd like you to dig a bit deeper. Web EOC for example seemed promising but if it's used by govs I can't imagine it's easily accessible. Any open source equivalents or those which have a free tier for private users?

# Output

You're right to look for more accessible alternatives to WebEOC, especially open-source or free options for private users. Let me provide some more targeted suggestions:

1. Ushahidi:
   - Open-source platform for information collection, visualization, and interactive mapping
   - Can be self-hosted or used as a cloud service
   - Free for self-hosted installations
   - Useful for crisis mapping and community reporting

2. Sahana Eden:
   - Open-source disaster management platform
   - Highly customizable and can be adapted for various emergency scenarios
   - Free to use and self-host
   - Includes modules for resource management, situational awareness, and volunteer coordination

3. OpenCOP:
   - Open-source Common Operating Picture software
   - Designed for emergency management and situational awareness
   - Can be self-hosted
   - Includes mapping and collaboration features

4. DIORAMA:
   - Open-source disaster management platform
   - Focuses on real-time collaboration and information sharing
   - Can be deployed locally or in the cloud
   - Includes features for resource tracking and incident management

5. Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) Tasking Manager:
   - While not a full emergency management system, it's a valuable open-source tool for coordinating mapping efforts during crises
   - Free to use and can be integrated with other systems

6. D4H (mentioned earlier):
   - While not open-source, they offer a free tier for small teams or individuals
   - Provides incident management, equipment management, and personnel tracking features

7. Veoci:
   - Offers a free tier for small organizations or individual users
   - Includes basic emergency management and planning tools

These options provide a range of features that can be useful for creating a monitoring dashboard or emergency management system. They're more accessible than government-focused solutions like WebEOC and can be adapted for various scales of use, from individual to community level.

When choosing a platform, consider factors like:
- Ease of deployment and customization
- Community support and documentation
- Integration capabilities with other tools (e.g., social media feeds, news APIs)
- Mobile accessibility
- Data privacy and security features

Remember that while these tools provide a foundation, you may need to customize them to create the specific quadrant-style dashboard with live TV and social media feeds that you described earlier.
