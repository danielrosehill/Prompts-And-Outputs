# Prompt

As you know, I'm trying to set up my own system for getting daily geopolitical alerts about Israel. I'm open to various ways of setting it up. I think it makes sense to use a  few different news sources as inputs. But ultimately I'd like to run it through an LLM to make intelligent decisions about what information to highlight. Do you have any suggestions for implementation?

# Output

To set up a system for getting daily geopolitical alerts about Israel, and to process the data intelligently using a language model (LLM), you can follow a multi-step approach that incorporates data ingestion, processing, and filtering. Here's a high-level plan:

### 1. **Source Collection and Ingestion**
You’ll need to set up a system that pulls data from multiple sources automatically. Consider a mix of RSS feeds, APIs, and web scrapers for this:

#### A. **News Sources**
   - **RSS Feeds**: Many news agencies and sites offer RSS feeds which you can use to regularly fetch updates. Set up feeds from:
     - Reuters (Middle East section)
     - The Times of Israel
     - Al Jazeera (Middle East)
     - Haaretz
     - Jerusalem Post
   - **APIs**: Some sources, like news aggregators, offer APIs. You can use services like:
     - **NewsAPI**: Offers access to articles from many news outlets. Filter by topic (Israel, Gaza, Middle East).
     - **GDELT**: A global news database offering real-time updates on conflict and geopolitical issues.
   - **Social Media**:
     - Use tools like **Tweepy** (for Twitter/X API) to fetch real-time updates from key accounts (e.g., IDF Spokesperson, Israeli Ministry of Defense).
   - **Web Scraping**: Use Python libraries like **BeautifulSoup** or **Scrapy** to pull data from websites that don't offer APIs or RSS feeds.

#### B. **Store the Data**
   - Use a **relational database** (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) to store raw data or opt for something simpler like **SQLite**.
   - Alternatively, if you’re planning a quick setup, use **NoSQL** (e.g., MongoDB) to store structured or semi-structured data (articles, tweets, headlines, etc.).

### 2. **Preprocessing the Data**
   - **Data Cleaning**: Implement data cleaning scripts that remove duplicates, strip unnecessary HTML tags, and unify formats (timestamps, etc.).
   - **Metadata Extraction**: Extract key metadata like:
     - **Headline**
     - **Source**
     - **Time Published**
     - **Geographical Location** (use geolocation APIs if needed)
     - **Categories** (conflict, diplomacy, cyber, etc.)

### 3. **Processing the Data with an LLM**
Once you’ve ingested and cleaned the data, run it through an LLM to summarize and highlight the most important information. Here are some suggestions:

#### A. **LLM Deployment Options**
   - **Use OpenAI API (GPT)**: You can call the API to process and summarize daily news based on specific criteria (e.g., articles related to Israel's defense, emerging threats).
   - **Hugging Face Transformers**: If you prefer an open-source model, deploy a summarization model using Hugging Face (e.g., **Bart**, **T5**, or **GPT-NeoX**).
   - **LLM via Local Deployment**: You can host smaller models on your local machine or server. Depending on resources, you could fine-tune or use pre-trained models.

#### B. **Processing Workflow**
   1. **Summarization**: Use the LLM to summarize long articles or extract key points from social media threads.
   2. **Sentiment Analysis**: Run sentiment analysis on articles to gauge the tone (e.g., positive, negative, neutral).
   3. **Entity Recognition**: Extract named entities (e.g., key figures, organizations, locations) to understand who or what is involved.
   4. **Priority Filtering**: Based on predefined conditions (e.g., "new military developments", "international sanctions", "UN response"), highlight articles that match certain criteria.
   5. **Customizable Alerts**: Let the LLM flag or score the importance of an article. For example, prioritize military updates over general political ones.

### 4. **Visualization and Alerts**
Once the LLM processes the data, you’ll need an interface to view the alerts and reports:

#### A. **Daily Summary Report**
   - Create a daily email digest with the highlights. Use tools like **SendGrid** to automate email reports.
   - Or, if you prefer, generate a simple **HTML report** stored locally on your machine, listing the most important updates, sorted by category or priority.

#### B. **Dashboard for Monitoring**
   - Set up a **dashboard** using a Python framework like **Dash** or **Streamlit**:
     - Display the most critical alerts.
     - Include sections for categorized information (military, diplomacy, economic impacts).
     - Show real-time data feeds (use streaming APIs for live news updates).

#### C. **Desktop Notifications**
   - Use **Libnotify** or similar tools to trigger desktop notifications for high-priority alerts in real-time.

### 5. **Automation**
   - Use **cron jobs** or a task scheduler to:
     - Fetch data from the sources at regular intervals (e.g., every 30 minutes or hourly).
     - Process the data with the LLM.
     - Generate the daily reports and send out alerts.

### Suggested Tools and Libraries:
   - **Data Collection**: `NewsAPI`, `GDELT`, `BeautifulSoup`, `Scrapy`, `Tweepy`.
   - **Data Storage**: `PostgreSQL`, `MongoDB`.
   - **LLM APIs**: `OpenAI GPT`, `Hugging Face Transformers`.
   - **Processing**: `NLTK`, `spaCy` (for entity recognition and sentiment analysis).
   - **Dashboard**: `Dash`, `Streamlit`, `Matplotlib` for visual representation.
   - **Automation**: `cron` jobs, `Celery` for task queues.

### Next Steps:
1. Start by setting up a basic data ingestion pipeline (RSS feeds, APIs).
2. Experiment with an LLM for summarization and filtering.
3. Build a simple alert system (email, dashboard, or notifications).
4. Test and refine based on the type of information you want to prioritize.
