# Prompt

are there any websites which allow you to develop custom dashboards for private use and display?  I would like to show a media monitoring dashboard I've built on a few of my devices. Please note: it's primarily a dashboard for displaying live news streams rather than data, so that would need to be supported (the streams are simply embedded websites)

# Output

For a media monitoring dashboard focused on displaying live news streams, including embedded websites, you can use the following platforms that support custom dashboards with website embedding capabilities:

### 1. **Glide Apps**
   - **Features**: Glide allows you to create custom mobile apps and web-based dashboards. You can embed web pages and live news streams using the Web View component. It’s ideal for a responsive dashboard accessible on multiple devices.
   - **Access**: Access your dashboard as a mobile app or through a web link. Glide supports private sharing and requires authentication for access control.

### 2. **Notion**
   - **Features**: Notion is flexible and supports the embedding of live websites, including news streams. You can organize different streams within pages and sections, making it easy to set up a comprehensive media monitoring dashboard.
   - **Access**: You can share the Notion page privately with specific users or keep it accessible only to yourself. It’s accessible on desktop and mobile devices.

### 3. **Tableau Public (Private Version)**
   - **Features**: Tableau is more commonly used for data visualization but also supports web page embedding within its dashboards. You can create a private Tableau dashboard (via Tableau Server or Tableau Online) and embed live news streams into it.
   - **Access**: This setup allows access on different devices, and if you host it on Tableau Online, you can securely share it with others.

### 4. **Dash by Plotly**
   - **Features**: Dash is a Python framework that lets you create custom web apps and dashboards. It supports embedding websites and live streams, so you could build a tailored dashboard to suit your media monitoring needs. 
   - **Access**: Deploy it on a private server or cloud service to make it accessible across your devices. It offers robust privacy options, including password protection.

### 5. **WordPress with Custom Page Builders**
   - **Features**: You can use WordPress with a page builder plugin like Elementor or Divi to create a dashboard page that supports embedded websites and streams. This can be customized to match the layout you want.
   - **Access**: Set up a private WordPress site and password-protect the dashboard page, making it accessible only to you or selected users.
