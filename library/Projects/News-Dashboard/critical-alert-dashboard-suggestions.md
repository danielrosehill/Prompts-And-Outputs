# Prompt

Could you create one more dashboard from the list of URLs you have in context? This time let's focus on a critical update dashboard. We'll want the Red Alerts app from Pikud HaOref. Kan, i24 News. You can suggest a few more additions and give me some specific ideas for ways to lay it out.

# Output

For a **Critical Update Dashboard**, the goal is to have real-time monitoring of **urgent and impactful events**—specifically alerts, breaking news, and verified updates from authoritative sources. Here’s a detailed plan for your critical update dashboard:

### **Sources for the Critical Update Dashboard**

   - **Red Alert (Rocket Alerts)**: Provides real-time notifications of rocket attacks across Israel.

2. **Kan (Public Broadcasting)**

   - **Channel 12 Live**: [https://www.mako.co.il/mako-vod-live-tv/VOD-6540b8dcb64fd31006.htm](https://www.mako.co.il/mako-vod-live-tv/VOD-6540b8dcb64fd31006.htm)

### **Suggested Layout for the Critical Update Dashboard**
To ensure all critical updates are easily visible and logically categorized, here’s a suggested layout with sections and how to organize them:

#### **1. Real-Time Alerts Section (Top Priority)**
   - **Red Alerts (Rocket Alerts) and Pikud HaOref Alerts**:
     - Use an iframe or widget to show real-time **alerts from Pikud HaOref**.
     - This section should be the most prominent on the dashboard—placed at the top of the screen.
     - Make it **color-coded** (e.g., red background) to draw attention immediately when an alert is triggered.
     - Integrate **Telegram Widget** if available for the **Red Alert Telegram channel** to see the alerts live.

#### **2. Live News Streams (Central Focus)**
   - **Kan Live Stream**:
     - Embed the **Kan live broadcast** in the middle of the dashboard to provide ongoing coverage.
   - **i24 News Stream**:
     - Place it next to the Kan stream, allowing comparison between **domestic** and **international** coverage.
   - **Channel 12 News**:
     - Split the layout to fit the **Channel 12 stream** alongside Kan and i24.
   - **Layout Idea**:
     - Use a **three-column** layout for live streams, allowing all three streams to be watched simultaneously.
     - Make use of **picture-in-picture (PiP)** for any one stream while browsing other sections if your browser supports it.

#### **3. Official Twitter Updates Section**
   - **IDF, Ministry of Foreign Affairs**:
     - Add **Twitter widgets** for official accounts like **IDF** and **Ministry of Foreign Affairs**.
     - Use a **two-column layout** beneath the live streams:
       - One column for **IDF Twitter** and the other for **Ministry of Foreign Affairs Twitter**.
   - This section should provide **scrollable feeds** so you can get an immediate glance at recent updates.

#### **4. Regional and International Perspective Section**
   - **Al Jazeera and Sky News Coverage**:
     - Include an **iframe** or a widget to pull in live updates or breaking news from both **Al Jazeera** and **Sky News**.
     - These sources will add a broader **regional perspective**, allowing you to gauge how international entities perceive ongoing events.
   - Place this section **below the Twitter updates** to maintain hierarchical priority (alerts at the top, followed by government updates, and then international perspectives).

### **Technical Layout Implementation Suggestions**
1. **Grid Layout (CSS Grid or Flexbox)**:
   - Use **CSS Grid** or **Flexbox** to create a responsive dashboard layout.
   - Example Layout:
     ```html
     <div class="grid-container">
       <div class="alerts"> <!-- Red Alerts Section --> </div>
       <div class="stream1"> <!-- Kan Live Stream --> </div>
       <div class="stream2"> <!-- i24 News Live Stream --> </div>
       <div class="stream3"> <!-- Channel 12 Live Stream --> </div>
       <div class="twitter1"> <!-- IDF Twitter Feed --> </div>
       <div class="twitter2"> <!-- Ministry of Foreign Affairs Twitter Feed --> </div>
       <div class="intl1"> <!-- Al Jazeera Coverage --> </div>
       <div class="intl2"> <!-- Sky News Coverage --> </div>
     </div>
     ```

     ```css
     .grid-container {
       display: grid;
       grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;
       grid-template-rows: auto;
       gap: 10px;
     }
     .alerts {
       grid-column: span 3;
       background-color: #ffcccc;
       padding: 10px;
     }
     .stream1, .stream2, .stream3 {
       height: 300px;
     }
     .twitter1, .twitter2, .intl1, .intl2 {
       height: 200px;
       overflow: scroll;
     }
     ```

2. **Auto-Refresh and Real-Time Updates**:
   - Use **JavaScript** to **auto-refresh** the Red Alert and Twitter sections to get real-time updates without manually refreshing the dashboard.
   - You could use an API or `setInterval()` function to refresh specific parts of the dashboard.

3. **Prioritize Alert Visibility**:
   - The **alert section** should have **visual emphasis**—a bright color or a larger size. This ensures that anyone looking at the dashboard knows immediately if there’s an emergency.

### **Tools to Use**
- **Netvibes** or **Geckoboard**:
  - Both platforms can be used to build **custom dashboards** with widgets for live streams, Twitter feeds, and news updates.
- **Inoreader**:
  - Use **Inoreader** to aggregate RSS feeds from these sources, such as breaking news feeds from **Al Jazeera** and **Sky News**.
- **Custom HTML/PWA**:
  - For a self-hosted, always-on solution, consider building a **custom HTML page** and convert it to a **PWA** using **PWA Builder** or **Nativefier** to display all the sources in one screen, accessible from Fedora as a desktop app.

### **Summary of the Layout**
1. **Top Section (Full Width)**:
   - **Red Alerts and Rocket Alerts**: Highlighted in red with high visibility.

2. **Middle Section (Three Columns)**:
   - **Kan Live Stream**, **i24 News**, **Channel 12 News**: Side-by-side live streams for continuous coverage.

3. **Below the Live Streams (Two Columns)**:
   - **Twitter Updates**: IDF and Ministry of Foreign Affairs Twitter feeds for real-time government and military updates.

4. **Bottom Section (Two Columns)**:
   - **International News**: Al Jazeera and Sky News for broader international perspectives.

This dashboard layout will ensure that all critical updates are visible at a glance, with easy access to ongoing alerts, live streams, and official statements, providing a comprehensive overview during critical events. Let me know if you need help building this out further!
