# Prompt

I live in Israel where we recently had a spate of missile attacks from Iran. I missed the news that day and didn't learn about the impeding attack until the last minute. As a result of that experience I'm working on developing a monitoring app for display on things like TVs and tablets during times of crisis. The idea is to create a continuous display of some key information sources including national government news, social media use, and international coverage. Can you suggest some functionalities and features for this app and how it should be layed out? Would you care to suggest a design and what sources should be included?

# Output

I understand you're developing a monitoring app for crisis situations in Israel, based on your recent experience with missile attacks. Here are some suggestions for functionalities, features, layout, and design for such an app:

Key Functionalities and Features:

1. Real-time alerts: Integrate with official government warning systems.
2. Multi-source news aggregation: Local and international news feeds.
3. Social media monitoring: Curated feeds from official accounts and trending hashtags.
4. Interactive map: Show locations of incidents, shelters, and safe zones.
5. Emergency contact information: Quick access to emergency services.
6. Customizable alerts: Allow users to set preferences for types of alerts.
7. Offline mode: Essential information available without internet connection.
8. Multi-language support: Hebrew, Arabic, English at minimum.

Layout and Design:

1. Main Dashboard:
   - Top banner: Current alert level and latest critical updates
   - Left panel: Official government news feed
   - Center panel: Interactive map
   - Right panel: Social media feed
   - Bottom ticker: International news headlines

2. Secondary Screens (swipeable):
   - Detailed alerts and instructions
   - Emergency contacts and resources
   - User settings and preferences

3. Design Principles:
   - High contrast for readability
   - Large, clear fonts
   - Intuitive icons for quick navigation
   - Color coding for alert levels (e.g., green, yellow, red)

Sources to Include:

1. Official: 
   - Israel Home Front Command
   - Israel Defense Forces (IDF) official channels
   - Local municipality emergency services

2. News:
   - Israeli news outlets (e.g., Haaretz, The Jerusalem Post)
   - International news (e.g., Reuters, AP, BBC)

3. Social Media:
   - Twitter/X feeds from official government accounts
   - Curated lists of verified local journalists and news outlets

4. Weather:
   - Local weather services for potential impact on crisis situations

Remember to prioritize official, verified sources to prevent the spread of misinformation during crisis situations. Also, ensure the app is designed to be battery-efficient and works well on various screen sizes.

For implementation, consider using a cross-platform framework like React Native or Flutter to develop for both iOS and Android. This would allow you to reach a wider audience and maintain a single codebase.

Lastly, it's crucial to work closely with local authorities and emergency services to ensure the app complies with regulations and provides accurate, timely information.
