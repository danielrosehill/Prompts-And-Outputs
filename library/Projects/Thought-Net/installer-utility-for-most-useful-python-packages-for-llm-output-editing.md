*Note: this repository consists of the outputs of large language models (LLMs). In many cases, these are unedited or minimally edited. The information provided is for demonstrative purposes only and is intended to highlight constraints and capabilities in LLM applications and prompt engineering strategies.*


# Prompt

Great work!
I'm interested in avoiding or minimising the need to have to install Python packages as I run these outputs and say "hey that would be helpful"
I have an idea
Can you provide me with a list of the 50 most useful Python packages for the purpose of generating PDFs, manipulating LLM outputs in to different formats, etc. If you can come up with such a list, can you please generate an installer utility that will programatically install them onto my system?

# Output

Certainly! I'll provide you with a list of 50 useful Python packages for generating PDFs, manipulating LLM outputs, and related tasks. Then, I'll create a Python script that can install these packages for you.

Here's a list of 50 useful Python packages:

1. PyPDF2
2. reportlab
3. fpdf
4. pdfkit
5. WeasyPrint
6. xhtml2pdf
7. PyMuPDF
8. pdfrw
9. pdfminer.six
10. camelot-py
11. tabula-py
12. pdfplumber
13. PyPDF4
14. borb
15. pikepdf
16. pypdf
17. pdf2image
18. PyX
19. rst2pdf
20. markdown2pdf
21. pandas
22. numpy
23. matplotlib
24. seaborn
25. plotly
26. openpyxl
27. xlsxwriter
28. jinja2
29. pyyaml
30. toml
31. beautifulsoup4
32. lxml
33. requests
34. aiohttp
35. httpx
36. pillow
37. opencv-python
38. scikit-image
39. transformers
40. torch
41. tensorflow
42. keras
43. nltk
44. spacy
45. gensim
46. textblob
47. fitz
48. docx2pdf
49. python-docx
50. pypandoc

Now, here's a Python script that will install these packages for you:

```python
import subprocess
import sys

def install_packages(packages):
    for package in packages:
        try:
            subprocess.check_call([sys.executable, "-m", "pip", "install", package])
            print(f"Successfully installed {package}")
        except subprocess.CalledProcessError:
            print(f"Failed to install {package}")

packages = [
    "PyPDF2", "reportlab", "fpdf", "pdfkit", "WeasyPrint", "xhtml2pdf", "PyMuPDF",
    "pdfrw", "pdfminer.six", "camelot-py", "tabula-py", "pdfplumber", "PyPDF4",
    "borb", "pikepdf", "pypdf", "pdf2image", "PyX", "rst2pdf", "markdown2pdf",
    "pandas", "numpy", "matplotlib", "seaborn", "plotly", "openpyxl", "xlsxwriter",
    "jinja2", "pyyaml", "toml", "beautifulsoup4", "lxml", "requests", "aiohttp",
    "httpx", "pillow", "opencv-python", "scikit-image", "transformers", "torch",
    "tensorflow", "keras", "nltk", "spacy", "gensim", "textblob", "fitz",
    "docx2pdf", "python-docx", "pypandoc"
]

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Starting installation of packages...")
    install_packages(packages)
    print("Installation process completed.")
```

To use this script:

1. Save it as a Python file, e.g., `install_packages.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the script.
4. Run the script using Python:
   ```
   python install_packages.py
   ```

This script will attempt to install all the listed packages using pip. It will print the status of each installation.

Please note:
- Some packages may have dependencies or require additional system-level installations.
- You may need administrator privileges to install some packages.
- It's recommended to run this in a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with existing packages.
- The script doesn't check for existing installations, so it may attempt to reinstall packages you already have.

Always review the packages and their purposes before installing them to ensure they align with your specific needs and project requirements.
