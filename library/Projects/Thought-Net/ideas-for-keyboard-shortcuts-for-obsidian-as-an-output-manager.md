# Prompt

I'm currently using Obsidian to manage this system for storing prompts, outputs, and custom agent configurations. Based on the details described in the attachment, please suggest some keyboard shortcuts I could configure to make working with this tool as efficient as possible. I would like there to be one to: create a new prompt (jump to a template for a new prompt automatically saved to the prompts folder); edit prompts (jump to the drafts subfolder in prompts). Please suggest some others and tell me how I could configure these.

# Output

Based on the Output Hub project overview and Obsidian's keyboard shortcut capabilities, here are some suggested keyboard shortcuts to enhance your efficiency when working with the system:

## Suggested Keyboard Shortcuts

1. **Create New Prompt**
   Shortcut: `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux)
   Action: Create a new note from a template and save it to the Prompts folder

2. **Edit Prompts**
   Shortcut: `Cmd+Shift+E` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+E` (Windows/Linux)
   Action: Open the Drafts subfolder in the Prompts folder

3. **Open Output Management Module**
   Shortcut: `Cmd+Shift+O` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+O` (Windows/Linux)
   Action: Navigate to the Output Management Module

4. **Access Custom Agent Configurations**
   Shortcut: `Cmd+Shift+A` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+A` (Windows/Linux)
   Action: Open the Custom LLM Agent Configuration Module

5. **Open Contextual Repository**
   Shortcut: `Cmd+Shift+C` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+C` (Windows/Linux)
   Action: Navigate to the Contextual Repository Module

## Configuring Custom Shortcuts

To set up these custom shortcuts in Obsidian:

1. Open Obsidian Settings by pressing `Cmd+,` (Mac) or `Ctrl+,` (Windows/Linux).

2. In the left sidebar, click on "Hotkeys" under "Options"[2][3].

3. Use the search bar to find the specific command you want to assign a shortcut to.

4. Click the "+" icon next to the command.

5. Press the desired key combination for your new shortcut[2].

6. If the shortcut is already in use, it will turn red. In this case, you'll need to choose a different combination[2].

For actions that don't have existing commands, you may need to create them using the Obsidian API or community plugins. For example:

- To create a new prompt from a template, you could use the "Templater" plugin and assign a hotkey to a specific template[4].
- For navigating to specific folders, you could use the "Quick Switcher++" plugin to create commands for opening specific folders, then assign hotkeys to these commands[3].

Remember to choose shortcuts that are easy for you to remember and don't conflict with existing system or Obsidian shortcuts. You might consider using a "hyper key" setup for more complex shortcuts, as mentioned in some of the search results[4].

By implementing these shortcuts, you'll be able to navigate your Output Hub system more efficiently, allowing for quicker access to prompts, outputs, and configurations.
