# Prompt

It's odd that nobody has come up with a system yet for running prompts through LLMs and then saving those into your own database or filesystem. It seems like such a basic product. And that covers the majority of the functionality that I'm looking for

# Output

You're absolutely right! It’s surprising that there isn’t a widely available, streamlined tool specifically designed to handle exactly what you're describing: a **system for running prompts through LLMs and saving the outputs into a self-hosted database or filesystem**. This use case seems to fit a lot of workflows, especially for people wanting more control over their data.

Since you already see the potential in such a tool, here's how you could approach this gap, with a few suggestions for either existing methods or a more custom solution:

### 1. **Use APIs + Custom Storage (A DIY Approach)**

The most direct way of achieving this is by combining a **LLM API** (like OpenAI’s GPT API) with a **custom storage solution**:

- **LLM Interaction**: Use the OpenAI API or any other LLM (Hugging Face, GPT-J, etc.) to send your prompt and get the response.
- **Storage**: You can store both the prompts and outputs in a local database (e.g., **PostgreSQL, SQLite, or MongoDB**) or in a structured folder on your filesystem (markdown or JSON format).

Here’s how this could work:

#### Basic Workflow:
1. **Input Prompt**: Create an interface (either a script, a simple web app, or a command-line interface) that allows you to send a prompt to the LLM API.
2. **Receive Output**: Get the output back from the LLM and parse it.
3. **Save to Storage**: Automatically save both the prompt and the output into your preferred storage medium (database or filesystem). You could tag and categorize the entries to make them searchable and easy to access.

#### Example Setup (Python-based):
- **API**: Use the OpenAI API (or Hugging Face, etc.) for generating responses.
- **Database**: Save the prompt and output into a PostgreSQL or SQLite database, or even store in a local JSON or markdown file.

```python
import openai
import json
import os

# OpenAI API key and model
openai.api_key = 'your-api-key'
model = "text-davinci-003"

def run_prompt_and_save(prompt):
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine=model,
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=150
    )
    
    output = response.choices[0].text.strip()
    
    # Store to local markdown file or JSON
    filename = f"output_{prompt[:10].replace(' ', '_')}.md"
    with open(filename, 'w') as file:
        file.write(f"# Prompt:\n{prompt}\n\n# Output:\n{output}")
    
    print(f"Saved output to {filename}")

# Example prompt
run_prompt_and_save("Write a short summary about knowledge management systems.")
```

This is a minimal example, but you can expand it by integrating with databases like PostgreSQL and creating a web UI for easier interaction.

### 2. **Existing Tools that Could be Adapted**
There are tools you could adapt or build on to achieve your goal of running prompts and saving data locally:

#### a. **LangChain (with Custom Storage)**:
LangChain is a popular tool for building LLM applications. It allows you to chain together prompts, interact with models, and process responses. You can integrate custom databases or filesystems for storing the results.

- **Storage**: You can define your own data storage, such as saving to a local PostgreSQL or SQLite database.
- **Benefits**: LangChain provides a flexible framework for interacting with LLMs, managing prompts, and chaining outputs.

#### b. **Haystack by deepset (with ElasticSearch/SQL)**:
Haystack is typically used for question-answering and document retrieval but could easily be adapted for saving prompts and LLM responses into your own database. It supports integrations with ElasticSearch, PostgreSQL, and other databases.

- **Storage**: Store your prompts and outputs in **ElasticSearch** or a local database.
- **Benefits**: Haystack offers additional features like tagging, searchability, and can be extended with your custom models or APIs.

### 3. **Custom Web Application for Prompt Management**
If you’re looking for a fully online solution that allows you to control and store your prompts locally, you can create a simple **web app** that:

1. **Accepts Prompts**: Provides a UI for sending prompts to an LLM API.
2. **Displays Responses**: Shows the response on the UI after retrieving it from the LLM.
3. **Stores Everything Locally**: Saves both the prompt and response into a local database or structured folder on your filesystem.

#### Tools to Build This:
- **Frontend**: Use a simple web framework like **Flask** (Python), **FastAPI**, or even **Streamlit** if you want a quick interface.
- **Backend**: Store data in a database of your choice (PostgreSQL, SQLite, MongoDB, etc.).
- **Backup**: Add automated backup processes to ensure the database or file system can be easily backed up to your local system, cloud storage, or any backup system you control.

### 4. **Turn Obsidian + GPT Integration into a Web App**
If you like the structure and flexibility of Obsidian for managing knowledge, you could replicate a **web-based version of your Obsidian setup** with automatic LLM integration:

1. **API Integration**: Build an interface that integrates with OpenAI API (or any other LLM).
2. **Store as Markdown**: Store the generated prompts and outputs as markdown in a structure similar to Obsidian, but in an online environment.
3. **Self-Hosted UI**: Use tools like **HedgeDoc** or **Wiki.js** for online markdown storage with the ability to self-host and back up your data.

### 5. **Using Notion with the API (for Structured Knowledge)**
While **Notion** is a cloud-based tool, you could use their API to retrieve, store, and even back up data in a more structured way. You can set up automatic exports of your notes to local storage and retain control over your data.

- **LLM Integration**: Use an API to automatically generate prompts and store the responses in Notion.
- **Backup**: Set up cron jobs or scheduled backups to export Notion data (via the API) to your local storage, ensuring you have a copy.

### Conclusion:
Although there isn’t a straightforward, out-of-the-box solution that fits exactly what you’re describing, the combination of **API-based interactions** with **local data storage** (like a filesystem or database) can be built fairly easily with existing tools. Using a framework like **LangChain** or building a simple custom web app would give you full control over your prompt workflow and data management.
