# Prompt

Here's my current output. It looks like it's progressing nicely. Give me an ETA and what I should do when it says 100% / indicates the process was done. will that mean i have raid1 setup and running?

# Output

To provide an accurate ETA and confirm the steps to take when the process reaches 100%, I need to understand more about the current output and process. Could you let me know:

1. The current status or output details, such as the type of process you’re running (is it syncing, initializing, or something else?).
2. Any error messages or specific indicators that appear during the process.
3. If possible, the RAID configuration tool or platform you're using (e.g., mdadm on Linux).

Once the output reaches 100%, it should mean that the RAID1 setup is complete and operational, but there might be some additional checks or steps to confirm that it is working correctly.

# Prompt

Fedora workstation 40 with the disk array i shared previously (NVME + 2 x SSD )

# Output

Once the process reaches 100%, here’s what to do to confirm that RAID1 is fully set up and functioning:

1. **Verify RAID Status:**
   - Use the command `cat /proc/mdstat` to check the RAID status. You should see a message indicating that the RAID array is active, along with the devices assigned to it.

2. **Check RAID Health:**
   - Run `mdadm --detail /dev/mdX` (replace `/dev/mdX` with your RAID device, such as `/dev/md0`) to get detailed information about the RAID array. This will show you if both SSDs are functioning properly within the RAID1 setup.
   - You should see both drives listed as “active sync” under "State."

3. **Mount and Test:**
   - If the RAID array is set up to mount automatically, check `/etc/fstab` to confirm the configuration.
   - Manually mount the RAID array and confirm that you can read and write to it.
   
4. **Monitor Performance:**
   - If RAID1 setup and synchronization are completed without issues, your array is ready for use. You may wish to periodically monitor with `mdadm --detail` or `cat /proc/mdstat` to ensure ongoing health.

Let me know if you'd like more detailed commands or guidance on any of these steps.
