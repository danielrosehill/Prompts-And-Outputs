# Prompt

Please help me to develop a streamlined system for achieving the following: I would like to create some documentation repositories on Github that I can manage as Obsidian vaults. 

The following are repetitive actions that I would like to automate: 

1: I decide that there is something I would like to create a cohesive body of documentation about (right now: an updated repository outlining backup approaches in consumer SaaS)

2: I decide that I would like to create a public Github repository in order to share this documentation

3: I create the repository using Gitkraken and I clone it to my local computer

4: I then load Obsidian and add that folder as a vault so that I can create markdown content in Obsidian

5: After doing this, I can periodically push the vault to Github either using a plugin or in VS Code

Suggest how this process could be streamlined!

# Output

To streamline your workflow of creating documentation repositories managed as Obsidian vaults and pushed to GitHub, you can automate some of the repetitive actions using a combination of **Git tools**, **Obsidian plugins**, and **automation scripts**. Here's a plan for simplifying your process:

### Streamlined Workflow:

1. **Automate Repository Creation and Cloning**:
   - Instead of manually creating the repository through GitKraken and cloning it to your local machine, you can use a script to automate this process.
   - **GitHub CLI (`gh`)** allows you to create repositories directly from the command line, and you can integrate this into a script that will also clone the repository to your local machine.
   
   Example Script:
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   # Create a new GitHub repository and clone it locally

   read -p "Enter the name of your new GitHub repository: " repo_name

   # Create GitHub repo using gh CLI
   gh repo create "$repo_name" --public --clone

   # Navigate to the repository folder
   cd "$repo_name"

   # Open Obsidian with this folder as a vault
   open -a "Obsidian" .

   echo "Repository $repo_name created and opened in Obsidian!"
   ```

   - This script uses the GitHub CLI to create the repository, clones it, and then automatically opens it in Obsidian as a vault.
   - You can run the script anytime you decide to start a new documentation project.

2. **Using the Obsidian Git Plugin**:
   - Instead of manually pushing your changes via GitKraken or VS Code, use the **Obsidian Git plugin** to manage pushes and pulls directly within Obsidian.
   - Install the **Obsidian Git plugin** and configure it to automatically sync with GitHub based on your preferred schedule (e.g., every 10 minutes, or on every file change).
   - The plugin also provides a button for manual commits and pushes from within Obsidian, so you don’t need to leave your writing environment.

   **Obsidian Git Plugin Configuration**:
   - In Obsidian, go to **Settings > Community Plugins**, search for **Obsidian Git**, and install it.
   - Configure the plugin for automatic syncing:
     - Enable **Auto-pull interval** and set the desired pull frequency.
     - Enable **Auto-push interval** to automatically push your commits at a specified interval.
     - Set the default commit message template to something like: "Updated documentation: {{date}}"

3. **Streamline Periodic Documentation Updates**:
   - **VS Code** integration is useful for more complex edits (e.g., handling merge conflicts), but for simpler edits or quick documentation pushes, the Obsidian Git plugin eliminates the need to switch tools.
   - Set up an alias in Git or a small script to open the vault in both Obsidian and VS Code at once when needed:
   
   Example Script to Open in Obsidian and VS Code:
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   repo_dir=$1

   # Open the directory in Obsidian and VS Code simultaneously
   code "$repo_dir"
   open -a "Obsidian" "$repo_dir"

   echo "Opened $repo_dir in both Obsidian and VS Code."
   ```

   Run this script whenever you need to do heavy lifting in VS Code while still maintaining Obsidian for writing and documentation.

4. **Template for Consistency**:
   - Set up a **template** in Obsidian for new documentation. You can create a reusable markdown template that includes sections like **overview**, **instructions**, **use cases**, etc.
   - Use Obsidian’s **Templates plugin** to quickly insert pre-formatted markdown content when creating new files.

### Summary of the Streamlined System:

1. **Automated Repo Creation and Cloning**: Use the GitHub CLI to create and clone new documentation repositories in a single script.
2. **Obsidian Git Plugin**: Automatically manage Git commits and pushes without leaving Obsidian.
3. **Combined Editing**: Use a script to open repositories in both Obsidian and VS Code when needed for more complex edits.
4. **Templates**: Use Obsidian's Templates plugin for standardized documentation structure.

By following this setup, you'll automate the repetitive steps and manage your entire documentation process more efficiently.
