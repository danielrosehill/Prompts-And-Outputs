# Prompt

I own a small consulting business and currently manage expenses and receipts using Google Drive (an old Workspace account). I'm modernizing my systems and have a new Google Workspace account for email, but need additional tools. Ideally, I want a streamlined system for:

- Expense tracking and receipt capture (must have)
- Invoice generatio (must have)
- Client management (must have)
- Securely sharing financial data (read-only) with my accountant (who also uses Google Workspace).

It would also be great to get some functionalities like financial analysis, budgeting, and predictive analytics. Deep AI integration would be great.

Other preferences: provides users with the ability to backup their own data. Forward thinking and popular, especially among an SMB userbase.

Please recommend one tool at a time which you think matches this criteria. Then stop your output. When I say "next", "one more" or something like it, suggest one more tool. Do not repeat suggestions you've previously made. 

Here's the format to follow (interpret the markdown and repeat it in your output).
