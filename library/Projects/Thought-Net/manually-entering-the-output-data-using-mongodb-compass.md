# Prompt

I don't think that this is going to be something I can do with a script. Let's assume that I'm going to be doing this manually. Do you think it's possible to do something like this in MongoDB Compass? I'm also open to the idea of using something like Compass to manage the data temporarily. Do you think this approach is possible?

# Output

Yes, it's certainly possible to manage this data manually using MongoDB Compass, especially if you're dealing with a manageable amount of data or want to set up your initial structure before automating the process. MongoDB Compass provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with MongoDB databases, which can be helpful for this kind of task. Here's how you could approach this:

1. Set up Collections:
   In MongoDB Compass, create two collections: `prompts` and `outputs`.

2. Insert Documents:
   You can manually insert documents into these collections using Compass's interface. For each prompt and output, you'd create a new document.

3. Storing Markdown:
   The markdown content can be stored as a string in a field (e.g., `content`) within each document. Compass allows you to view and edit this content easily.

4. Creating Links:
   To create links between prompts and outputs:
   - In the `prompts` collection, you can have a field called `relatedOutputs` that's an array of ObjectIds.
   - In the `outputs` collection, you can have a field called `promptId` that's a single ObjectId.

5. Updating Links:
   When you create an output, you'd manually add its ObjectId to the corresponding prompt's `relatedOutputs` array, and set the output's `promptId` to the prompt's ObjectId.

Here's a step-by-step process you could follow in Compass:

1. Create a prompt document:
   ```json
   {
     "title": "Explain quantum computing",
     "content": "# Explain quantum computing\n\nProvide a brief explanation...",
     "createdAt": new Date(),
     "updatedAt": new Date(),
     "relatedOutputs": []
   }
   ```

2. Create an output document:
   ```json
   {
     "promptId": ObjectId("..."), // You'd paste the ObjectId of the prompt here
     "content": "# Quantum Computing Explained\n\nQuantum computing is...",
     "createdAt": new Date(),
     "updatedAt": new Date()
   }
   ```

3. Update the prompt document to include the output's ObjectId in its `relatedOutputs` array.

This manual approach using Compass can be a good way to:
- Set up your initial data structure
- Experiment with different document designs
- Manually curate a set of high-quality prompt-output pairs

Once you're comfortable with the structure and have a set of data to work with, you could then look into automating the process with a script that interacts with your MongoDB database directly.

Remember, while this manual approach is feasible, it can become time-consuming for large amounts of data. It's a good starting point, but for long-term use, especially with a growing dataset, you'd want to automate this process.
