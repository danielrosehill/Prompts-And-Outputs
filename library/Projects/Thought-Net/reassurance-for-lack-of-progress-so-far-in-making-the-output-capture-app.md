# Prompt

This makes me feel a lot better about the fact that I haven't managed to build this yet. I've been trying really hard to put together something like this for the past few months. I've definnitely picked up some skills and made progress, but I've been beating myself up for not succeeding at getting a workable version in place already. It's more work than I imagined!

# Output

I completely understand how you feel, and you definitely shouldn't be hard on yourself for not getting a workable version in place yet—what you're trying to build is genuinely a **complex project**, especially if you're doing it alone and learning as you go. Developing something that integrates multiple features like **AI-driven chat**, **context retrieval**, **database storage**, and **cross-platform compatibility** is **no small feat**. It requires not just understanding several different technologies but also the ability to **integrate them seamlessly**, which is often the hardest part.

### Why This is a Challenging Project
- **Multi-Disciplinary Skills Required**: To pull off a system like this, you need a mix of skills in **front-end development**, **back-end architecture**, **API integration**, **database management**, and even a bit of **UX design** to make the interface usable. Acquiring these skills takes time, and integrating them into one project requires even more practice.
  
- **AI Integration**: Interfacing with an AI like ChatGPT is not as straightforward as typical app features because you have to manage **prompt construction**, handle **response formats**, and possibly also process **contextual data** before it gets to the model. The complexity increases significantly if you want outputs to be informed by the stored context.
  
- **Data Management and Retrieval**: Designing a **searchable system** that provides rapid access to context snippets is essentially building a **knowledge management system** from scratch. It’s challenging because it has to be both efficient and intuitive. Building something that’s both powerful and easy to use takes a lot of iteration.

### Progress You've Made is Valuable
The progress you've made in picking up new skills and understanding the technologies involved is **invaluable**. Even if it hasn't led to a complete version yet, these are all stepping stones that are crucial to eventually realizing your vision. Developing a new skill set, even one technology at a time, is an investment in your future capability to build projects like this effectively.

### Tips to Keep Moving Forward
1. **Break Down Features**: Continue breaking down the project into the smallest possible components and work on them individually. Even creating a **basic storage and retrieval system** for prompts and outputs can be a small win.
  
2. **Simplify the MVP**: It might help to define an **even more minimal version** of your MVP. For example, instead of a fully integrated system, just getting a functional **database-backed prompt and output storage** with a working AI integration (without fancy context retrieval) could be a great milestone.

3. **Don’t Work in Isolation**: There’s a strong community of developers and enthusiasts working on similar projects. Consider sharing your progress in forums like **Reddit**, **Discord groups**, or even **GitHub**. Sometimes, seeing others’ challenges and solutions can make your path forward clearer.

4. **Leverage Existing Tools**: There are some great low-code tools that could help you offload some of the technical burdens. Even using something like **Airtable** for storing prompts and outputs, combined with a no-code interface like **Bubble**, could be an excellent way to get a prototype running.

### You’re Not Alone in Finding This Difficult
Many experienced developers would find a project like this challenging, particularly in **integrating disparate components** into a cohesive whole. Even seasoned teams at companies can take months to build similar systems. The fact that you've made progress and picked up relevant skills already puts you on a solid path forward.

The truth is that **integration work**, which forms the core of what you want to build, is often where the majority of development time is spent, and it's far more involved than just coding individual features. You’re not just building the components; you're building the way they **communicate** and **work together seamlessly**, which is inherently challenging.

Give yourself credit for what you’ve accomplished so far. You’re taking on something ambitious, and every new skill and understanding you've gained is bringing you closer to the goal. Progress in tech can be **iterative** and often slower than we'd like, but it accumulates into something great over time. Keep at it!
