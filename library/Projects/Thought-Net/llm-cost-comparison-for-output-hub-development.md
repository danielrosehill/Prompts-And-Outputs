*Note: this repository consists of the outputs of large language models (LLMs). In many cases, these are unedited or minimally edited. The information provided is for demonstrative purposes only and is intended to highlight constraints and capabilities in LLM applications and prompt engineering strategies.*


Certainly! I'll draft an initial prompt for creating your custom agent and then provide some thoughts on cost-effectiveness.





# Custom AI Agent Prompt Template for Frontend Development

You are an AI assistant specialized in frontend development, with deep knowledge of the following database schema:

[INSERT FULL DDL HERE]

Your task is to assist in creating a comprehensive CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) frontend for this database. You should be able to generate code, explain your decisions, and modify your output based on user requests.

Key requirements:
1. Use React for the frontend framework
2. Implement React Router for navigation
3. Use Axios for API calls
4. Style with Tailwind CSS
5. Ensure proper form validation and error handling
6. Create responsive designs suitable for both desktop and mobile
7. Follow best practices for accessibility (WCAG guidelines)
8. Implement user authentication and authorization where appropriate

When asked to generate code, please provide complete, functional components unless specified otherwise. Be prepared to explain your code and make modifications as requested.

Remember the following:
- The database schema represents the current data structure. Any frontend you create should be fully compatible with this schema.
- Consider relationships between tables when creating forms or displaying data.
- Provide clear comments in your code to explain complex logic or decisions.
- If any part of the schema or requirements is unclear, ask for clarification before proceeding.

Are you ready to begin frontend development based on this schema and requirements?


Now, regarding the cost-effectiveness of different LLMs for this project:

1. GPT-3.5 Turbo:
   - Most cost-effective option
   - Pricing: ~$0.002 per 1K tokens
   - Capable of handling most coding tasks, but may require more iterations

2. Claude 2 (via Anthropic):
   - Moderate pricing, exact costs not publicly available
   - Generally considered more cost-effective than GPT-4
   - Very capable for coding tasks and handling large contexts

3. GPT-4:
   - Most expensive option
   - Pricing: ~$0.03 per 1K prompt tokens, $0.06 per 1K completion tokens
   - Most powerful, but may be overkill for many tasks

4. CodeGen 16B or similar open-source models:
   - Potentially free if self-hosted
   - Requires technical expertise to set up and run
   - May not be as capable as commercial options for complex tasks

Considering the balance of cost and capability, I would recommend starting with GPT-3.5 Turbo. Here's why:

1. Cost-effective: It's significantly cheaper than GPT-4, allowing for more iterations and experimentation.
2. Capable: It can handle most coding tasks well, especially with a well-crafted prompt.
3. Fast: It typically has faster response times than GPT-4, allowing for quicker development cycles.
4. Scalable: You can always upgrade to GPT-4 for specific complex tasks if needed.

If you find that GPT-3.5 Turbo isn't quite meeting your needs, Claude 2 would be the next step up in terms of capability while still being more cost-effective than GPT-4.

To use this approach:

1. Start by using the prompt template I provided with GPT-3.5 Turbo.
2. Begin with generating basic components and overall structure.
3. Iterate and refine, providing feedback and additional context as needed.
4. If you encounter particularly complex parts of the frontend that GPT-3.5 Turbo struggles with, consider using GPT-4 or Claude 2 for just those specific components.

This strategy allows you to balance cost-effectiveness with the power you need for your project. Would you like to proceed with this approach, or do you need any clarification on the prompt or LLM recommendations?
