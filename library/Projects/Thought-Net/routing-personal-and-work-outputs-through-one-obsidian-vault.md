# Prompt

I'm using my current system for gathering knowledge for both personal and work uses. It's cumbersome to maintain two separate vaults. 

Do you have any thoughts for systems I could institute to route the work and personal outputs into separate folders so that I could show some to my boss without exposing my personal generations? I'm trying to think of a way to do this that won't slow down my workflow

# Output

To streamline your workflow while keeping **work** and **personal outputs** separated without managing two separate Obsidian vaults, you could implement a few organizational and automation techniques that route the outputs into **different folders** automatically. This would maintain efficiency and ensure privacy when showing work-related notes to your boss. Below are some approaches you could explore:

### 1. **Folder-Based Organization with Tagging and Automation**
   A simple way to keep your outputs separate is by using folder-based organization within the **same vault** but automating the process so you don't have to manually file each output.

#### Setup:
   - **Create Dedicated Folders**:
     - Inside your Obsidian vault, create two main folders:
       - `Work Outputs`
       - `Personal Outputs`
     - Subdivide them as necessary (e.g., by project or topic).

   - **Tagging Prompts**:
     - Before generating content with GPT, prepend each prompt with a simple tag or keyword (e.g., `#work` or `#personal`).
     - Alternatively, if your prompts or context are clearly distinguishable between personal and work contexts, you can rely on different patterns in your inputs to categorize them.

   - **Automation with Templates**:
     - Use Obsidian’s **Templater** plugin or a similar automation tool to insert specific metadata in each new note. For example, you could automate templates for work outputs to include `#work` tags and direct them to the work folder.
     - Create templates or snippets for each type of output generation (`Work` and `Personal`) that include pre-defined metadata or headers like:
       - Work template: `#work` (or metadata: `category: work`)
       - Personal template: `#personal`

#### Automation (Minimizing Manual Steps):
   - **File Management Plugins**: Obsidian plugins like **QuickAdd** or **Templater** can be used to automatically move notes into specific folders based on the presence of tags like `#work` or `#personal`.
     - Example Workflow:
       1. You generate the output and tag it with `#work` or `#personal` when saving it.
       2. The plugin scans for these tags and **automatically routes** the note to the corresponding folder.
     - This eliminates the need to manually organize every note and keeps the flow fast.

#### Plugins to Explore:
   - **Templater**: Lets you automate the insertion of tags and metadata into notes, making it easy to create workflows for different types of outputs.
   - **QuickAdd**: Adds commands to quickly categorize and sort notes based on specific criteria (e.g., tags).
   - **Dataview**: This plugin can help you filter and organize your notes based on custom metadata (e.g., work vs. personal) if you need more complex categorization.

### 2. **Use a Tag-Based Organization System**
   You can build a **tag-based system** where all notes are stored in the same vault, but tags determine whether a note is for work or personal use. You can still use folders, but tags will allow you to easily **filter and separate** notes without physically moving them between folders.

#### Setup:
   - **Tag Your Notes**: 
     - Every time you generate a new output, tag the note with `#work` or `#personal`.
   - **Use Saved Queries**: 
     - Use Obsidian’s built-in **search functionality** or **Dataview plugin** to create saved queries that filter and display only work or personal notes. This allows you to easily show your boss a filtered view of only the work-related notes, without physically separating everything into different vaults.

#### Example Workflow:
   - **Work Tag**: If a note contains `#work`, it will automatically be categorized as a work note. When showing notes to your boss, you can quickly filter by the tag `#work` and display only those notes.
   - **Saved Work Query**: You can set up a saved search in Obsidian (or use Dataview) to create a dynamic list that automatically displays only the notes tagged with `#work`. This way, you won’t have to manually search or worry about accidentally revealing personal notes.

   Example Query (Dataview):
   ```dataview
   table
   from "Outputs"
   where contains(tags, "work")
   ```

#### Benefits:
   - Allows you to keep a **single vault**.
   - Tag-based separation is easy to manage and doesn’t interrupt your workflow.
   - You can create dynamic filters, so you don’t have to worry about accidentally revealing personal notes.

### 3. **Automate Sorting Using GPT Output Context**
   Since your GPT outputs may be easily distinguishable based on content or the prompt you use, you could add **automated content sorting** based on the nature of the output itself.

#### Steps:
   - **Content Detection**:
     - If you typically generate different kinds of content for work and personal purposes (e.g., work involves more technical writing, while personal is more informal), you could set up a system that analyzes the text and routes it accordingly.
     - Use a tool like **Zapier** or **Make (formerly Integromat)** to analyze the text based on pre-defined keywords or phrases that determine whether the note should be categorized as work or personal.

   - **Automation Trigger**:
     - You could set up a workflow where Zapier or Make connects to your vault or a storage solution like B2. Whenever a new file is created, it checks the file for keywords or metadata (e.g., `category: work`), and routes the file to the appropriate folder automatically.

#### Example Trigger:
   - When a new markdown file is created:
     - If the file contains words like "client," "deadline," or "project," it automatically gets routed to the **Work Outputs** folder.
     - If it contains personal references, it gets routed to the **Personal Outputs** folder.

   This would reduce manual tagging and filing, though it requires initial setup for automation.

### 4. **Use a Dedicated Work Folder with Manual Review Before Syncing**
   If automating everything doesn’t fit your workflow, you can create a dedicated **Work Folder** that you only sync or share with your boss after manually reviewing and cleaning it.

#### Workflow:
   - **Generate and Save All Outputs in a Single Folder**: Continue saving all your outputs (both personal and work) into the same folder.
   - **Review and Move**: Periodically (once a day or week), review the outputs and move work-related ones into a **dedicated Work folder**.
   - **Sync or Show the Work Folder**: Only sync or share the **Work Outputs** folder with your boss. This ensures you can work quickly without thinking too much about where to file things, but you still maintain a clean separation when needed.

#### Benefits:
   - Minimal impact on your workflow since you're not forced to sort or tag every single output in real-time.
   - Manual review ensures accuracy, so no personal files are ever accidentally shared.

### Conclusion: A Combination of Tagging and Automation for Speed and Separation
To maintain efficiency while separating work and personal outputs, I recommend a combination of:
- **Tagging and Folder-Based Organization**: Use tags like `#work` and `#personal` to distinguish the outputs, and then use automation to route notes into the correct folders without manual effort.
- **Automation Plugins**: Leverage Obsidian plugins like **Templater** or **QuickAdd** to automatically insert tags or metadata and file notes accordingly.
- **Dynamic Filters**: Use Obsidian’s search functionality or the **Dataview plugin** to create filtered views of only work-related notes when showing them to your boss.

This solution should give you the organization you need without slowing down your workflow.
