# Prompt

Let's create another version of this idea.

As mentioned before, the first thing this script should do is recurse through all my Github projects. They're all in /home/daniel/Git but they're often nested. So it will need to recurse through the subfolders.

I have a few objectives:

1) I'd like to be able to quickly clone my repos on new hardware and use the current filestructure. I'm frequently reorganising my repositories, so it would be ideal if the script could be run incrementally and would be able to reflect small updates like repositories being moved into new subfolders.

2) I'd like to be able to use this script in order to "sync" my current github storage on my laptop which I use less frequently. Ie, I'd like to be able to run something on my laptop which will take the exact structure I have on my desktop and replicate it. You can assume that the Git folder on my laptop is ~/Git and it's running the same OS. So I would just need a way to replicate the structure. As this is a sync tool, you should expect that it would run repeatedly.
# Output


To meet the requirements you outlined, we can create a **two-part solution** that handles both the **incremental backup** and **syncing of the folder structure** between your desktop and laptop.

### Objectives:
1. **Incremental Backup Script**:
   - The script will recursively go through your `/home/daniel/Git` folder on your desktop, capturing the remote URLs of the repositories and the current directory structure.
   - This will allow you to move or reorganize repositories, and the script will reflect these changes incrementally.
   
2. **Sync Script**:
   - On your laptop, a sync script will read the backup file created by the desktop, compare it with the current structure on the laptop (`~/Git`), and adjust the structure by cloning or moving repositories to match the desktop.
   - The sync will only clone or move repositories that are missing or have been reorganized.

### Solution Breakdown:
1. **Backup Script** (Desktop): Creates an "imprint" of all local repositories and their remote URLs.
2. **Sync Script** (Laptop): Reads the imprint and synchronizes the Git folder structure between your desktop and laptop.

---

### **Part 1: Backup Script (Desktop)**

This script will capture the current state of your Git repositories on your desktop.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Base directory where your Git repositories are located
GIT_DIR="/home/daniel/Git"
SCRIPT_DIR="$(dirname "$0")"
BACKUP_DIR="$SCRIPT_DIR/../Backups"

# Create the backup directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p "$BACKUP_DIR"

# Get the current timestamp for the backup file
TIMESTAMP=$(date +"%d%m%y_%H%M")

# Define the backup file name
BACKUP_FILE="$BACKUP_DIR/${TIMESTAMP}_git_repos_structure.json"

# Initialize the backup file as a JSON object
echo "{ \"repos\": [" > "$BACKUP_FILE"

# Function to recursively find Git repos and write them to the backup file
function backup_repos() {
    echo "[INFO] Scanning for Git repositories in $GIT_DIR..."

    # Keep track of the number of repositories found
    local repo_count=0

    # Recursively find all .git directories
    find "$GIT_DIR" -type d -name ".git" | while read -r git_dir; do
        # Get the parent directory (repository directory)
        repo_dir=$(dirname "$git_dir")
        
        # Get the remote URL for the repo
        repo_url=$(git -C "$repo_dir" remote get-url origin 2>/dev/null)
        
        if [ -n "$repo_url" ]; then
            echo "[INFO] Found repo: $repo_dir"
            echo "[INFO] Remote URL: $repo_url"

            # Write the repo path and remote URL as a JSON object
            if [ $repo_count -ne 0 ]; then
                echo "," >> "$BACKUP_FILE"  # Add a comma to separate the objects
            fi
            echo "  { \"path\": \"$repo_dir\", \"remote_url\": \"$repo_url\" }" >> "$BACKUP_FILE"
            ((repo_count++))
        else
            echo "[WARNING] No remote URL found for repo at $repo_dir"
        fi
    done

    echo "[INFO] Total repositories backed up: $repo_count"
}

# Finalize the backup file
function finalize_backup() {
    echo "]}" >> "$BACKUP_FILE"
    echo "[INFO] Backup completed and saved to $BACKUP_FILE"
}

# Run the backup and finalize
backup_repos
finalize_backup
```

### **How it Works**:
1. **Recursively Find Git Repos**:
   - The script finds all `.git` directories in `/home/daniel/Git` and retrieves the remote URL for each repository.
   
2. **Create JSON Backup**:
   - The output is stored in a JSON file, which includes the local paths and remote URLs of each repository. This format is machine-readable and can easily be used by the sync script.

3. **Incremental**:
   - The backup file will always reflect the current structure. If you move repositories into new subfolders or add/remove repositories, the next backup will include these changes.

### **Output Example**:
```json
{
  "repos": [
    { "path": "/home/daniel/Git/project1", "remote_url": "git@github.com:danielrosehill/project1.git" },
    { "path": "/home/daniel/Git/subfolder/project2", "remote_url": "git@github.com:danielrosehill/project2.git" }
  ]
}
```

### **Running the Backup Script**:
1. **Ensure it’s executable**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x /path/to/Script/git_backup.sh
   ```

2. **Run the script**:
   ```bash
   ./git_backup.sh
   ```

### **Part 2: Sync Script (Laptop)**

This script will read the backup file generated by the desktop and synchronize the structure on the laptop.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Base directory where your Git repositories are located on the laptop
GIT_DIR="$HOME/Git"
BACKUP_FILE="$1"  # Pass the backup file as an argument

if [ -z "$BACKUP_FILE" ]; then
    echo "[ERROR] Please provide a path to the backup file."
    exit 1
fi

# Function to read the backup file and sync the repositories
function sync_repos() {
    echo "[INFO] Starting sync from backup file: $BACKUP_FILE"

    local repo_count=0
    local synced_repos=0

    # Parse the backup file and extract repo paths and URLs
    jq -c '.repos[]' "$BACKUP_FILE" | while read -r repo_info; do
        # Extract the local path and remote URL
        repo_path=$(echo "$repo_info" | jq -r '.path')
        repo_url=$(echo "$repo_info" | jq -r '.remote_url')

        # Determine the equivalent path on the laptop
        laptop_repo_path="${GIT_DIR}${repo_path#/home/daniel/Git}"

        # Check if the repo already exists in the laptop's Git directory
        if [ -d "$laptop_repo_path/.git" ]; then
            echo "[INFO] Repo already exists: $laptop_repo_path"
        else
            # Clone the repository into the correct folder
            echo "[INFO] Cloning repository: $repo_url to $laptop_repo_path"
            mkdir -p "$laptop_repo_path"
            if git clone "$repo_url" "$laptop_repo_path"; then
                echo "[INFO] Successfully cloned $repo_url"
                ((synced_repos++))
            else
                echo "[ERROR] Failed to clone $repo_url"
            fi
        fi

        ((repo_count++))
    done

    echo "[INFO] Sync completed. Total repos processed: $repo_count, new repos cloned: $synced_repos."
}

# Run the sync
sync_repos
```

### **How the Sync Script Works**:
1. **Reads Backup File**: The script reads the JSON backup file generated by the desktop.
2. **Syncs Repositories**:
   - It checks if each repository already exists on the laptop.
   - If a repository is missing, it clones the repository into the correct directory based on the structure provided in the backup.
3. **Incremental Sync**:
   - The script will run repeatedly without re-cloning existing repositories. It only clones the repositories that are missing or have been moved to a new location.

### **Running the Sync Script**:
1. **Ensure it’s executable**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x /path/to/Script/sync_git.sh
   ```

2. **Run the script**:
   Pass the backup file from your desktop to the script:
   ```bash
   ./sync_git.sh /path/to/Backups/ddmmyy_hhmm_git_repos_structure.json
   ```

### **Advantages**:
- **Reflects Folder Changes**: If you reorganize repositories, the next time the backup runs, it will capture the new structure and replicate it on your laptop.
- **Incremental**: The script only clones missing repositories, making it efficient when run repeatedly.
- **JSON Backup Format**: The JSON format allows for easy parsing and reuse of the repository structure, ensuring that the structure remains consistent across multiple machines.

### **Next Steps**:
- You can set these scripts to run automatically using **cron jobs** or manually whenever you need to sync your repositories between devices.
- If desired, you can extend the sync script to handle deletions (i.e., removing repos on the laptop that were removed from the desktop).
