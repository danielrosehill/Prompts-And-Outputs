Yes, you can generate the system spec on your LibreELEC device and send the output directly to your Fedora desktop (192.168.1.132) using **SCP (Secure Copy Protocol)**. Here's how you can do it:

1. First, generate the system spec on your LibreELEC device and save it to a file.
2. Use SCP to transfer the file to your desktop.

Here's the full process:

### 1. Run the command on LibreELEC to generate the system spec:
```bash
(dmesg && cat /proc/cpuinfo && cat /proc/meminfo && df -h && lsusb && ifconfig && uname -a) > /storage/libreelec_system_specs.txt
```

This saves the file as `libreelec_system_specs.txt` in the `/storage` directory.

### 2. Transfer the file to your desktop using SCP:
From the **LibreELEC** system, run:
```bash
scp /storage/libreelec_system_specs.txt user@192.168.1.132:/home/user/Desktop/
```

Replace `user` with your Fedora username, and this will copy the file to the **Desktop** folder on your Fedora system at `192.168.1.132`.

### 3. Authentication:
If this is the first time you're connecting via SCP, it will ask you for the password of the Fedora machine's user account.

Once completed, you will find the file on your Fedora desktop.
