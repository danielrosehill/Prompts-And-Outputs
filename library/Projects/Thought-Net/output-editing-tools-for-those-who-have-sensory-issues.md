You’re looking for display configuration tools or monitors aimed at those sensitive to screen brightness or experiencing sensory overload. There are indeed tools and techniques that can help adjust screens to more comfortable settings, and some monitors come with built-in features to reduce strain. Here’s a breakdown of solutions tailored for your needs:

### 1. **Monitors with Built-in Features for Eye Comfort**
Look for monitors that have special modes to reduce eye strain:
- **Flicker-Free Technology**: Some monitors come with flicker-free technology to eliminate screen flickering at all brightness levels. This can greatly reduce eye strain and sensory overload.
- **Low Blue Light**: Many modern monitors, including models from BenQ, ASUS, and Dell, have modes specifically designed to reduce blue light emissions, which can be harsh on the eyes.
- **Matte Screens**: Monitors with matte finishes reduce glare and reflections, making screens more comfortable to look at.

Consider models like the **BenQ GW2480** or **ASUS Eye Care series**, both of which include flicker-free and low blue light features.

### 2. **Software Tools to Reduce Brightness and Sensory Overload**

#### **1. Redshift**
- Redshift adjusts your screen's color temperature based on time and location, giving it a warmer tone at night, which reduces blue light and brightness. While it is mainly for night use, it can be configured to keep the screen dimmer all day.
  - Install on Fedora:
    ```
    sudo dnf install redshift
    ```
  - You can configure it for constant dimming with:
    ```
    redshift -O 3000K -b 0.8
    ```
  - This will set the screen temperature to a warmer 3000K and reduce the brightness by 20%.

#### **2. GNOME Night Light**
- If you're using the GNOME desktop, it has a built-in **Night Light** feature that reduces blue light and makes the screen softer. It's not available by default in KDE Plasma, but it can be manually enabled.
  - To enable:
    - Open **Settings** → **Displays** → Enable **Night Light** and adjust the intensity.

#### **3. Brightness Controller**
- Brightness Controller is a tool that helps reduce the overall brightness beyond what the hardware allows, perfect for those needing to dim screens more than the default settings.
  - Install on Fedora:
    ```
    sudo dnf install brightness-controller
    ```

#### **4. Gamma Correction Tools**
- You can also adjust the gamma of your display, which affects the overall brightness and contrast, helping reduce brightness intensity:
    ```
    xrandr --output <display_name> --gamma 0.8:0.8:0.8 --brightness 0.7
    ```
  - The gamma settings allow fine-tuning of brightness and contrast beyond typical monitor settings.

### 3. **E-Ink Monitors**
For extreme sensitivity, **e-ink monitors** can be a game-changer. They use a completely different technology that is much softer on the eyes, similar to Kindle displays:
- **Dasung Paperlike E-Ink Monitor**: This is a grayscale e-ink monitor designed for those who need to avoid backlit displays altogether. It’s suitable for working in text-based environments, though it may not be ideal for graphics-heavy tasks.

### 4. **Glare Reducing Monitor Filters**
You can also use **glare-reducing screen filters**:
- **3M Anti-Glare Filters**: These are clip-on or stick-on filters that reduce screen brightness and reflections, making the screen more comfortable without software adjustments.

### 5. **Custom Desktop Environments and Accessibility Tools**
- **KDE Plasma** (which you're using on Fedora) allows for granular control of your display configuration, brightness, and gamma. You can access these options through **System Settings** → **Display and Monitor** → **Night Color**.
  
Additionally, you can explore accessibility settings within **KDE Plasma** or **GNOME** for further adjustments to UI elements like contrast and color to make screens more comfortable.

By combining these software tools and hardware solutions, you can create a screen environment that is comfortable and minimizes sensory overload. Let me know if you'd like assistance with any of the configurations!
