*Note: this repository consists of the outputs of large language models (LLMs). In many cases, these are unedited or minimally edited. The information provided is for demonstrative purposes only and is intended to highlight constraints and capabilities in LLM applications and prompt engineering strategies.*


# Prompts

'I'm currently collecting ChatGPT outputs in a repository of markdown files that I populate with Obsidian. The collection is scaling quickly - it's currently at about 4K notes and is growing at about 1K notes/2 weeks. Some of the outputs are unlikely to be of interest to most. But a few demonstrate some (I think) fascinating LLM use-cases, especially those that are emerging, and some prompt engineering strategies I experiment with (or invent). I would love to begin publishing some of them (lightly edited) on a blog - to share with other LLM enthusiasts. I've picked up a domain (danielgoesprompting.com). I'd love some help in speccing out the workflow. 

For one, I'd like to come up with some kind of "pipeline". Perhaps once a day, I'd like to "pull" my output vault into a separate repo for the blog. This repo wouldn't be shared publicly. In addition to pulling in the outputs, it would group them into folders with ddmm structure so that I could easily sort through the outputs from a particular day. The sync process should only sync new items onace. If they were deleted in the blog repo, they shouldn't be repopulated. 

I'd like to create the simplest publishing process possible. Ideally, I'd just move a markdown file into a folder in the publishing repo and it would be published. Maybe frontmatter could be added manually, programatically, or both. The blog would be published through the Github repo and built on a server as a static site. 

Can you suggest a workflow?

# Outputs



It sounds like you have a clear vision for how you want to share your ChatGPT explorations, and I love how systematic you are about developing this pipeline! Here's a potential workflow that might meet your needs for simplicity and efficiency while keeping the control you'd like over the publishing process.

### Workflow for Publishing ChatGPT Outputs

1. **Create a Daily Sync Script**

   - **Syncing from Obsidian Vault**: Set up a script (e.g., in Python) that runs daily to "pull" new markdown notes from your Obsidian output vault to the blog repository. This can be done using a simple filesystem copy process or using `rsync` for efficiency. You can include metadata to track synced files to ensure that only new files are added during each run.
   - **Organize by Date**: During the sync, structure the copied notes into folders with the format `ddmm` (day-month). This will make it easy to see which notes came from a particular day and can simplify organization.
   - **Track Synced Items**: To avoid duplicates and unnecessary re-syncs, create a `.synced` file or list in the blog repository that keeps a record of all notes already transferred. This way, the sync script can check if a file has already been processed and skip it if necessary.

2. **One-Way Syncing with File Deletion Rules**

   - The syncing script should have a **one-way sync** mode. New markdown files are copied over, but files that have been deleted from the blog repository aren't re-added, allowing you to curate freely.
   - To achieve this, mark each note once it has been transferred. If a file is deleted in the blog repo, its metadata can be retained to prevent it from being re-imported. A simple text database or even a JSON file could handle this efficiently.

3. **Setting Up Frontmatter**

   - To prepare notes for publication, **frontmatter** should be added. This can be done programmatically during the sync process or manually once you're ready to publish a specific output.
   - You could add a script that scans for any missing frontmatter and automatically populates basic metadata like `title`, `date`, `tags`, and any other information that you commonly use. This could help streamline the manual effort required while still giving you editorial flexibility.

4. **Publishing Workflow**

   - **Publishing Repo**: Create a separate repository where notes ready for publishing are stored. This repo will be private but can be connected to your web server for automatic deployment.
   - The **publishing process** should be as simple as moving a markdown file into a specific folder in this publishing repository. For example, if you move a file to the `/ready-to-publish` folder, it will be picked up by your build script for deployment.
   - Consider using **GitHub Actions** or another automation tool to trigger a rebuild of the static site every time you make a change to this folder, making publishing nearly automatic.

5. **Static Site Generation and Deployment**

   - Use a **static site generator** like **Jekyll**, **Hugo**, or **Eleventy** to convert your markdown files into HTML for publishing on the web. All of these tools work well with GitHub and can be set up to rebuild your blog automatically on commit.
   - Set up **Cloudflare Pages** for deployment. Cloudflare Pages integrates seamlessly with GitHub, enabling automatic deployment with minimal effort. You can connect `danielgoesprompting.com` as a custom domain for a polished final product.

6. **Optional Enhancements**

   - **Review Queue**: You might want to create a `review` folder within your publishing repo, where notes can sit until you've given them a final edit. Once approved, you can move them to the `ready-to-publish` folder.
   - **Lightweight CMS**: If you'd like a slightly more dynamic publishing setup without adding too much complexity, you could consider integrating a lightweight headless CMS like **Netlify CMS**. This would let you manage the content more visually, still keeping markdown as the core format.

### Summary Workflow Diagram

1. **Daily Sync Script** pulls new notes to a separate blog repository ➔ Notes organized by `ddmm`.
2. **One-Way Sync** with `.synced` record prevents duplicate imports.
3. **Frontmatter added** programmatically or manually.
4. Move markdown files to `ready-to-publish` folder for **automatic publishing**.
5. Static site generated via **Jekyll/Hugo/Eleventy** ➔ Deployed to **Cloudflare Pages**.

Does this workflow capture what you had in mind? I'm happy to refine or dive deeper into any of these steps if you'd like more detail or examples!
