Prompt: "I would like to devise a system for storing prompt outputs in a file/knowledge management system which supports the following functionalities: the user fills out an input form with three fields: title, prompt, output. The form parses this information. The prompt is saved into a prompt library folder. The output is saved into a prompt output folder. And the title is used to name the file in the output folder. The output file includes a link to the prompt and vice versa. All these documents are created automatically after the user completes the form. I am open to self-hosting or using cloud technology so long as I can retain a backup of the data with the links preserved. Can you think of any technologies that might meet this need?"

Here are some technologies that could meet your requirements for a file/knowledge management system to store prompt outputs, with the ability to self-host or use cloud technology while ensuring data backups with links preserved:

### 1. **Nextcloud with Forms and Markdown Editor**
   - **Why It Works:**
     - **Self-Hosting**: Nextcloud is a self-hosted cloud storage and file management system that you can run on your server or choose to host with a provider.
     - **Forms**: You can use the Nextcloud Forms app to create the input form for collecting the title, prompt, and output.
     - **File Management**: Nextcloud’s file management capabilities allow you to organize your files into folders (Prompt Library and Prompt Outputs).
     - **Markdown Editor**: You can use the Markdown Editor to store prompt and output files with links to each other.
     - **Backup**: Nextcloud supports automated backups, ensuring your data, including links, are preserved.

   **How to Set It Up:**
   - Set up Nextcloud and install the Forms app.
   - Create a form that captures the title, prompt, and output.
   - Use a script or automation tool (e.g., Flow in Nextcloud) to parse the form data and create markdown files in the appropriate folders with the necessary links.
   - Set up a regular backup system within Nextcloud to ensure all data and links are preserved.

### 2. **Obsidian with GitHub Backup**
   - **Why It Works:**
     - **Local First**: Obsidian works as a local-first knowledge management system, storing files as Markdown, which is easily backed up.
     - **Plugins**: Use the Templater plugin to create an input form and Dataview for organizing and linking prompt and output notes automatically.
     - **Self-Hosting with GitHub**: You can set up a GitHub repository to back up your entire Obsidian vault, preserving all links and data.
     - **Backup**: Automated GitHub actions or other scripts can ensure regular backups.

   **How to Set It Up:**
   - Create templates in Obsidian with the Templater plugin for storing prompts and outputs.
   - Use Dataview queries to automatically link files.
   - Set up a GitHub repository for your Obsidian vault and configure it to push updates regularly, preserving all links.

### 3. **Dendron (VSCode Extension) with Git Backup**
   - **Why It Works:**
     - **Scalable Knowledge Management**: Dendron is a hierarchical note-taking system that works within VSCode and stores notes in Markdown files.
     - **Customization**: You can customize the note templates and automation scripts to parse the input form data and link notes.
     - **Git Integration**: Since Dendron is a VSCode extension, you can easily use Git for version control and backups.
     - **Backup**: Regular Git commits and backups will preserve the hierarchical structure and links between files.

   **How to Set It Up:**
   - Install Dendron in VSCode and set up your workspace with separate hierarchies for prompts and outputs.
   - Create custom note templates that include links between prompts and outputs.
   - Use Git for version control, ensuring regular backups.

### 4. **TiddlyWiki**
   - **Why It Works:**
     - **Single-File Wiki**: TiddlyWiki is a highly customizable wiki that can be hosted locally or on a server and stores all data in a single HTML file.
     - **Customization**: You can create forms, templates, and macros to automate the creation of links and file organization.
     - **Backup**: TiddlyWiki can be easily backed up as a single file, and all internal links are preserved within that file.

   **How to Set It Up:**
   - Customize TiddlyWiki with input forms for collecting prompt data.
   - Use macros to automate the creation of linked entries in your library and output sections.
   - Regularly back up the TiddlyWiki file to ensure all data and links are preserved.

### 5. **Zettlr with Git Backup**
   - **Why It Works:**
     - **Markdown-Based**: Zettlr is an open-source Markdown editor designed for knowledge management, supporting Zettelkasten-style note-taking.
     - **Custom Fields**: You can define custom fields in your Markdown notes for prompts and outputs, and link them accordingly.
     - **Backup**: Zettlr integrates well with Git for backups, preserving all links and data.

   **How to Set It Up:**
   - Set up Zettlr with custom templates for storing prompt and output data.
   - Use Git for version control and backup of your Zettlr notes, ensuring all links between notes are preserved.

### 6. **Logseq with Git Backup**
   - **Why It Works:**
     - **Graph-Based Knowledge Management**: Logseq is a local-first, graph-based knowledge management system that supports Markdown and Org-mode.
     - **Linking and Templates**: It allows you to easily create templates and automatic links between prompts and outputs.
     - **Backup**: Since Logseq uses plain text files, you can back up your entire graph using Git, preserving all links.

   **How to Set It Up:**
   - Use Logseq’s templates to set up your prompt and output folders.
   - Create backlinks between prompts and outputs using Logseq’s internal linking system.
   - Set up Git for regular backups of your Logseq graph.

These solutions offer varying levels of customization, ease of use, and backup capabilities. Nextcloud, Obsidian with GitHub, and Logseq with Git backup provide robust options for managing, linking, and preserving your data.
