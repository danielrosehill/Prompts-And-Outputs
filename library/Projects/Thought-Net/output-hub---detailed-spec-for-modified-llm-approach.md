*Note: this repository consists of the outputs of large language models (LLMs). In many cases, these are unedited or minimally edited. The information provided is for demonstrative purposes only and is intended to highlight constraints and capabilities in LLM applications and prompt engineering strategies.*


# Prompt

Please enhance this specification:

Let's spec out a revised development plan for creating an application called Output Hub. I'll call it OH as a shortcut.

This application is going to be a powerful internal tool (CRUD) intended to provide a comprehensive means of storing some key data related to working with large language models, namely:

- Prompts
- Outputs
- Custom agent configurations

It will be backed by a Postgres database. 

Users will save and edit their prompts in OH. And when they're ready, they'll be able to push a button that says "Generate Output". When that happens, Output Hub will send the prompt to an LLM API (let's assume OpenAI) and return it as a saved output.

The database will be configured so that the prompt and the output it generates will be automatically related. This logic will be handled automatically by the app, of course.

In addition to these core features, users will be able to register custom LLM agents. This will involve saving some configuration parameters. But users will also be able to relate agents to prompts and outputs. That is to say, users will be able to "tag" an output as having been generated by a specific agent in their inventory.

One additional functionality will be the ability to assign tags to all three modules (agents, prompts, outputs). This will allow the user to be able to filter for outputs that are related to a common topic. 

The core interfaces of the app will be for creating and editing prompts, reading and editing outputs (there will be fields for the 'raw' output as sent back by the LLM API and an 'edited output' after human editing). There will also be screens for viewing and editing prompts. And for viewing and editing agent configurations. 

There will also need to be a screen for saving the user's OpenAI API key as that will be required for the backend operations.

Please think about this detailed spec and provide suggestions for developing the admin frontend. Please provide detailed step by step instructions to begin the project with a view to creating an MVP.

# Output

Certainly! I'll reorganize and enhance the specification for your Output Hub (OH) project. Here's an improved version with better structure and additional details:

## Output Hub (OH) Specification

### Project Overview

Output Hub (OH) is a powerful internal CRUD application designed to store and manage key data related to working with large language models. The primary components include:

1. Prompts
2. Outputs
3. Custom agent configurations

The application will be backed by a PostgreSQL database and will interact with OpenAI's API for generating outputs.

### Core Features

#### 1. Prompt Management

- Create, read, update, and delete prompts
- Save and edit prompts within the application
- Relate prompts to their generated outputs automatically

#### 2. Output Generation and Management

- Generate outputs by sending prompts to OpenAI's API
- Store raw outputs as received from the API
- Provide an interface for human editing of outputs
- Automatically relate outputs to their source prompts

#### 3. Custom Agent Configuration

- Register and manage custom LLM agents
- Save configuration parameters for each agent
- Relate agents to prompts and outputs (tagging system)

#### 4. Tagging System

- Assign tags to prompts, outputs, and agents
- Filter content based on tags for easy organization and retrieval

#### 5. User Authentication and API Key Management

- Secure user authentication system
- Store and manage user's OpenAI API keys for backend operations

### Database Design

- Implement a PostgreSQL database to store all data
- Design tables for prompts, outputs, agents, tags, and users
- Establish relationships between tables (e.g., prompts to outputs, agents to outputs)

### User Interface

#### Main Screens

1. **Prompt Management**
   - List view of all prompts
   - Create/Edit prompt interface
   - Prompt details view

2. **Output Management**
   - List view of all outputs
   - Output details view with raw and edited versions
   - Edit interface for outputs

3. **Agent Configuration**
   - List view of all custom agents
   - Create/Edit agent interface
   - Agent details view

4. **Tag Management**
   - Interface to create and manage tags
   - Tag assignment interface for prompts, outputs, and agents

5. **User Settings**
   - OpenAI API key management
   - User profile settings

#### Additional UI Elements

- Navigation menu for easy access to all main screens
- Search functionality across prompts, outputs, and agents
- Filtering system using tags
- "Generate Output" button on prompt screens

### Backend Functionality

- RESTful API to handle CRUD operations for all data types
- Integration with OpenAI API for output generation
- Automatic relationship management between prompts and outputs
- Secure handling and storage of user API keys

### Security Considerations

- Implement secure user authentication and authorization
- Encrypt sensitive data, especially API keys
- Ensure proper input validation and sanitization

## Development Plan for MVP

1. **Project Setup**
   - Initialize a new project repository
   - Set up the development environment (Node.js, React, PostgreSQL)
   - Create a basic project structure

2. **Database Design and Setup**
   - Design the database schema
   - Set up PostgreSQL database
   - Create necessary tables and relationships

3. **Backend Development**
   - Implement RESTful API endpoints for CRUD operations
   - Set up OpenAI API integration
   - Implement user authentication and authorization

4. **Frontend Development**
   - Create basic UI components (forms, lists, buttons)
   - Implement main screens (Prompt, Output, Agent management)
   - Develop user authentication interface

5. **Core Functionality Implementation**
   - Develop prompt creation and editing functionality
   - Implement output generation and storage
   - Create basic agent configuration system

6. **Integration and Testing**
   - Connect frontend with backend API
   - Implement error handling and validation
   - Conduct thorough testing of all features

7. **UI/UX Refinement**
   - Enhance user interface design
   - Implement responsive design for various screen sizes
   - Add loading indicators and error messages

8. **Documentation and Deployment**
   - Write user documentation
   - Prepare deployment instructions
   - Deploy MVP to a staging environment

9. **Security Audit and Optimization**
   - Conduct a security audit
   - Optimize database queries and API calls
   - Implement any necessary security enhancements

10. **Final Testing and Launch**
    - Perform end-to-end testing
    - Fix any remaining bugs or issues
    - Deploy the MVP to production

This enhanced specification provides a more structured and detailed outline for your Output Hub project. It includes a clear project overview, detailed core features, database design considerations, user interface specifications, backend functionality requirements, security considerations, and a step-by-step development plan for creating an MVP. This should give you a solid foundation to start building your application[1].
