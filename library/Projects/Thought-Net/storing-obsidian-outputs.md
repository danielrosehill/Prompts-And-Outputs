# Prompt

I would like to store my obsidian vault on a scalable cloud storage location. Can I store contents on a GCP bucket or in B2? And if so how?

# Output

Yes, you can store your Obsidian vault on a scalable cloud storage service like Google Cloud Platform (GCP) or Backblaze B2. Here’s how you can set it up for each option:

### 1. **Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Bucket**

**a. Setting up GCP Bucket:**
1. **Create a GCP Bucket:**
   - Go to the Google Cloud Console.
   - Navigate to the "Cloud Storage" section.
   - Click on "Create Bucket."
   - Choose a globally unique name for your bucket and select the appropriate settings like location, storage class, etc.

2. **Install gsutil (Optional):**
   - If you want to interact with your bucket from the command line, install the `gsutil` tool, which is part of the Google Cloud SDK.
   - You can install it on your local machine and configure it by running `gcloud init`.

3. **Syncing your Obsidian Vault:**
   - You can manually upload files via the GCP Console interface.
   - Alternatively, use `gsutil` for syncing:
     ```bash
     gsutil rsync -r /path/to/your/obsidian/vault gs://your-bucket-name
     ```
   - This command will sync your local Obsidian vault with your GCP bucket.

4. **Automate Syncing (Optional):**
   - You can automate this process using a cron job or a task scheduler on your operating system to periodically run the `gsutil rsync` command.

### 2. **Backblaze B2**

**a. Setting up B2:**
1. **Create a B2 Bucket:**
   - Sign in to your Backblaze account and create a B2 bucket.
   - Make sure to note your Application Key ID and Application Key, as you’ll need these for authentication.

2. **Install B2 Command-Line Tool:**
   - Install the Backblaze B2 command-line tool:
     ```bash
     pip install b2
     ```
   - Configure the tool with your account:
     ```bash
     b2 authorize-account <ApplicationKeyID> <ApplicationKey>
     ```

3. **Syncing your Obsidian Vault:**
   - Use the B2 command-line tool to sync your vault:
     ```bash
     b2 sync /path/to/your/obsidian/vault b2://your-bucket-name
     ```
   - This will upload your vault to the B2 bucket.

4. **Automate Syncing (Optional):**
   - As with GCP, you can automate the syncing process using a cron job or task scheduler.

### Considerations
- **Latency:** Keep in mind that cloud storage is not as fast as local storage. You may notice some latency when accessing files directly from the cloud.
- **Backup:** It's always a good idea to keep a local backup of your vault in addition to storing it in the cloud.

By following these steps, you can effectively store and manage your Obsidian vault in a scalable cloud storage solution like GCP or Backblaze B2.## Extracted Prompts
