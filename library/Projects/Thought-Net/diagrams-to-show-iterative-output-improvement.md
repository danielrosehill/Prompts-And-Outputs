# Prompt

Great. 
Please create a few codeblocks for diagrams that focus on how outputs are managed in the system

Outputs are either received from an API call or inputted by the user
Metadata like tags and follow up notes are added by the user
The output is stored
The output is reviewed
The output is improved upon
The output is actioned
The output is retained in the knowledge base

# Output

Certainly! I'll create a few Mermaid diagram codeblocks that focus on how outputs are managed in the Output Hub system, based on the workflow you've described. Here are the diagrams:

1. Output Creation and Initial Processing:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Output Source] -->|API Call| B[Receive Output]
    A -->|User Input| B
    B --> C[Add Metadata]
    C --> D[Add Tags]
    C --> E[Add Follow-up Notes]
    D --> F[Store Output]
    E --> F
    F --> G[Knowledge Base]
```

2. Output Lifecycle:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Stored Output] --> B[Review]
    B --> C[Improve]
    C --> D[Action]
    D --> E[Retain in Knowledge Base]
    E --> F[Future Reference]
    F -.-> B
```

3. Output Management Process:

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Received
    Received --> Tagged
    Tagged --> Stored
    Stored --> UnderReview
    UnderReview --> NeedsImprovement
    UnderReview --> ReadyForAction
    NeedsImprovement --> Improved
    Improved --> UnderReview
    ReadyForAction --> Actioned
    Actioned --> RetainedInKnowledgeBase
    RetainedInKnowledgeBase --> [*]
```

4. User Interaction with Outputs:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant System
    participant KnowledgeBase

    User->>System: Input Output / Trigger API Call
    System->>System: Process Output
    User->>System: Add Metadata (Tags, Notes)
    System->>KnowledgeBase: Store Output
    User->>System: Review Output
    User->>System: Improve Output
    System->>KnowledgeBase: Update Output
    User->>System: Action Output
    System->>KnowledgeBase: Mark as Actioned
    KnowledgeBase->>User: Provide for Future Reference
```

These diagrams illustrate the output management process in the Output Hub system, showing:

1. How outputs are created and initially processed, including metadata addition.
2. The lifecycle of an output from storage to retention in the knowledge base.
3. The various states an output can be in throughout its lifecycle.
4. The user's interaction with the system in managing outputs.

These visualizations should help users understand how outputs are handled, processed, and utilized within the Output Hub system, emphasizing the workflow from creation to retention in the knowledge base.
