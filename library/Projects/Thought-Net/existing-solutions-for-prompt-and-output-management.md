# Prompt
As you know I'm looking for a system to streamline my LLM interactions and ensure that they are saved in a logical manner. Specifically I'd like my prompts and outputs to both be saved in a database and linked. I'm wondering if there are existing solutions which interface with LLMs by an API (or by any means) and which allow users to configure a storage destination database for both their prompt and the output of that prompt ... and to link the two together. Do any existing solutions do this?

# Output
Yes, there are existing solutions that allow users to interface with LLMs via an API and configure a storage destination database for both their prompts and the corresponding outputs, ensuring they are linked together. Here are some options that meet your criteria:

1. **LangChain**:
   - **Description**: LangChain is a robust framework for developing applications powered by LLMs. It is designed to connect LLMs with other data sources and manage complex workflows.
   - **Storage Integration**: LangChain allows users to configure storage for prompts and outputs in various databases, including SQL, NoSQL, and cloud-based storage solutions. It also supports linking prompts and outputs together in a structured manner.
   - **API Interaction**: LangChain interacts with LLMs via API, providing a seamless way to manage and store data.

2. **Pinecone**:
   - **Description**: Pinecone is a vector database designed for AI and machine learning applications, including LLMs.
   - **Storage Integration**: While Pinecone primarily handles vector data, it can be combined with a traditional database or used alongside another system to store and link prompts and outputs.
   - **API Interaction**: Pinecone offers an API for integration with various LLMs and can be used to store and query data efficiently.

3. **NocoDB**:
   - **Description**: NocoDB is an open-source platform that turns databases into smart spreadsheets. It supports relational databases and can be customized to store and link LLM prompts and outputs.
   - **Storage Integration**: Users can configure NocoDB to store prompts and outputs in various relational databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.) and ensure they are linked together.
   - **API Interaction**: NocoDB can interact with LLMs through APIs, allowing for streamlined storage and management of data.

4. **PromptFlow (Microsoft Azure)**:
   - **Description**: Microsoft Azure's PromptFlow is designed to manage prompts and outputs for LLMs, providing tools for versioning, storage, and analysis.
   - **Storage Integration**: It integrates with Azure's data storage solutions, allowing users to store prompts and outputs in linked tables within SQL databases or other storage formats.
   - **API Interaction**: PromptFlow can be configured to interact with LLMs via API and automatically save and link prompts and outputs.

5. **Custom Solutions Using Zapier or Make (Integromat)**:
   - **Description**: Platforms like Zapier and Make allow users to build custom workflows that connect LLM APIs with storage solutions.
   - **Storage Integration**: Users can configure these platforms to store data in Google Sheets, Airtable, or SQL databases, ensuring that prompts and outputs are linked.
   - **API Interaction**: These tools allow for flexible API integrations with LLMs, automating the process of saving and linking prompts and outputs.

6. **Chroma**:
   - **Description**: Chroma is an open-source embedding database, particularly suitable for storing LLM prompts and outputs.
   - **Storage Integration**: It allows users to store and manage linked data in a database that supports embedding storage.
   - **API Interaction**: Chroma can interact with LLMs via APIs and provides tools to manage and retrieve linked data effectively.

These solutions vary in complexity and capabilities, but each can be configured to meet your requirements of storing prompts and outputs in a linked, logical manner in a database.## Extracted Prompts
