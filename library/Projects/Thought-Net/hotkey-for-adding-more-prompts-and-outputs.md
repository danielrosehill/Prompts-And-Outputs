# Prompt

Great. One more Obsidian request

I would like to have a hotkey that simply inputs this (input header, output header, blank line)

Can you think of a good hotkey to assign to this and how do I set it up?
# Output

Certainly! I can help you set up a hotkey to input those two headers with a line break between them in Obsidian. Here's how you can do it:

1. First, let's choose a hotkey. A good option might be `Ctrl+Shift+I` (for "Input/Output"). This combination is not commonly used in Obsidian by default, but you should check if it's already assigned to another command in your setup.

2. To set this up, you'll use the "Hotkeys" feature in Obsidian settings. Here's how:

   a. Open Obsidian Settings (gear icon in the left sidebar or use `Ctrl+,`).
   b. Go to "Hotkeys" in the left sidebar.
   c. In the search bar at the top, type "Templates: Insert template".
   d. Click the "+" button next to this command.
   e. Press the key combination you want to use (in this case, `Ctrl+Shift+I`).

3. Now, you need to create a template with the desired content:

   a. Go to Settings > Templates.
   b. Set a folder for your templates if you haven't already.
   c. Create a new file in this folder (let's call it "input_output.md").
   d. In this file, add the following content:

   ```markdown
   # Input

   # Output
   ```

4. Finally, go back to the Hotkeys settings and search for "Templates: Insert input_output". You should see your newly created template. Assign the same hotkey (`Ctrl+Shift+I`) to this command.

Now, whenever you press `Ctrl+Shift+I` in a note, Obsidian will insert your "Input/Output" template with the two h1 headers and a line break between them.

This method uses Obsidian's built-in templating system, which is simple and effective for this purpose. If you need more advanced templating features, you might consider using the Templater plugin, which offers additional functionality.## Extracted Prompts
