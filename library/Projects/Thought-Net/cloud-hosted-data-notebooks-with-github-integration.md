# Prompt

I'm leaning in favor of a cloud hosted solution. The requirements remain the same: I would like something that can integrate with Github so that I can work on my repositories. I'd like to be able to store my Python scripts for reuse. And I'd like to be able to back up this cloud environment. Please suggest a few options in addition to Collab. For each, provide pricing.

# Output

Here are a few **cloud-hosted solutions** that meet your requirements of integrating with GitHub, allowing you to store and reuse Python scripts, and offering backup options. Each solution provides a cloud-based environment for working with data, storing scripts, and integrating with version control systems like GitHub.

### 1. **Amazon SageMaker Studio Lab**
   - **Overview**: Amazon SageMaker Studio Lab is a free cloud-based JupyterLab environment that allows you to build and train machine learning models, write and reuse Python scripts, and store projects. It integrates with GitHub and provides up to 12 hours of runtime per session.
