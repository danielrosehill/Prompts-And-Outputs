If you want to engage **freelance resources** to help with your project, you'll need to find developers with specific skill sets, divided between **frontend** and **backend** tools and technologies. Here's a breakdown of what tools are relevant to your stack and the skills freelancers should have:

---

### **Frontend Tools and Skills**

1. **React (or Vue.js)**
   - **Description**: You’ll be using either React or Vue.js for building the frontend interface. Both are popular JavaScript frameworks for creating dynamic, single-page applications (SPAs).
   - **Skills to look for**: 
     - Experience with **React.js** (including hooks) or **Vue.js**.
     - Familiarity with state management libraries: **Redux** (for React) or **Vuex** (for Vue).
     - Knowledge of component-based design and using modern JavaScript (ES6+).

2. **TipTap Editor**
   - **Description**: This is a rich-text editor that supports markdown. It’s used to handle the input and formatting of knowledge notes in the frontend.
   - **Skills to look for**: 
     - Experience with **TipTap Editor** or similar rich-text/markdown editors.
     - Ability to integrate the editor with data management and handle customization (e.g., adding buttons, toolbar options).

3. **Material-UI (for React) or Vuetify (for Vue.js)**
   - **Description**: These libraries provide pre-built UI components like buttons, tables, and grids, based on the Material Design language.
   - **Skills to look for**:
     - Knowledge of **Material-UI** for React or **Vuetify** for Vue.js.
     - Experience creating responsive, accessible UIs using pre-built components and custom styling.

4. **Frontend Routing**
   - **Description**: React Router or Vue Router will be used to manage navigation between different views (e.g., list of notes, note detail, note editor).
   - **Skills to look for**:
     - Experience with **React Router** (for React) or **Vue Router** (for Vue) to handle routing, route guards, and dynamic route parameters.

5. **Axios or Fetch API**
   - **Description**: These libraries are used to handle API requests (fetching, posting, and updating data) between the frontend and backend.
   - **Skills to look for**:
     - Experience with **Axios** or the native **Fetch API** for making HTTP requests and handling responses.

6. **Frontend State Management**
   - **Description**: Managing state between components, such as for data persistence across different parts of the app, particularly with forms and API calls.
   - **Skills to look for**:
     - **Redux** (for React) or **Vuex** (for Vue) for complex state management.

7. **Testing (Optional)**
   - **Description**: Tools like **Jest**, **React Testing Library**, or **Cypress** can be used for unit and integration testing in the frontend.
   - **Skills to look for**:
     - Experience with writing tests using **Jest** or **React Testing Library** (for React) or **Vue Test Utils** (for Vue).

### **Backend Tools and Skills**

1. **FastAPI (Python) or Express.js (Node.js)**
   - **Description**: The backend will handle API requests and responses, managing CRUD operations for knowledge notes, and connecting the frontend to MongoDB and ElasticSearch.
   - **Skills to look for**:
     - For **FastAPI**:
       - Experience with Python and the **FastAPI** framework for building APIs.
       - Understanding of **Pydantic** (data validation) and asynchronous programming.
     - For **Express.js**:
       - Experience with Node.js and the **Express.js** framework.
       - Knowledge of middleware, API routing, and session management.

2. **MongoDB**
   - **Description**: MongoDB will serve as the main database for storing knowledge notes and metadata.
   - **Skills to look for**:
     - Experience with **MongoDB** for database management.
     - Ability to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations using MongoDB.
     - Familiarity with **Mongoose** (if using Express.js) or **Motor** (if using FastAPI) for object-document mapping (ODM).

3. **ElasticSearch**
   - **Description**: ElasticSearch will be used for fast, full-text search functionality across the knowledge base. The backend will need to integrate MongoDB data with ElasticSearch.
   - **Skills to look for**:
     - Experience with **ElasticSearch** for full-text search, indexing, and querying.
     - Knowledge of setting up and maintaining ElasticSearch indices.
     - Integration of ElasticSearch with backend APIs for handling search requests.

4. **Authentication (OAuth, JWT)**
   - **Description**: OAuth 2.0 or JWT (JSON Web Tokens) will be used for authentication and securing the API. This is essential for making the knowledge base private.
   - **Skills to look for**:
     - Experience implementing **OAuth 2.0** or **JWT** for API authentication and authorization.
     - Knowledge of handling secure tokens and role-based access control (RBAC).

5. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) (Optional)**
   - **Description**: Adding an extra layer of security via two-factor authentication (2FA) for user logins.
   - **Skills to look for**:
     - Familiarity with 2FA tools like **Google Authenticator**, **TOTP**, or libraries like **speakeasy** (Node.js) or **pyotp** (Python).

6. **Database Security and API Protection**
   - **Description**: Ensuring the backend API and database are secured against common attacks (e.g., SQL injection, XSS, brute force).
   - **Skills to look for**:
     - Knowledge of securing **MongoDB** (access controls, user roles).
     - Experience with **Express.js** or **FastAPI** security best practices (e.g., CORS, CSRF, input validation).
     - Using **Helmet.js** or similar tools for securing Express apps, or FastAPI’s security features.

7. **Testing (Optional)**
   - **Description**: Tools like **Pytest** (for Python) or **Mocha/Chai** (for Node.js) can be used for unit and integration testing.
   - **Skills to look for**:
     - Experience writing and running backend tests, including for API endpoints.

### **Optional Skills for Full-Stack Development**

If you’re looking for full-stack developers, you may want to seek those with a **combination** of the following skills:
- **Frontend and Backend Integration**: Ability to connect the frontend to the backend using Axios or Fetch, ensuring seamless API communication.
- **Deployment Experience**: Familiarity with deploying full-stack apps using **Docker**, **Heroku**, **AWS**, or **DigitalOcean**.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Setting up **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)** pipelines for automated testing, deployment, and scaling.
