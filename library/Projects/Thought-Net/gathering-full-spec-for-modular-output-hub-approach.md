*Note: this repository consists of the outputs of large language models (LLMs). In many cases, these are unedited or minimally edited. The information provided is for demonstrative purposes only and is intended to highlight constraints and capabilities in LLM applications and prompt engineering strategies.*


# Prompt

Great. Add in the other parts of the puzzle too. Users will want to be able to review previous conversations saved in the database. And they may wish to edit the raw outputs into human edited form. Please repeat that excellent outputs while integrating those additional elements. And include estimate as to development effort.

# Output

To fully flesh out the custom application, incorporating features like **reviewing previous conversations** and **editing the raw outputs** into human-edited form, here’s a more comprehensive approach. This version will include those elements and provide a rough estimate of development effort for each part.

### 1. **Core Components**

#### A. **Frontend (Conversational Interface + Review/Edit Mode)**
   - **Purpose**: The user-facing interface will serve three main functions:
     - Engage in real-time conversations with GPT-4.
     - Review previous conversations saved in the Postgres database.
     - Edit raw LLM outputs into a human-edited format.
   - **Options**:
     - **Gradio** or **Streamlit**: Still excellent for rapid development, offering built-in UI components for viewing, editing, and reviewing. If more customization is required, a **React** or **Vue.js** frontend would offer more control.
   - **Features**:
     - **Conversational Interface**: Display prompt input and LLM responses in real-time.
     - **Review Mode**: A table or list view that allows users to see past conversations stored in Postgres. Each record can be clicked to view the full conversation.
     - **Edit Mode**: Allows users to edit GPT-4's raw responses. Changes should be saved back into the database alongside the original version.
   - **Tech Stack**: 
     - For a more **advanced UI** with rich text editing and review capabilities, you may want to move to a **React-based interface** using libraries like **Draft.js** for the editing portion.

#### B. **Backend (LLM Integration + Data Management)**
   - **Purpose**: Handle communication with GPT-4 and manage user data and session persistence. Also responsible for saving edits made to conversations.
   - **Options**:
     - **FastAPI** or **Flask** for lightweight and fast API management.
     - **Django** (with REST Framework) for a more structured and robust system, particularly useful if the project may grow into a more complex application.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Integrate with **GPT-4’s API** to send and receive prompts and outputs.
     - Save conversation data (prompt, raw outputs, human-edited outputs) into **Postgres**.
     - Route user edits back into the database, storing both **raw** and **edited** versions of responses.
     - Handle session data for retrieving and displaying previous conversations.

#### C. **Database (Postgres)**
   - **Purpose**: Store conversation data, including both raw and human-edited responses.
   - **Schema**:
     - **Conversations Table**: Stores metadata about each conversation (user ID, timestamp, session ID).
     - **Prompts Table**: Stores each user prompt, linked to the conversation ID.
     - **Responses Table**: Stores the **raw response** from the LLM and an **editable response field** where human-edited versions can be saved.
     - **Files Table**: Stores URLs to files returned by GPT-4, linked to the conversation ID.
   - **How to Integrate**:
     - Use **SQLAlchemy** (Flask/FastAPI) or **Django ORM** to manage database operations.
     - Ensure that the human-edited field in the Responses table is optional, allowing it to be filled later after review and editing.

#### D. **Object Storage (S3)**
   - **Purpose**: Handle any files generated by the LLM or uploaded by the user.
   - **How It Works**:
     - Use **boto3** to upload files to **S3** and generate **URLs** to store in the database.
     - If users need to review or download files, the links are served directly from S3.
     - Handle user file uploads in real-time, with a process for saving and linking them to the corresponding conversation.

### 2. **Expanded Workflow**

#### **Step 1: Conversational Input & Output**
   - Users interact with the app’s conversational interface. They input prompts, and the backend sends them to GPT-4.
   - The backend receives the response from GPT-4 and:
     - Saves the **prompt** and **raw response** into **Postgres**.
     - If there’s an attached file, it’s uploaded to **S3** and the file URL is saved in the **Files Table**.
   - The frontend displays the response in real-time.

#### **Step 2: Reviewing Previous Conversations**
   - Users can enter a **Review Mode** where they see a list of previous conversations (retrieved from Postgres).
   - Selecting a conversation displays all prompts and responses (both raw and edited versions if applicable).
   - Users can download any attached files via URLs linked from the S3 bucket.

#### **Step 3: Editing LLM Outputs**
   - In **Edit Mode**, the raw LLM response is loaded into an editable text box (e.g., a WYSIWYG editor using **Draft.js** or **Quill** in React).
   - Users can modify the text and save the **human-edited version**.
   - When saved, the **edited response** is updated in the **Responses Table** under a separate column, while the original **raw response** remains intact for auditing.

#### **Step 4: Save and Log**
   - After editing, the backend updates the database, saving both the **raw** and **human-edited** responses.
   - Any subsequent interactions are similarly captured, and conversation logs are maintained for future review or analysis.

### 3. **Connecting the Pieces with Additional Features**

#### A. **Frontend Enhancements**:
   - Add a **conversation history panel** to display past interactions (with filters like date range or search functionality).
   - Implement an **editor interface** where raw responses can be edited, previewed, and saved.
   - Ensure smooth **navigation** between conversation modes (real-time interaction, review, edit).

#### B. **Backend Enhancements**:
   - Add API routes for:
     - Fetching **conversation history**.
     - Retrieving and saving **edited responses**.
     - Handling **file uploads** and **downloads** from S3.
   - Add **session management** to track ongoing conversations, allowing users to return to a conversation and pick up where they left off.

#### C. **Data Enhancements**:
   - Implement a system for logging **user edits** and keeping track of which parts of the response were edited.
   - Enable **version control** on edits, allowing users to revert to the original version if needed.

#### D. **Security & Authentication**:
   - Implement **authentication** (OAuth, JWT) to ensure only authorized users can access or edit conversations.
   - Use **encryption** for sensitive conversation data if necessary.
