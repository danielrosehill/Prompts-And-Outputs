# Prompt

I'm currently using Obsidian to keep my own copy of interactions with systems like Claude and ChatGPT. I currently engage with the systems via the web UI and then copy and paste into Obsidian. I use a notation like "Prompt 1", "output 1" to log the interaction. Can you think of any way that I can do this more intelligently? I've been thinking about two approaches. One is using some kind of RPA - my desktop is Fedora Linux. The second is configuring shortcut keys on my keyboard for "prompt" and "output" and finding some way in Obsidian to autoincrement the headings --- so that I only need to type the shortcut key and it will automatically assign the number. Which would be easier to set up? Can you show me how?

Both approaches you've mentioned are interesting, and each has its merits. Let's explore both options and then I'll provide some guidance on setting up the easier one.

1. RPA (Robotic Process Automation) Approach:
This could be powerful but might be more complex to set up. You'd need to find an RPA tool compatible with Fedora Linux, such as Autokey or xdotool. These tools could be programmed to:
- Copy text from the web UI
- Switch to Obsidian
- Paste the text
- Add the appropriate heading

While powerful, this approach requires more initial setup and programming.

2. Keyboard Shortcuts with Auto-incrementing Headers:
This approach is simpler and can be achieved within Obsidian itself using its built-in features and community plugins. This would be easier to set up and maintain.

Let's go with the second approach as it's more straightforward and doesn't require additional software. Here's how you can set it up:

1. Install the "Hotkeys++" plugin in Obsidian:
   - Go to Settings -> Community plugins
   - Browse and search for "Hotkeys++"
   - Install and enable the plugin

2. Set up the auto-incrementing headers:
   - Go to Settings -> Hotkeys
   - Search for "Hotkeys++: Insert heading with auto-incremented number"
   - Assign your desired shortcut keys (e.g., Ctrl+Shift+1 for Prompt, Ctrl+Shift+2 for Output)

3. Configure the plugin:
   - Go to Settings -> Hotkeys++ Options
   - In the "Headings to increment" field, add:
     ```
     Prompt
     Output
     ```

Now, when you press Ctrl+Shift+1, it will insert "## Prompt 1" and increment for each subsequent use. Similarly, Ctrl+Shift+2 will insert and increment "## Output 1".

To use this setup:

1. Open your Obsidian note
2. Press Ctrl+Shift+1 to insert "## Prompt 1"
3. Type or paste your prompt
4. Press Ctrl+Shift+2 to insert "## Output 1"
5. Copy and paste the AI's response

This method is easier to set up and maintain compared to the RPA approach. It keeps everything within Obsidian and doesn't require external tools or scripts.

If you'd like to explore the RPA approach or need more details on setting up the Obsidian method, let me know, and I'd be happy to provide more information.## Extracted Prompts
