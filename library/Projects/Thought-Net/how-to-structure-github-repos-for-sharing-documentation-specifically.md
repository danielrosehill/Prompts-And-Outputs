To structure a GitHub repository for sharing documentation, consider the following layout:

### Suggested Structure:
```
my-docs-repo/
│
├── README.md             # Overview and purpose of the documentation
├── docs/                 # Main documentation folder
│   ├── getting-started/  # Initial setup guides
│   ├── features/         # Detailed features descriptions
│   ├── tutorials/        # How-to guides and tutorials
│   └── api/              # API documentation (if applicable)
│
├── examples/             # Code or configuration examples
│
├── assets/               # Images, diagrams, or other media
│
└── LICENSE               # License information
```

### Key Points:
- **README.md**: Clearly define the purpose and how to navigate the repository.
- **Modular Documentation**: Use subdirectories for organization based on topics.
- **Version Control**: Track changes to documentation effectively.

This structure promotes clarity and ease of access for users.
