# Prompt
Great. As you know I use Fedora Linux. Let's think about the best way to configure these shortcuts there. Does it make the most sense to set up the shortcuts as Obsidian Hotkeys or perhaps integrate them into the whole OS? You let me know, and provide some ideas!

# Output
Excellent question! Given that you're using Fedora Linux, we have some interesting options for setting up these shortcuts. Let's explore the pros and cons of configuring them within Obsidian versus integrating them into the OS level.





# Shortcut Configuration Options for Fedora Linux

## 1. Obsidian Hotkeys

Pros:
- Directly integrated with Obsidian features
- Easy to set up within Obsidian's settings
- Portable across different operating systems if you use Obsidian on multiple devices

Cons:
- Only work when Obsidian is in focus
- Limited to Obsidian's built-in commands or those provided by plugins

## 2. OS-Level Shortcuts (Using GNOME Settings)

Pros:
- Work system-wide, even when Obsidian isn't in focus
- Can trigger complex actions or scripts
- Consistent across all applications

Cons:
- Require more setup
- May conflict with existing system or application shortcuts

## 3. Hybrid Approach (Recommended)

Use a combination of Obsidian hotkeys and OS-level shortcuts for maximum flexibility:

1. Obsidian-specific actions: Configure within Obsidian
2. System-wide actions: Set up using GNOME Settings
3. Complex workflows: Use AutoKey for advanced scripting

## Implementation Steps for Hybrid Approach

1. Obsidian Hotkeys:
   - Open Obsidian Settings > Hotkeys
   - Set up shortcuts for Obsidian-specific actions (e.g., create new note, insert template)

2. GNOME Custom Shortcuts:
   - Open Settings > Keyboard > View and Customize Shortcuts
   - Add Custom Shortcuts for actions like launching Obsidian or specific scripts

3. AutoKey for Advanced Automation:
   - Install AutoKey: `sudo dnf install autokey-gtk`
   - Create scripts for complex actions (e.g., formatting text, inserting timestamps)
   - Assign hotkeys to these scripts



Based on this analysis, I recommend a hybrid approach for your Fedora Linux setup. This allows you to leverage the strengths of both Obsidian's built-in functionality and the flexibility of OS-level shortcuts. Here's how you can implement this:

1. Obsidian-Specific Shortcuts:
   Configure these directly in Obsidian:
   - Ctrl + Alt + P: Create new prompt note
   - Ctrl + Alt + O: Create new output note
   - Ctrl + Shift + 1: Insert prompt template
   - Ctrl + Shift + 2: Insert output template
   - Ctrl + Alt + T: Quick tag insertion

2. OS-Level Shortcuts (Using GNOME Settings):
   Set these up in GNOME Settings for system-wide access:
   - Ctrl + Alt + Shift + O: Launch Obsidian
   - Ctrl + Alt + Shift + N: Open a new Obsidian note (using a custom script)

3. AutoKey for Advanced Automation:
   Use AutoKey for more complex actions:
   - Ctrl + Alt + A: Insert current date/time stamp
   - Ctrl + Alt + M: Insert metadata template
   - Ctrl + Alt + H: Highlight selected text (works in any application)

Here's how to set up each component:

1. Obsidian Hotkeys:
   - Open Obsidian and go to Settings > Hotkeys
   - Search for each command and assign the desired shortcut

2. GNOME Custom Shortcuts:
   - Open Settings > Keyboard > View and Customize Shortcuts
   - Scroll to Custom Shortcuts and click '+'
   - Name: "Launch Obsidian", Command: "flatpak run md.obsidian.Obsidian" (adjust if needed), Shortcut: Ctrl + Alt + Shift + O

3. AutoKey Setup:
   - Install AutoKey: `sudo dnf install autokey-gtk`
   - Launch AutoKey and create a new script for each action
   - Example script for inserting timestamp:
     ```python
     import datetime
     keyboard.send_keys(datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"))
     ```
   - Assign a hotkey to each script in AutoKey

Benefits of this hybrid approach:
1. Obsidian-specific actions remain within Obsidian for consistency
2. System-wide shortcuts allow you to quickly access Obsidian from anywhere
3. AutoKey provides powerful scripting capabilities for complex actions

Tips for implementation:
1. Start with a few essential shortcuts and gradually add more
2. Create a document in Obsidian listing all your custom shortcuts for easy reference
3. Regularly review and adjust your shortcuts based on usage patterns
4. Be mindful of potential conflicts with existing system or application shortcuts
