*Note: this repository consists of the outputs of large language models (LLMs). In many cases, these are unedited or minimally edited. The information provided is for demonstrative purposes only and is intended to highlight constraints and capabilities in LLM applications and prompt engineering strategies.*


Hereâ€™s a **Tech Specification Document** based on our discussion to help you park the idea and come back to it when you're ready to continue the project:

# **Tech Spec for Knowledge Base Project Using LLM Outputs**

### **Project Overview**
The goal of this project is to create a **knowledge base** that stores and organizes LLM-generated outputs, both for personal and professional use. The core functionality involves storing prompts, outputs, and associated metadata (e.g., tags, timestamps) in a structured way to allow for easy search and retrieval. The knowledge base should give the user a **competitive advantage** by providing an easily searchable repository of solutions, research, or references derived from LLM interactions.

### **Target Audience**
- Solo users looking to store and access LLM outputs for personal productivity.
- Professionals who want to leverage LLMs to solve work-related problems by building a knowledge repository.

## **Tech Stack**
The stack is chosen to support scalability, fast searching, real-time markdown editing, and authentication.

### **Frontend**
- **Framework**: React.js (or Vue.js as an alternative)
- **Rich Text/Markdown Editor**: TipTap
  - Provides WYSIWYG markdown editing capabilities.
  - Instant rendering of markdown content, suitable for handling LLM outputs.
- **UI Library**: Material-UI (for React) or Vuetify (for Vue.js)
  - Pre-built UI components for list views, tables, forms, etc.
  
### **Backend**
- **Framework**: FastAPI (Python) or Express.js (Node.js)
  - FastAPI provides asynchronous capabilities with Python, which can be useful for handling I/O tasks like interacting with databases.
  - Express.js offers flexibility for Node.js developers and integrates well with MongoDB.
- **Database**: MongoDB
  - Non-relational, document-based database suited to store structured data with varying fields (e.g., prompts, outputs, tags).
  - Schema flexibility is ideal for handling different components of LLM conversations.
  
### **Search Engine**
- **ElasticSearch**: 
  - Provides full-text search capabilities for efficiently querying large sets of data. 
  - Allows users to search within prompts, outputs, and metadata (e.g., tags).
  
### **Authentication**
- **OAuth 2.0** or **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**:
  - OAuth for external login (e.g., Google, GitHub) and JWT for token-based authentication.
  - Secure access and user-specific knowledge storage.
  
### **Additional Tools**
- **Docker**:
  - To containerize the frontend, backend, and database services, ensuring consistency between local and remote environments.
- **GitHub** (or GitLab):
  - Source code management, with integration into CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.

## **Features**

### **Core Features**
1. **Note Creation**:
   - Create a new note with a prompt and associated output.
   - Edit the note using TipTap editor, with instant markdown rendering.
   
2. **Note Viewing**:
   - Display a list of stored knowledge notes, organized by **tags** or **date**.
   - Filter and search notes by title, tags, or full-text search across prompts and outputs.
   
3. **Note Editing**:
   - Open an existing note, modify the prompt or output, and save changes back into the database.

4. **Search Functionality**:
   - Use ElasticSearch to search across the database for specific terms within prompts, outputs, or metadata (tags).
   - Support for full-text search queries like `"Paris AND capital"` to locate specific notes.

5. **Tagging System**:
   - Assign multiple tags to each note to facilitate categorization and filtering.
   
6. **Versioning (Optional)**:
   - Maintain a version history of notes for auditing or reviewing changes over time.

### **Additional Features**
- **Organized Lists**: Group notes by category (tags) and allow sorting by date or relevance.
- **Authentication**: Users must log in to access their personal knowledge base. Users can have personalized repositories or share notes within teams.

## **System Architecture**

### **Frontend-Backend Communication**
- The frontend interacts with the backend via **RESTful APIs**. These APIs handle the CRUD operations for storing, updating, and retrieving notes.
  
### **Database Schema**
**Conversations** are stored in MongoDB, where each document represents a full conversation or session with multiple prompts and outputs.

#### **Sample Schema**:
```json
{
  "conversation_id": "unique_id",
  "createdAt": "2024-10-22T10:00:00Z",
  "tags": ["AI", "knowledge"],
  "prompts": [
    {
      "prompt_id": "prompt_1",
      "text": "What is the capital of France?",
      "timestamp": "2024-10-22T10:01:00Z"
    }
  ],
  "outputs": [
    {
      "output_id": "output_1",
      "text": "The capital of France is Paris.",
      "prompt_id": "prompt_1",
      "timestamp": "2024-10-22T10:02:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

### **Search Indexing**
- **ElasticSearch** will index the contents of each conversation (prompts, outputs, tags) for fast retrieval.
  - An index will be created for each field (`prompts.text`, `outputs.text`, `tags`) for full-text search.
  - Users can filter results by tags or date as part of the search functionality.

---

## **Development Workflow**

### **1. Backend Development**
- Set up **MongoDB** and design the schema for storing conversations.
- Build out API endpoints using **FastAPI** (or Express.js) to manage CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete notes).
- Integrate **ElasticSearch** with MongoDB to ensure full-text search indexing works as expected.
- Set up authentication using **OAuth 2.0** or JWT.

### **2. Frontend Development**
- Build out the UI using **React** or **Vue.js**, with **TipTap** as the editor component.
- Create routes for listing notes, editing/creating notes, and searching the knowledge base.
- Implement integration with the backend API for handling note retrieval, creation, editing, and search.

### **3. Testing and Deployment**
- Use **Docker** to containerize both the frontend and backend. This ensures consistency between local environments and production.
- Set up **CI/CD pipelines** with GitHub (or another version control system) to automate testing and deployment.
- Provision **staging and production environments** in a cloud platform (AWS, Heroku, or DigitalOcean).

## **Development Priorities (MVP Focus)**

### **High Priority**:
1. **Backend**: Build out the CRUD API for storing and retrieving notes.
2. **Frontend**: Implement the core UI and integration with the markdown editor (TipTap).
3. **Search**: Set up basic search functionality using ElasticSearch.
4. **Authentication**: Implement OAuth 2.0 or JWT for user authentication.

### **Medium Priority**:
1. **Tagging System**: Allow users to categorize notes by tags.
2. **List View**: Add the ability to filter and sort notes by tags or date.
   
### **Low Priority (Future Enhancements)**:
1. **Versioning**: Implement a system for version control of notes.
2. **Two-Factor Authentication**: Add an extra layer of security.
3. **Shared Repositories**: Allow users to share notes within teams.

---

## **Future Enhancements and Scalability Considerations**
- **Data Scalability**: MongoDB and ElasticSearch can handle large volumes of data, but as the user base grows, consider horizontal scaling of databases.
- **Caching**: Implement caching strategies (e.g., Redis) to improve performance for frequently accessed data.
- **Mobile Optimization**: Optimize the frontend for mobile access, either through responsive design or a dedicated mobile app.
