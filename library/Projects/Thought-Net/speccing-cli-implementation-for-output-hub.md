# Prompt

Next week, I'd like to work on a couple of user interfaces for testing out the Output Hub system which I added context about earlier. I think it would be interesting to try something like a CLI but which had a better interface for capturing text (as entering paragraphs of text into a default terminal environment is difficult). Can you think of any solution in this direction that could even write and read text data from a remote postgres database?

# Output

Based on your requirements and the context provided, I can suggest a solution that combines a CLI interface with improved text input capabilities and PostgreSQL database integration. Here's an approach that could work well for your Output Hub system:

1. CLI Framework with Enhanced Text Input:
Use a combination of the `prompt_toolkit` library and `click` to create a more user-friendly CLI interface. This will allow for better text input handling, including multi-line input and syntax highlighting.

2. Database Integration:
Utilize `psycopg2` or `SQLAlchemy` for PostgreSQL database interactions.

3. Rich Text Display:
Incorporate the `rich` library for improved text formatting and display in the terminal.

Here's a conceptual implementation:

```python
from prompt_toolkit import PromptSession
from prompt_toolkit.lexers import PygmentsLexer
from pygments.lexers.sql import SqlLexer
import click
import psycopg2
from rich.console import Console
from rich.syntax import Syntax

# Database connection setup
conn = psycopg2.connect("dbname=your_db user=your_user password=your_password host=your_host")
cur = conn.cursor()

# Rich console for formatted output
console = Console()

# Prompt session for enhanced input
session = PromptSession(lexer=PygmentsLexer(SqlLexer))

@click.command()
def cli():
    while True:
        try:
            # Multi-line input with syntax highlighting
            user_input = session.prompt("Enter your text (Ctrl+D to finish):\n", multiline=True)
            
            # Store input in database
            cur.execute("INSERT INTO outputs (content) VALUES (%s) RETURNING id", (user_input,))
            output_id = cur.fetchone()[0]
            conn.commit()
            
            console.print(f"Stored with ID: {output_id}", style="bold green")
            
            # Retrieve and display stored text
            cur.execute("SELECT content FROM outputs WHERE id = %s", (output_id,))
            stored_text = cur.fetchone()[0]
            
            console.print("Stored text:", style="bold blue")
            syntax = Syntax(stored_text, "sql", theme="monokai", line_numbers=True)
            console.print(syntax)
            
        except KeyboardInterrupt:
            break

if __name__ == "__main__":
    cli()
```

This solution offers several advantages:

1. Enhanced Text Input: The `PromptSession` from `prompt_toolkit` allows for multi-line input with syntax highlighting, making it easier to enter longer texts or SQL queries.

2. Database Integration: It uses `psycopg2` to connect to and interact with a PostgreSQL database, allowing you to store and retrieve text data.

3. Improved Output: The `rich` library is used to format and display text with syntax highlighting, making the output more readable.

4. CLI Structure: `click` is used to structure the CLI, making it easy to add more commands and options in the future.

To use this, you would need to install the required libraries:

```
pip install prompt_toolkit click psycopg2-binary pygments rich
```

This approach provides a more user-friendly interface for text input and output while maintaining the CLI structure. It also integrates with a PostgreSQL database for storing and retrieving data, which aligns with your Output Hub system's requirements.

Remember to adjust the database connection details and table structure to match your specific PostgreSQL setup. You might also want to add error handling and more sophisticated database operations as needed for your Output Hub system.

# Input

To be clear - this could be executed within a terminal?

# Output

Yes, the solution I proposed could indeed be executed within a terminal. Here's a breakdown of how it would work:

1. Terminal-Based Execution:
   The script I provided is designed to run as a command-line interface (CLI) application. You would execute it from your terminal or command prompt.

2. Enhanced Text Input:
   While running in the terminal, it uses the `prompt_toolkit` library to provide an enhanced text input experience. This allows for multi-line input, syntax highlighting, and better text editing capabilities than a standard terminal input.

3. Improved Output Display:
   The `rich` library is used to format and display text output in the terminal with features like syntax highlighting and colored text, making it more readable than standard terminal output.

4. Database Interaction:
   The script connects to a PostgreSQL database (which could be local or remote) to store and retrieve data, all while running within the terminal environment.

To use this script, you would:

1. Install the required Python libraries.
2. Set up your PostgreSQL database and update the connection details in the script.
3. Run the script from your terminal using a command like `python your_script_name.py`.

Once running, you'd interact with the application entirely through the terminal interface. It would prompt you for input, store that input in the database, and then display the stored text back to you, all within the terminal window.

This approach gives you the efficiency and scriptability of a CLI tool, combined with improved text input and output capabilities that make it more suitable for handling larger amounts of text than a standard terminal interface.
