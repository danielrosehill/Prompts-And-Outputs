# Prompt

I'm using KDE Plasma on Fedora Linux. KDE Plasma uses Wayland. I use 3 x AOC E2275SWJ display screens. Are there any tools that would allow me to dim the screen brightness

# Output

Based on your specific setup using KDE Plasma on Fedora Linux with Wayland and 3 AOC E2275SWJ external monitors, here are some options to control screen brightness:

1. DDCCi Plasmoid:
   This KDE Plasma widget is designed to work with external monitors and should be compatible with Wayland. It uses DDC/CI protocol to adjust monitor settings.

   - You can install it from the KDE Store or GitHub: https://github.com/davidhi7/ddcci-plasmoid
   - It integrates well with the KDE Plasma desktop and can be used as a standalone widget or in the system tray.
   - This is likely your best option as it's designed specifically for KDE Plasma and external monitors.

2. DDCUtil:
   This is a command-line tool that the DDCCi Plasmoid uses under the hood. You can use it directly if you prefer command-line tools:

   ```
   sudo dnf install ddcutil
   ```

   Usage:
   ```
   ddcutil setvcp 10 50  # Set brightness to 50%
   ```

   You may need to add your user to the i2c group:
   ```
   sudo usermod -aG i2c $USER
   ```

3. Brightness Controller:
   This is a Python-based GUI application that can adjust brightness on multiple monitors:

   ```
   sudo dnf install brightness-controller
   ```

   While not specifically designed for Wayland, it might work in your setup.

4. KDE System Settings:
   Check if the built-in KDE display settings (System Settings > Display and Monitor > Gamma) allow you to adjust brightness for your external monitors.

For your AOC E2275SWJ monitors, the DDCCi Plasmoid or DDCUtil are likely the best options, as they can control the actual hardware brightness settings of external monitors via the DDC/CI protocol. These tools should work well with Wayland on KDE Plasma.

Remember to check if your monitors have DDC/CI support enabled in their on-screen display menu. If you encounter any issues, you might need to experiment with different tools to find what works best with your specific hardware configuration.
