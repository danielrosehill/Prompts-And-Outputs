# Prompt

Sometimes I start new Github projects just to create a place to hold the first seeds of open ended ideas. One such idea is a geopolitical data workspace to model geopolitical trends involving Israel. I have some early ideas. I believe in "building in public" and that open-sourcing doesn't mean just sharing things when they're perfect, but sharing projects from the first stages of their evolution. But then the anxious part of my brain tells me that I should only share things when they're "polished". Give me some reasons to go with the full open source model. And suggest some ways I can share projects emphasizing that they're works in progress.

# Output

Adopting the full **open-source model** from the beginning can be a powerful approach, especially when it comes to projects that are open-ended and evolving like your **geopolitical data workspace**. Here are several reasons why you should embrace the idea of **"building in public"** and share your project early:

### **Reasons to Go with the Full Open Source Model**:

1. **Collaborative Growth**:
   - Sharing your project early allows others to contribute ideas, code, or resources, often resulting in faster and more diverse growth. Open-source communities can offer different perspectives that you might not have considered.

2. **Accountability and Motivation**:
   - When you share your work publicly, it creates a sense of accountability and encourages you to keep working on it, even in its rough stages. You’re more likely to stay committed when others are watching and contributing.

3. **Feedback from the Start**:
   - By sharing early, you get valuable feedback on your ideas, structure, and functionality. Early adopters can identify issues, offer suggestions, or even catch problems that might not have occurred to you.

4. **Transparency in Evolution**:
   - Open-sourcing from the start demonstrates the **evolution** of your project, which can inspire others and create a narrative around how something goes from idea to polished product. This transparency can make your work more relatable and accessible to other developers.

5. **Learning Opportunities**:
   - Building in public lets you learn from others while also sharing your own knowledge. Seeing how others contribute can help you improve your own skills and understand how different people approach problems.

6. **Creating a Community**:
   - Sharing the project early helps build a community of collaborators, testers, and advocates around your idea. Some people may be excited to join your project and help push it forward, even in its earliest stages.

7. **Avoid Perfectionism**:
   - Waiting for a project to be "polished" often delays progress and may lead to perfectionism that hinders creativity. Embracing the fact that projects are never truly "finished" helps avoid stagnation.

8. **Encourage Forks and Derivatives**:
   - Early open-sourcing encourages others to **fork** your project or create derivative works that may solve problems or add features you hadn’t considered, enhancing the ecosystem around your project.

9. **Visibility and Recognition**:
   - Publishing early versions of your work creates an opportunity for more visibility and recognition. The sooner you share, the sooner others can discover, use, or contribute to your project. It can also showcase your **willingness to experiment and innovate**.

10. **Documenting the Journey**:
    - By releasing work in progress, you document the entire journey of the project. This not only shows the iterative development process but also helps others who are learning by providing insights into the challenges and decisions at each step.

### **Ways to Share Projects as Works in Progress**:

1. **Clearly Label the Project as "Work in Progress"**:
   - Include **“WIP” (Work in Progress)** in your README file, project description, and even the repository title if appropriate. You can also add tags like **"experimental"**, **"early-stage"**, or **"alpha"** to set expectations.
   - Example in your README:  
     > "This project is an early-stage experiment and is actively evolving. Contributions and feedback are welcome as we continue to explore its full potential!"

2. **Use a Versioning Strategy**:
   - Keep early versions labeled clearly (e.g., v0.1, v0.2) to emphasize that these are not the final versions. Semantic versioning helps signal to the community that the project is still in development.
   
3. **Create a “Roadmap” or “To-Do” Section**:
   - Share your **vision** for the project, including ideas that are not yet implemented. A **roadmap** will let people know what’s coming and invite contributors to help build toward future features.
   - Example:  
     > "Planned Features:  
     >  - Visualization of geopolitical data  
     >  - Integrations with news APIs  
     >  - User-submitted geopolitical models  
     > Contributions are welcome in any of these areas!"

4. **Encourage Community Contributions**:
   - Add a **Contributing.md** file that explicitly invites others to help build out certain features or ideas. You can frame it positively by saying the project **"needs help"** in specific areas, reinforcing that it’s a collaborative effort.
   - Example:  
     > "We welcome all contributions! This project is a work in progress, and we’re open to ideas, suggestions, and improvements."

5. **Create “Good First Issue” Labels**:
   - Tag certain issues as **"Good First Issue"** to attract contributors who might want to help with small tasks while acknowledging that it’s an evolving project.
   
6. **Document Your Journey**:
   - Keep a **changelog** or blog (e.g., on GitHub’s Wiki or personal blog) that documents the progress and updates. Share **milestones** and **lessons learned** to make it clear that the project is in motion and constantly improving.
   
7. **Emphasize Iterative Development**:
   - In your README and communications, explain that the project follows an **iterative development process** where each iteration brings new features or refinements. This helps set the expectation that the project will grow over time.
   
8. **Use GitHub Discussions**:
   - Enable **GitHub Discussions** for your project so that you can engage with the community, gather feedback, and discuss future features. This is a great way to let people see it as a collaborative work in progress.

9. **Highlight Experimental Features**:
   - Create a separate section for experimental or prototype features in your README and clearly state that these features are **“subject to change”** or **“experimental”**.

10. **Showcase Work-in-Progress Visuals**:
    - Use screenshots, diagrams, or mockups of what you're working on to make it more engaging. It visually demonstrates progress and sets the tone for what’s coming.
    - Example:  
      > "Here’s a preview of the initial UI for tracking geopolitical trends (subject to change as we continue building)."

By openly sharing your geopolitical data workspace project, you invite **collaboration, innovation**, and a **community** to form around it. The emphasis on **transparency** and **iteration** can help shift the focus away from the need for perfection and instead celebrate the project’s growth and development over time.
