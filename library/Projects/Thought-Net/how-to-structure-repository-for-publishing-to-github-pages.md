# Prompt

How should I structure my repository for publishing documentation via github pages? Let's say I want to use the root as the source

# Output

To structure your repository for publishing documentation via GitHub Pages using the root as the source, consider the following layout:

```
my-docs-repo/
│
├── index.html            # Main entry point for your documentation
├── about.html            # Optional: About page
├── styles.css            # Custom styles for your documentation
├── scripts.js            # Optional: Any JavaScript functionality
│
├── docs/                 # Folder for additional documentation files
│   ├── guide1.md         # Markdown files for detailed guides
│   ├── guide2.md
│   └── images/           # Directory for images used in documentation
│       └── example.png
│
└── README.md             # Overview of the repository and documentation
```

### Key Points:
- **`index.html`**: Serve as the landing page.
- **Markdown Files**: Use them for detailed documentation; GitHub Pages can render Markdown.
- **Assets**: Keep styles, scripts, and images organized. 

This structure will allow users to easily navigate your documentation and take advantage of GitHub Pages' features.
