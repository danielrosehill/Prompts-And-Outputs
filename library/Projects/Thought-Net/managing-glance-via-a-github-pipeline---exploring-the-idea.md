# Prompt

I've installed Glances and have it running on a server using Docker. It looks like a nice tool that works via a single .yml configuration file. My question is this. Editing live on the server is very cumbersome. Would it be possible to set up a Github repository that I use to update this configuration file and then deploy that onto the server? Or is that a stupid approach for managing a single file on a remote?

# Output

Setting up a **GitHub repository** to manage and update a single configuration file (like the `.yml` file for Glances) is not a "stupid" approach. In fact, it's quite common in DevOps practices for managing configurations efficiently, even for a single file, particularly when you're using **Docker** or any form of **infrastructure as code**.

Here’s how this approach can be beneficial and how you can set it up:

### Benefits of Managing a Single File via GitHub

1. **Version Control**:
   - GitHub provides version control, which is especially useful if you need to track changes, revert to previous configurations, or collaborate with others.
  
2. **Backup & Security**:
   - Storing your `.yml` file in a GitHub repository ensures you have a backup. You can also take advantage of GitHub’s security features, such as branch protections or commit signing.
  
3. **Deployment Automation**:
   - By integrating GitHub with your server, you can set up **automatic deployment** whenever a change is made to the `.yml` file. This removes the need to manually update the file on your server.

4. **CI/CD Pipelines**:
   - You can implement a simple **CI/CD pipeline** using tools like **GitHub Actions**, **Jenkins**, or even basic shell scripts to pull the latest version of the `.yml` file from your GitHub repository and deploy it to your server automatically.

### Setup Process:

1. **Create a GitHub Repository**:
   - Create a private or public repository on GitHub dedicated to managing your Glances configuration.
   - Add the `.yml` file to the repository.

2. **Deploy Script on Your Server**:
   - On your server, write a simple script that pulls the latest version of the `.yml` file from GitHub:
     ```bash
     #!/bin/bash
     git pull origin main  # Pull the latest version from the repo
     docker restart glances  # Restart Glances to apply the new config
     ```
   - Place this script on your server in a convenient location.

3. **GitHub Webhooks or Automation**:
   - Option 1: **Manual Sync**: SSH into your server and run the script whenever you update the config file on GitHub.
   - Option 2: **Automated Sync**: Set up a **GitHub webhook** or **GitHub Actions** that triggers the deployment script on your server whenever the `.yml` file is updated. Tools like `rsync`, `scp`, or even Docker Compose can be used to automate the syncing process.

4. **Optional: Docker Volume**:
   - If you prefer not to restart the container after each change, you could map the `.yml` file as a **Docker volume** from a directory on your host. This would let you update the configuration without stopping the container.

     Example Docker command to mount the config file:
     ```bash
     docker run -v /path/to/glances.yml:/glances/conf/glances.yml glances
     ```

### Alternatives:

1. **Direct File Sync**:
   If you're only managing a single file, you could skip GitHub entirely and use **rsync** or **scp** to sync the `.yml` file directly from your local machine to the server. This would simplify the process but lack version control.

2. **Configuration Management Tools**:
   If your infrastructure grows or you manage more servers, consider using tools like **Ansible**, **Puppet**, or **Chef** to handle configuration management for multiple files and servers in an automated way.

### Conclusion:
Using GitHub for managing a single configuration file like the Glances `.yml` file is perfectly reasonable. It gives you version control, ease of access, and backup while allowing for automation. Though it might seem overkill for a single file, it can scale well if your server or configuration management becomes more complex.
