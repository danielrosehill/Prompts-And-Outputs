You can easily list all `.json` files in a directory and output them into a `.txt` file in Python using the `os` or `pathlib` module. Hereâ€™s an example Python script that accomplishes this task:

### Python Script:

```python
import os

# Define the directory containing the JSON files
directory_path = '/path/to/your/directory'

# Define the output text file
output_file_path = '/path/to/your/output_file.txt'

# Get the list of all .json files in the directory
json_files = [f for f in os.listdir(directory_path) if f.endswith('.json')]

# Write the list of files to a .txt file
with open(output_file_path, 'w') as output_file:
    for json_file in json_files:
        output_file.write(json_file + '\n')

print(f"List of JSON files written to {output_file_path}")
```

### Explanation:
- **`os.listdir(directory_path)`**: Lists all files in the specified directory.
- **`f.endswith('.json')`**: Filters the list to include only files that end with `.json`.
- **Writing to a file**: The filtered list of JSON files is written to a `.txt` file, one per line.

### Output:
The `.txt` file will contain the names of all the `.json` files in the specified directory, with each file name on a new line.

### Example Output in `.txt`:
```
file1.json
file2.json
file3.json
```

You can run this script to generate the `.txt` file with the list of `.json` files from any directory. Just replace the `directory_path` and `output_file_path` with your actual folder paths.
