# Output

Based on the detailed output you've provided, it appears that your system is correctly configured for using ddcutil. Here's an analysis of the key points:

1. System Information:
   - You're running Fedora 40 with Linux kernel 6.10.11-200.fc40.x86_64
   - ddcutil version: 2.1.3

2. GPU Information:
   - AMD Radeon RX 7700 XT / 7800 XT (Navi 32)
   - Using the amdgpu driver

3. I2C Devices:
   - Multiple I2C devices are detected (i2c-0 to i2c-8)
   - The relevant ones for monitors are likely i2c-2, i2c-3, i2c-4, and i2c-5 (AMDGPU DM i2c hw bus 0-3)

4. Permissions:
   - You're running the checks as root, which has full access to all I2C devices
   - All /dev/i2c-* devices have read/write permissions for the root user

5. Driver and Module Status:
   - The i2c_dev module is correctly loaded

Given this information, your system appears to be properly set up for using ddcutil. The fact that you're experiencing issues suggests that the problem might be related to:

1. Monitor compatibility: Some monitors don't fully support DDC/CI or have quirks in their implementation.
2. Connection type: Try different ports (HDMI vs DisplayPort) if available.
3. Specific monitor settings: Ensure DDC/CI is enabled in your AOC 2275W monitors' OSD menus.

To further diagnose the issue:

1. Try running ddcutil commands for a specific display, e.g.:
   ```
   ddcutil --bus 3 detect
   ddcutil --bus 3 getvcp 10
   ```
   (Replace 3 with other bus numbers if needed)

2. Use the verbose mode to get more detailed error messages:
   ```
   ddcutil --verbose getvcp 10
   ```

3. If you're still encountering issues, try adjusting the I2C communication timing:
   ```
   ddcutil --sleep-multiplier 4 getvcp 10
   ```

4. Check if the issue persists when using a different user account (non-root) with proper I2C group permissions.

If these steps don't resolve the issue, it might be worth checking for any known issues or quirks with the AOC 2275W monitors and ddcutil, or considering alternative brightness control methods for these specific monitors.
