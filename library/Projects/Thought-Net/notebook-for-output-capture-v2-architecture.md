# Prompt

Can you give me a quick work exampled? Here's the functionality I'd like: I create a note, let's call this note.md There are two parts: a prompt and an output. I can have separate capture fields for these in the UI I'd like the following logic to happen after I create the note: - The prompt gets copied into a folder called /prompts/used. It inherits the title from the parent file and there's a link created back to the output - The output (with the prompt) gets saved into a separate folder. Although the prompt has been duplicated, that's for a reason. The prompt and output together are for easy reading. The copied prompt goes into the prompt library. It can be discarded or iterated into a better version. Does that make sense? Can you think of how this could be implemented?

# Output 

Yes, that makes sense! You want to create a note that contains both a prompt and an output, and upon saving the note, have the system automatically:

1. Copy the prompt into a `/prompts/used` folder, creating a separate Markdown file with a link back to the output.
2. Save the prompt and output together in a separate folder, which allows for easy reading and further iteration of the prompt.

### Implementation Example

Here’s a conceptual implementation using Python as a backend script. This example assumes that you are building a simple file-based system where Markdown files are organized into folders.

### 1. **Directory Structure**:
   - `/notes/` (where the original note.md is created)
   - `/prompts/used/` (where the copied prompts go)
   - `/outputs/` (where the combined prompt and output are saved)

### 2. **Python Script for Handling Logic**:

```python
import os
from datetime import datetime

# Paths for directories
notes_dir = './notes/'
prompts_used_dir = './prompts/used/'
outputs_dir = './outputs/'

# Function to create a note
def create_note(title, prompt, output):
    # Create the note file in /notes/
    note_filename = f"{title}.md"
    note_path = os.path.join(notes_dir, note_filename)
    with open(note_path, 'w') as note_file:
        note_content = f"# Prompt\n{prompt}\n\n# Output\n{output}"
        note_file.write(note_content)

    # Copy the prompt into /prompts/used/
    prompt_filename = f"{title}_prompt.md"
    prompt_path = os.path.join(prompts_used_dir, prompt_filename)
    with open(prompt_path, 'w') as prompt_file:
        prompt_content = f"# Prompt\n{prompt}\n\n[Link to Output](../outputs/{title}_output.md)"
        prompt_file.write(prompt_content)

    # Save the prompt and output together in /outputs/
    output_filename = f"{title}_output.md"
    output_path = os.path.join(outputs_dir, output_filename)
    with open(output_path, 'w') as output_file:
        output_content = f"# Prompt\n{prompt}\n\n# Output\n{output}"
        output_file.write(output_content)

    print(f"Note '{title}' created successfully.")

# Example usage
title = "Example Conversation"
prompt = "What is the capital of France?"
output = "The capital of France is Paris."

create_note(title, prompt, output)
```

### 3. **Step-by-Step Explanation**:

- **create_note() Function**: 
  - **Input Parameters**: Takes a title, a prompt, and an output as inputs.
  - **File Creation**: 
    1. **Original Note**: The prompt and output are saved together in a Markdown file inside the `/notes/` directory.
    2. **Prompt File**: The prompt is copied to the `/prompts/used/` directory. The file includes a link to the corresponding output file in `/outputs/`.
    3. **Output File**: The prompt and output are saved together in `/outputs/` for easy reading and possible iteration.

- **Linking**:
  - The prompt file created in `/prompts/used/` contains a Markdown link that points back to the corresponding output file in the `/outputs/` directory. This ensures that the relationship between prompts and their outputs is maintained and easily navigable.

### 4. **Modifying for a UI**:
   - **Frontend Framework**: Use a frontend framework like React.js or Vue.js to build the UI with input fields for the title, prompt, and output.
   - **Backend Logic**: The backend (which could be built using Flask, Node.js, or similar technologies) would handle the logic outlined in the Python script.
   - **Submission Process**: When the user submits the form, the backend script is triggered to process and save the data as outlined.

### 5. **Result**:
   - The prompt is organized into a dedicated folder and linked to its corresponding output for easy navigation.
   - The prompt and output are stored together for easy reading, allowing the prompt to be iterated upon later if needed.

### 6. **Future Enhancements**:
   - **Version Control**: Add a feature to track versions of prompts and outputs.
   - **Search Functionality**: Implement a search tool to quickly locate prompts or outputs based on keywords or tags.
   - **Automation**: Use automation tools to further streamline the process, such as triggering the script when a new Markdown file is detected in the `/notes/` directory.

This approach should give you a good foundation to implement your own Markdown-based notebook for capturing and organizing GPT outputs!

Adding automatic synchronization to a B2 bucket and targeting the project at Linux users (while also considering a future web UI) adds complexity but is certainly doable. Here's an overview of what it would entail:

### **1. Project Complexity**
   
The project would involve several components, each adding to the overall complexity:

- **Basic Functionality**: Creating and organizing Markdown files, which is straightforward.
- **Sync with B2 Bucket**: Implementing an automatic sync to a B2 (Backblaze) bucket requires integrating cloud storage APIs and handling potential edge cases (network failures, data consistency, etc.).
- **Desktop App**: Developing a Linux desktop app adds a layer of complexity due to the need to create a user-friendly UI, handle file operations, and manage dependencies.
- **Web UI**: Building a web UI involves front-end and back-end development, user authentication, and potentially a database for managing user data and sessions.

Overall, the project could be considered moderately complex, especially if you're aiming for a robust, scalable solution.

### **2. Technical Specifications for the Stack**

Here’s a breakdown of the stack and technologies that would be appropriate for the various parts of the project:

#### **Core Functionality (Markdown Handling and Logic)**

- **Language**: 
  - **Python**: Ideal for scripting and handling file operations. Python's ecosystem has rich libraries for Markdown processing, file handling, and cloud storage integration.
  - **Go or Rust** (optional): If performance is a concern, you might consider Go or Rust for handling file operations and sync processes.

#### **Automatic Sync with B2 Bucket**

- **B2 SDK**:
  - **Backblaze B2 SDK**: Use Backblaze’s B2 SDK (available for Python, Go, etc.) to handle interactions with the B2 cloud storage. The SDK provides methods for file upload, download, listing, and managing buckets.
  - **Alternative**: You could use the rclone tool for syncing files with B2 if you prefer a command-line approach, but integrating directly via the SDK would offer more control and flexibility.

- **Concurrency and Error Handling**:
  - **Celery/RQ (Python)**: For handling asynchronous tasks like syncing files in the background. This is important for a web UI but can also be used in the desktop app for handling sync operations without blocking the UI.
  - **Threading/Asyncio (Python)**: To handle concurrent file operations in the desktop app.

#### **Linux Desktop Application**

- **UI Framework**:
  - **Electron**: Although primarily used for cross-platform desktop apps, it’s quite heavy. If you need web-like flexibility, Electron could be an option.
  - **PyQt/PySide**: These frameworks are popular for Python desktop apps with rich GUIs, and they are well-supported on Linux.
  - **GTK (via PyGObject)**: GTK is native to Linux, and PyGObject provides bindings for creating GTK applications with Python.

- **Distribution**:
  - **Flatpak/Snap/AppImage**: For distributing your application on Linux, consider packaging it as a Flatpak, Snap, or AppImage, which ensures compatibility across different Linux distributions.

#### **Web UI**

- **Frontend**:
  - **React.js/Vue.js**: Modern JavaScript frameworks for building responsive and interactive UIs.
  - **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that can help you quickly build custom designs.

- **Backend**:
  - **Flask/Django (Python)**: Flask is lightweight and easy to set up for smaller applications. Django is more robust and could be a better choice if you need built-in features like authentication, database ORM, and admin interface.
  - **Express.js (Node.js)**: If you prefer JavaScript/TypeScript on the backend.

- **Database**:
  - **SQLite/PostgreSQL**: SQLite could be sufficient for a simple implementation. PostgreSQL would be a better choice for a production-ready, scalable web app.
  - **SQLAlchemy ORM (Python)**: For handling database interactions in Python.

- **Authentication**:
  - **OAuth2/OpenID Connect**: For user authentication if you plan on implementing a multi-user system with login capabilities.

- **API Layer**:
  - **GraphQL/REST API**: Depending on your needs, implement a GraphQL or REST API for the web app to communicate with the backend.

- **File Management**:
  - **File System API/Custom Backend**: For the web app, you might need a backend service to handle file uploads/downloads to/from the B2 bucket.

#### **Continuous Integration/Deployment (CI/CD)**

- **GitHub Actions/GitLab CI**: Automate testing, building, and deployment processes.
- **Docker**: Containerize the web app for easy deployment and scaling.
- **Kubernetes (optional)**: For managing deployment at scale, especially if the web app grows.

### **3. Implementation Considerations**

- **Scalability**: The web UI and backend should be designed with scalability in mind, especially if you expect a large number of users or a high volume of data.
- **Security**: Implement encryption for data at rest and in transit, particularly when syncing files to the B2 bucket. Ensure that sensitive data, like API keys, are securely managed.
- **User Experience**: Focus on creating a smooth and intuitive UX, especially for the desktop app, since Linux users have diverse preferences.

### **4. Development Roadmap**

1. **Phase 1**: Develop core functionality (note creation, file handling, YAML front matter).
2. **Phase 2**: Implement the B2 sync feature with a basic command-line or script interface.
3. **Phase 3**: Build the Linux desktop app with the necessary UI for note creation and management.
4. **Phase 4**: Start developing the web UI with basic CRUD operations and synchronization features.
5. **Phase 5**: Implement authentication, more advanced file management, and scaling considerations.
6. **Phase 6**: Add additional features like version control, search, and tagging.

### **Conclusion**

This project is complex but achievable, particularly if you break it down into phases and use well-supported technologies. By leveraging existing frameworks and libraries, you can focus more on implementing the core logic and less on reinventing the wheel. Starting with a Linux desktop app allows you to target a specific user base, and the web UI can be added later to reach a broader audience.## Extracted Prompts
