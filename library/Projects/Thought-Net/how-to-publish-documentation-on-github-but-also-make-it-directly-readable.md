Yes, you can publish documentation directly using GitHub Pages. Hereâ€™s how:

1. **Create a `gh-pages` Branch**:
   - Go to your repository on GitHub.
   - Create a new branch named `gh-pages`.

2. **Add Documentation**:
   - Place your documentation files (HTML, Markdown, etc.) in the `gh-pages` branch.

3. **Enable GitHub Pages**:
   - Go to the repository settings.
   - Under the "Pages" section, select the `gh-pages` branch as the source.

4. **Accessing Documentation**:
   - Your documentation will be accessible at `https://<username>.github.io/<repo-name>`.

Users can also access the documentation through the main repository if it includes links to the published pages.
