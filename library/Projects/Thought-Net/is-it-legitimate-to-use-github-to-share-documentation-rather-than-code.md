# Prompt

Is it considered an "abuse" of Github to use it for sharing open source documentation (rather than code) or can this be considered a perfectly legitimate use of the platform?

# Output

Using GitHub to share open-source documentation is considered a legitimate use of the platform. GitHub is designed for version control and collaboration, making it suitable for both code and documentation. Many projects use GitHub to host their documentation alongside their codebase. As long as the content adheres to GitHub's terms of service, sharing documentation is perfectly acceptable and can enhance the accessibility and usability of open-source projects.
