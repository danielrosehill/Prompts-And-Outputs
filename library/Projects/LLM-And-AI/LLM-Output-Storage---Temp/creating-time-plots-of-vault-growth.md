# Prompt
This is the current folder structure of my Obsidian vault. I would like to create some graphs plotting the growth of all 3 core folders i have labelled over time. DO you have any suggestions for how I could do that? And how can I Create time plots if I'm not capturing the data in the files? Is it in metadata?

# Output

To create time plots showing the growth of the three core folders (`Agents`, `Outputs`, and `Prompts`) in your Obsidian vault over time, you’ll need to capture the creation or modification dates of the files within these folders. Here's how you can approach this:

### **1. Capturing Timestamps from Metadata**
   - **File Metadata**: Each file in your vault has associated metadata that includes the creation date and last modified date. These timestamps can be used to plot the growth of files over time.
   - **Obsidian Plugin**: If you haven’t already, consider using the **Obsidian Metadata Explorer** plugin or similar tools that can help you extract this metadata from your files.

### **2. Automating the Data Collection**
   - **Script to Extract Metadata**:
     - Write a script in Python to traverse the directories (`Agents`, `Outputs`, and `Prompts`), read the file metadata, and collect the timestamps.
     - This script can save the data into a CSV file or directly generate a plot.

### **3. Plotting the Data**
   - **Matplotlib/Pandas**: Use Python libraries like `Matplotlib` and `Pandas` to create time series plots.
   - **Example Script**:
     ```python
     import os
     import pandas as pd
     import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
     from datetime import datetime

     # Paths to your directories
     directories = {
         'Agents': '/path/to/your/obsidian/vault/Agents',
         'Outputs': '/path/to/your/obsidian/vault/Outputs',
         'Prompts': '/path/to/your/obsidian/vault/Prompts',
     }

     data = []

     # Traverse directories and capture timestamps
     for label, dir_path in directories.items():
         for root, _, files in os.walk(dir_path):
             for file in files:
                 if file.endswith('.md'):
                     file_path = os.path.join(root, file)
                     mod_time = os.path.getmtime(file_path)
                     data.append({
                         'folder': label,
                         'timestamp': datetime.fromtimestamp(mod_time),
                     })

     # Create a DataFrame
     df = pd.DataFrame(data)

     # Resample and count files by day
     df.set_index('timestamp', inplace=True)
     df = df.groupby('folder').resample('D').size().unstack().fillna(0)

     # Plotting cumulative growth
     df.cumsum().plot(kind='line')
     plt.title('Growth of Core Folders Over Time')
     plt.xlabel('Date')
     plt.ylabel('Cumulative Number of Files')
     plt.legend(title='Folder')
     plt.show()
     ```

### **4. Running the Script**
   - **Environment**: Run this script in a Python environment. Make sure you have the necessary libraries installed (`pip install pandas matplotlib`).
   - **Output**: The script will generate a line plot showing the cumulative growth of files in the `Agents`, `Outputs`, and `Prompts` folders over time.

### **5. Future Automation**
   - **Cron Job/Task Scheduler**: Set up a cron job (on Linux) or use Task Scheduler (on Windows) to run this script periodically and update the plots automatically.
   - **Integrating with Obsidian**: If you want to integrate this into Obsidian, you could create a plugin or use an existing one that allows you to run scripts and generate visualizations directly within your vault.

### **6. Using Templater or Dataview Plugins**
   - **Templater**: This plugin allows you to run custom scripts within Obsidian. You could set up a template to regularly extract file metadata and generate plots.
   - **Dataview**: If your metadata is stored as YAML front matter, you could use the Dataview plugin to query and visualize growth directly within Obsidian.

### **Conclusion**
By capturing file metadata (creation or modification dates), you can effectively plot the growth of your `Agents`, `Outputs`, and `Prompts` folders over time. This process involves extracting timestamps, aggregating the data, and using a plotting tool like Matplotlib to visualize the results. This will give you insightful visualizations of your vault’s growth, helping you track your work and progress over time.## Extracted Prompts
