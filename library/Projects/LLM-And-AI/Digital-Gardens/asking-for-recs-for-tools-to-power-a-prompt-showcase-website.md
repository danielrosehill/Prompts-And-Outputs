# Prompt

I am doing a lot of exploratory work currently in the realm of LLMs and AI. I would love to have a web property that I can to show off some of my prompt engineering strategies and to share data, code snippets, and data visualisation. I'm thinking of something like a mashup between a blog and a data notebook. Ideally, I'd have a CMS, but I'm also to the open of using a headless approach. I like drafting in markdown. Can you think of a good tool?    

# Output

For your web property focused on **LLMs, AI prompt engineering, code snippets, and data visualization**, you want a solution that balances **flexibility** (like a CMS) and **data-centric capabilities**. Here are some tools and platforms that could work for you:

### 1. **Jupyter Book (for Data Storytelling and Visualization)**
   - **What it is**: A tool for creating **books and blogs** with Jupyter Notebooks. You can write in markdown, incorporate code, and visualize data. It’s great for combining **narrative, code, and visualizations** all in one place.
   - **Why it’s good**: You can mix markdown (for writing) with code (for AI/ML work), allowing for dynamic content generation with live visualizations. It can be hosted statically on platforms like GitHub Pages.
   - **CMS/Headless**: This would be a **headless** solution, meaning you'd manually handle content generation and deployment.
   - **Example use cases**: Sharing code snippets, visualizations, AI experiments.
   - **Website**: [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/)

### 2. **Hugo + Netlify CMS (Markdown-based Static Site Generator)**
   - **What it is**: **Hugo** is a static site generator optimized for speed, and it integrates well with **Netlify CMS** for managing content. You can write everything in markdown, and Netlify CMS allows you to manage your posts and other content through a GUI.
   - **Why it’s good**: It’s very flexible for building **custom blog-like properties**, allowing you to include data visualizations using libraries like **D3.js**, **Chart.js**, or **Plotly**. It also supports **markdown** natively, which is a big advantage for drafting posts.
   - **CMS/Headless**: You can use **Netlify CMS** to manage content or use a **headless** approach for more control.
   - **Example use cases**: A data-driven blog where you share your prompt engineering experiments, visualizations, and code.
   - **Website**: [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/)

### 3. **ObservableHQ (for Data Visualization and Code Snippets)**
   - **What it is**: **ObservableHQ** is a platform designed for building **interactive data visualizations** with JavaScript. It’s focused on creating shareable, interactive notebooks where you can combine narrative, code, and data visualizations.
   - **Why it’s good**: It's perfect for showcasing **live code**, **AI demos**, and **interactive visualizations**. You can use **Markdown** to explain and document your experiments. 
   - **CMS/Headless**: This is more of a **data-centric notebook** than a CMS but could serve as a public-facing platform for technical content.
   - **Example use cases**: AI visualizations, live demos, and code showcasing with interactivity.
   - **Website**: [ObservableHQ](https://observablehq.com/)

### 4. **Ghost (Headless or Full CMS with Markdown Support)**
   - **What it is**: **Ghost** is a modern open-source CMS that’s popular for its markdown-based editor. It’s designed to be **lightweight** and **fast**, and can be used as either a traditional CMS or a **headless CMS**.
   - **Why it’s good**: If you want more control over content, like a traditional blog with **posts and data visualizations**, Ghost is a good fit. It can also be set up with API access for more **dynamic data integration**.
   - **CMS/Headless**: Works both as a **full CMS** and as a **headless CMS** if you want to decouple the backend and front-end.
   - **Example use cases**: Sharing code, blog posts, visualizations, and prompt engineering strategies with content management.
   - **Website**: [Ghost](https://ghost.org/)

### 5. **Gridsome + Headless CMS (for Static Site and Data Visualizations)**
   - **What it is**: **Gridsome** is a Vue.js-based static site generator, great for building modern web properties with **GraphQL** to pull in data from multiple sources. Combined with a headless CMS (like Strapi or Contentful), it provides a flexible platform for sharing **data, code snippets**, and visualizations.
   - **Why it’s good**: Gridsome allows you to create a blog-like platform with **dynamic data fetching**. It supports **markdown** for content and can handle **interactive visualizations** with JavaScript libraries.
   - **CMS/Headless**: Typically used in a **headless** architecture.
   - **Example use cases**: Sharing prompt engineering strategies, interactive AI visualizations, and detailed data stories.
   - **Website**: [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org/)

### 6. **MkDocs (Simple Static Documentation Site Generator)**
   - **What it is**: A static site generator geared towards creating **technical documentation** sites. It supports markdown and can be extended with **plugins** for data visualization and code rendering.
   - **Why it’s good**: MkDocs is perfect for creating a streamlined, **documentation-style website** where you share insights, experiments, and visualizations. It’s fast, easy to set up, and great for **technical content**.
   - **CMS/Headless**: This would be a **headless approach**, similar to Jupyter Book.
   - **Example use cases**: A clean, structured website for code snippets, AI/LLM experiment results, and data visualizations.
   - **Website**: [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/)

### Conclusion:
- **If you want a structured blog-like experience** with CMS features, **Ghost** or **Hugo + Netlify CMS** would be good choices.
- **If you’re more focused on data notebooks and interactivity**, **ObservableHQ** or **Jupyter Book** could be better suited.
- **For a flexible, more custom data platform**, consider **Gridsome** with a headless CMS.

Each of these options will allow you to share **data visualizations**, **code snippets**, and **technical writing** in a format suited for your needs. Let me know which approach resonates with you!
