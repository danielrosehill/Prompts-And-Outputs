*Note: this repository consists of the outputs of large language models (LLMs). In many cases, these are unedited or minimally edited. The information provided is for demonstrative purposes only and is intended to highlight constraints and capabilities in LLM applications and prompt engineering strategies.*


# Prompt

Can you suggest a document template which I could use for formatting these context documents?

# Output

Based on the information provided and the best practices for document templates, I can suggest a structured format for your context documents. This template will help organize the information clearly and make it easier for LLMs to process and understand the content. Here's a suggested template:

## Context Document Template

```markdown
---
Document Title: [Title of the document]
Content:
[Main content of the document goes here. This can be multiple paragraphs or sections as needed.]

Event Date: [Date of the event, if applicable]

Document Groups: [List of relevant groups, separated by commas]

Document Taxonomy/Tags: [List of tags or taxonomies, separated by commas]

Source Document Summary:
[A brief summary of the source document]

URL: [URL of the document, if applicable]
---
```

This template uses markdown formatting, which is compatible with Obsidian and many other note-taking applications. Here are some key features of this template:

1. It uses a clear header for each field, making it easy to identify different components of the document[3].

2. The template separates each field with line breaks, improving readability for both humans and AI models[3].

3. It uses triple dashes (---) at the beginning and end of each document to clearly delineate separate context documents[3].

4. The "Content" field allows for multiple paragraphs or sections, providing flexibility for various types of information.

5. Fields like "Document Groups" and "Document Taxonomy/Tags" are set up to accept multiple entries separated by commas, making it easy to categorize and search documents.

6. The "Source Document Summary" field provides space for a brief overview of the original document, which can be useful for quick reference.

By using this consistent format across all your context documents, you'll create a structured repository that's easy to navigate and ideal for AI processing. This approach will help you effectively store LLM outputs, job-related information, and other contextual data in your Obsidian vault[1][2].
