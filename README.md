# Prompts And Outputs

## Purpose Statement

This repository tracks (loosely, non-programatically) the LLM outputs that I share on [Daniel Goes Prompting](https://danielgoesprompting.com). 

'Daniel Goes Prompting' is an open access repository of LLM prompts and outputs intended to be a resource to anyone wishing to understand real LLM performance (and track it over time).
